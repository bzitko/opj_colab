00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:32,111
Griffin.
Griffin.

3
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,600
Griffin, what did I say?

4
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,819
I'm in the middle
of a game.

5
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,271
Yeah, you can't play that in the car
unless you take your Dramamine.

6
00:01:37,296 --> 00:01:39,823
It's too late for Dramamine,
we're practically there.

7
00:01:39,848 --> 00:01:42,506
Don't roll your eyes at me.
You want him puking in the car again?

8
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,324
- I said I was sorry.
- No. It's not your fault.

9
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:47,661
- That was smelly.
- Was not. It was only an accident.

10
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,759
- Nobody is blaming you, honeybun.
- It was smelly.

11
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,582
- Following the GPS.
- It stinks.

12
00:01:51,607 --> 00:01:53,220
Look.
That's left end of Kitty Hawk.

13
00:01:53,245 --> 00:01:54,645
No, no, no...
Dad.

14
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,076
- There's no way we can live here.
- Oh. Come on.

15
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,706
You haven't even
seen the house yet.

16
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:00,200
- There are power lines.
- Relax.

17
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:01,900
I can feel the tumors
swarming already.

18
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,225
- No one is getting tumors.
- What tumors?

19
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,477
- It's a joke, dumbass.
- It's a joke, dumbass!

20
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,267
- Don't say that, sweetie.
<I>- Make a U-turn in 50 feet.</i>.

21
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:12,793
- What?
- Oh. You miss the turn?

22
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,647
- Yes ma'am.
- Dumbass.

23
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:16,843
- Okay. - Wee...
- Madison.

24
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,457
- Wee...
- Ha-ha.

25
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,510
Come on.

26
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,305
Nice right?

27
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,579
- Yeah.
- Cosy.

28
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:56,875
- I think it's nice.
- I think it's nice too.

29
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:57,968
Piggycorn too.

30
00:02:57,993 --> 00:03:00,687
- Mr. And Mrs. Bowen.
- Hi. Sorry we're late.

31
00:03:00,712 --> 00:03:03,200
We missed that turn
on Kitty Hawk.

32
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,018
Yeah.
Modern technology.

33
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:07,871
He's gonna go right in.
Start checking it out.

34
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,197
That hoop is cool.

35
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:13,794
Nice tree, huh?

36
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,300
That's been here longer
than any of the houses.

37
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,081
You want to climb?

38
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:19,936
Mom, Mom there's a kitchen.

39
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,913
- Oh wow.
- I'm going to see my bedroom.

40
00:03:21,938 --> 00:03:23,832
Slow down please,
on the stairs.

41
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:26,627
That security system works.
The owner was a bit of a technophile.

42
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:29,045
So this house is wire proof
for whatever you might need.

43
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,319
You'll noticed.
He puts speakers in all the walls.

44
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,242
So you can hear
music in every room.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,757
Including the john.

46
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:38,597

47
00:03:38,622 --> 00:03:40,981
Will either of you two
be commuting to work?

48
00:03:41,006 --> 00:03:43,852
Not me.
I'll be home with the kids.

49
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:45,540
Amy is an amazing writer.

50
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:47,476
- Oh Eric. Come on.
- She is.

51
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,595
She's being humble right now,
she is very good.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,062
I'm trying to be
but you know.

53
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,444
It's just hard to find time.

54
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,292
I know, believe me.
I have two of my own.

55
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:59,060
They're in college.
I'm glad they're gone.

56
00:03:59,358 --> 00:04:02,788
I mean,
I'm getting my life back.

57
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:04,665
Where did you say that
you worked, Mr. Bowen?

58
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,742
John Deere Corporate
over at Marlene.

59
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,946
That's a wonderful company.
We have a riding mower.

60
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:12,417
It's lasted us for years.
Oh, we love John Deere.

61
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:16,427
Oh well. I'd be very flattered
right now if I hadn't get laid off.

62
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,037
- Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realise that.
- That's alright.

63
00:04:18,062 --> 00:04:20,258
No. They do have a quality.

64
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,732
Yeah they do, but.

65
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,540
No, they were making some
cut backs and I was...

66
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,229
Hey Eric.
Come look at this.

67
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:28,795
I love to honey but
I'm in the middle of a

68
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,847
very awkward exchange
with our realtor right now.

69
00:04:30,872 --> 00:04:33,392
- Come see.
- Is that alright?

70
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,525
- Don't go anywhere.
- Please.

71
00:04:36,346 --> 00:04:38,891
- Hey. Oh hey.
- There is a field.

72
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,635
- Whose property is that?
<I>- Oh, that's city property.</i>

73
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,777
That's a good place for a bushfire.

74
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:48,120
We have to try to like this.

75
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:50,793
Okay, I'll try.

76
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:53,305
Would you like to
see the upstairs?

77
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,869
Yes, I would.

78
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:58,143
And this is the master
that you're showing us!

79
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:00,861
- That's correct.
- Oh.

80
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,663
How is it up there, kiddo?

81
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:04,144
I like our house better.

82
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:06,943
Oh, that's not an option honey.

83
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:10,141
You call that a bedroom,
but really it's an attic.

84
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,397
That could be where
Griffin sleeps.

85
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,750
It's funny.

86
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:34,888
Yeah.

87
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:38,331
Piggycorn?

88
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:44,444
No, Piggycorn is not my baby.
She's just a doll.

89
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,538
She is half pig and
half unicorn. See.

90
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,103
She has a little horn.
Honk-honk.

91
00:05:49,128 --> 00:05:51,499
Who are you talking to?

92
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,424
No one.

93
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:58,033
Mom, we like this house.

94
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:29,567
Jesus.
This really is stuck.

95
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:32,991
That's probably just moisture,
it rained last week.

96
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,053
Okay, well ...
I don't know.

97
00:06:38,078 --> 00:06:40,359
All the houses are like this
in our price range.

98
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:43,414
And this is the least sucky
one we've seen so I think.

99
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:45,490
- Maybe.
Yeah maybe ...

100
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:48,925
Foreclosure has hit this
neighbourhood really hard.

101
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:51,702
There's some wiggle room
on the price.

102
00:06:52,268 --> 00:06:54,774
How much wiggle
are we talking?

103
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,254
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

104
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,397
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

105
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:03,651
- Come on. Man!
- Sorry.

106
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:07,664
- Perfect.
- Buck up, kiddo. It's temporary.

107
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:09,701
We ruin your life.

108
00:07:09,726 --> 00:07:12,495
- Good.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,989
Heh-heh-
hee-hee..

110
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,019
What if the bad guys
break in a window?

111
00:07:34,044 --> 00:07:35,678
Then the alarm will still go off.

112
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:37,912
But what if the bad guys
cut the wires to the alarm?

113
00:07:37,913 --> 00:07:39,658
The wires are in the house.

114
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:42,784
But what if the bad guys went to the
power plant and cut the wires there?

115
00:07:42,823 --> 00:07:45,230
Uh well. They will be
electrocuted and then if

116
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:47,194
their... then they'll be dead.
And if they're dead

117
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:48,756
then they can't get in the house.
Bizz.

118
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:51,383
- Are we arm yet?
- Mm-Hm.

119
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:54,104
Getting there.
Might wanna...

120
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,117
think about getting
a dog or something.

121
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,316
No.

122
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:00,864
Here it says you have to input the
security code and then the star key.

123
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,437
- Oh, yeah, smart guy?
- Oh, What was that?

124
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:05,999
Same thing happened to me.
Ain't that weird.

125
00:08:06,024 --> 00:08:08,011
It's not even winter.

126
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:12,900
And they found this house.
They ate it all up.

127
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,603
What are you doing?

128
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,597
Playing.

129
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:20,759
Do you want
to see a trick?

130
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,034
What kind of trick?

131
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:40,984
No way.

132
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:43,466
How are you doing that?

133
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,497
Heh-heh-heh...

134
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:49,180
You try.

135
00:09:01,672 --> 00:09:03,862
Heh-heh-heh...

136
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,440
You look ridiculous.

137
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:12,217
The hair.

138
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:24,453
Why do I have
to be up here?

139
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:28,168
Because this is
the coolest room.

140
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,145
And you're the
coolest kid in the house.

141
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,347
But I don't like the ceiling.

142
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,666
Okay. Now you're just
being silly, come on.

143
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,880
Now. Who's my superboy?
- Mom...

144
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:46,428
I'm sorry.
Are you too big to say it now?

145
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:49,684
- No.
- Then who's my superboy?

146
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,190
- I am.
- Yeah. You are.

147
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,449
- I love you.
- I love you too.

148
00:09:57,474 --> 00:10:00,082
Now get some sleep, okay?

149
00:10:14,016 --> 00:10:17,037
The nightlight!
Nightlight!

150
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:20,378
Sorry, sorry. Sorry...
Okay, okay, okay?

151
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,363
Is that better?

152
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:25,679
Griffin, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

153
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:27,517
Okay.

154
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,343
- Good night, buddy.
- Good night.

155
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:35,539
I had to do something.

156
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:38,091
This place is like a
complete shit hole.

157
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,225
I mean there's
not even any malls,

158
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,555
like the malls are
all boarded up.

159
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,612
Oh my god.
That actually sounds really sad.

160
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:44,810
So, your dad get sacked.

161
00:10:44,835 --> 00:10:46,324
Dude, dude, dude.

162
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,962
<I>Oh yea.
I love that show.</I>

163
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,192
Yeah.

164
00:10:52,217 --> 00:10:55,299
Oh my god.
That guy is a total freak.

165
00:10:57,258 --> 00:11:01,981
I'm Carrigan Burke
and I'm here to clean house.

166
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,832
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I love it when he's like

167
00:11:03,858 --> 00:11:05,976
Okay, ready.
"This house...

168
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:07,680
- is cleaned."
- Is cleaned.

169
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:09,983
Hey, hey, hey.
Can you turn that down?

170
00:11:10,008 --> 00:11:11,089
Uh, come in?

171
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:13,194
Kids are going to sleep.

172
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,823
Hi, Lauren.

173
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,984
Hey, Mrs. Bowen.

174
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,764
Thank you, goodnight.

175
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,042
- Heh-ha-ha...
- Mrs. Bowen?

176
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:32,673
What is Griff
freaking out about?

177
00:11:32,698 --> 00:11:34,170
- The nightlight.
- And.

178
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:35,839
The nightlight.
The nightlight.

179
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:37,764
I don't know
what it is with him.

180
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:39,458
Yeah, well.
We got too many kids.

181
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:43,435
I know. I said we should
have stopped at 2.

182
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,845
- Well. Maddie's not the problem.
- Not yet.

183
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,412
Here's to the little jerks.

184
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,711
Do you think we should
take him to a shrink?

185
00:11:53,736 --> 00:11:55,239
No.

186
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:56,569
He's fine.

187
00:11:56,594 --> 00:12:00,111
He's not fine. It's because
I lost him in that mall. Eh.

188
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,544
Baby.

189
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:04,776
That was 3 years ago. And you
were more freaked out than he was.

190
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:07,107
Some kids are just nervous.
You know.

191
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:08,628
My brother was the same way.

192
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,942
- Yeah, Now he lives alone in a trailer park.
- He doesn't live alone.

193
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:13,154
- Yes, he does.
- He has got like 20 cockatoos.

194
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:16,559
You are not making
me feel better.

195
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:41,331
Maybe you could coach?

196
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:45,160
- What? High school?
- Yeah. Could be a fun thing.

197
00:13:45,185 --> 00:13:46,548
I mean you'll be happy.

198
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:48,453
And be hungry.
We'll all be.

199
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:52,368
Can't support a family
coaching high school.

200
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,825
I should go back to work.

201
00:13:54,855 --> 00:13:58,033
Again with that, come on.
You don't want to do that.

202
00:13:58,067 --> 00:13:59,672
You leave me alone
with these monsters.

203
00:13:59,697 --> 00:14:01,656
My, I need new underwear.
Look at these.

204
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:02,964
These are sad.

205
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:06,969
- Your underwear is sad?
- Yes, my underwear is sad.

206
00:14:06,994 --> 00:14:10,954
Oh. My are very happy right now.
So get over here.

207
00:14:11,274 --> 00:14:12,860
Serious.

208
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,044
We can't keep holding up for
something on your old salary.

209
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,172
I think we're holding up.

210
00:14:18,197 --> 00:14:20,019
Why can't I just
look for something?

211
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:21,923
Because we agreed I would work,
so you can write your book.

212
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,141
That's what we agreed about.

213
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,162
I'm not writing my book.

214
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:27,799
You will. When the
kids go back to school.

215
00:14:27,824 --> 00:14:29,918
Don't put this on my kids
This is on me.

216
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:32,833
Hey. I'm gonna
find something. Okay.

217
00:14:32,858 --> 00:14:34,145
You got to trust me.

218
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,731
We got that dinner party
tomorrow night.

219
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:39,991
You love parties.
I've watched you drink Bourbon.

220
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:43,016
'Course it's gonna be such a drag.
We don't even know those people.

221
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,576
Yeah, but Gary knows him.
He says the husband might be hiring.

222
00:14:45,601 --> 00:14:46,968
Oh yeah.

223
00:14:46,993 --> 00:14:50,192
Maybe our luck is about to change.
Aren't you feeling lucky?

224
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:53,144
- Nm-nm.
- I think things are... looking up.

225
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:55,850
You're such a dork.

226
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:59,427
I'm a dork?
I'm a dork?

227
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,357
- You and your sad underwear.
- Take your pants off.

228
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,817
Yes ma'am.

229
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:05,664
- Really?
- Yeah.

230
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,845
- Wow.
- Take it off.

231
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,492
- Alright.
- Eh-heh-heh...

232
00:15:09,536 --> 00:15:10,936
- Dad.
- Yes!

233
00:15:10,961 --> 00:15:12,463
Hey!

234
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:15,152
- What's up, buddy?
- There's something upstairs.

235
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,014
I think there's something
in my room.

236
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,121
I'll... I'll be up there
in a second.

237
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:20,614
So much for my luck.

238
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:22,026
- Don't move, be right back.
- Okay.

239
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,936
- Think dirty thoughts.
- Mm-Mm.

240
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:27,334
Okay. What is it, buddy?
Was it something in the attic?

241
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:33,256
Houses make noises at night.
It's normal, I promise.

242
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:36,102
Not our old house.

243
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,812
Well. That's true.

244
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,131
Hey, why don't you
tell me what you heard.

245
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,908
Where does all these
clowns come from?

246
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:52,389
I found them in there.

247
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:56,742
Why would somebody
have a box of clowns?

248
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,078
People collect weird things, pal.

249
00:15:59,103 --> 00:16:01,179
I don't like it up here.

250
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:05,685
What's the matter? You scared?
What are you scared of?

251
00:16:06,084 --> 00:16:08,469
Everything.

252
00:16:10,663 --> 00:16:14,838
You got to get over that.
You gotta try to worry less, kiddo.

253
00:16:14,863 --> 00:16:16,246
You know.

254
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:19,888
If you're scared all the time,
Maddie gonna get scared.

255
00:16:20,865 --> 00:16:23,206
You got to set a good example.
You're the big brother. Be brave.

256
00:16:23,231 --> 00:16:26,111
You got to be
brave. You know.

257
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:28,470
Oh shit!

258
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:29,996
- Dad!
- Hah!

259
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,242
What is it?

260
00:16:31,267 --> 00:16:32,275
Hah!

261
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,131
Talk to me.

262
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,696
Why you linger here?

263
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:40,070
Use me, I can release you.
Use me.

264
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:47,270
- What's going on?
- I do not know.

265
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:53,505
Eric. What is going on up there?

266
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,513
What, what.
What, what?

267
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,126
We have a squirrel.

268
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,912
You are such a nut ball.

269
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:12,092
- Big, fuzzy, tail, terrible.
- You scared us.

270
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,444
Perfect.
Rodents.

271
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,739
Let's set a trap tomorrow.

272
00:17:17,764 --> 00:17:19,524
After you catch it
with the trap.

273
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:22,151
Will you release it
to the woods.

274
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:23,976
Yeah sure.

275
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,069
- Would that make you feel better, honey?
- Mm-Hm.

276
00:17:26,094 --> 00:17:29,059
I'm not sleeping up
there until it's gone.

277
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:38,258
Who else is there with you?

278
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:46,490
Can Griffin come too?

279
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:55,166
Yes, I do mean free.

280
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:01,874
I have to ask my mommy.

281
00:20:16,364 --> 00:20:17,948
No.

282
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:22,088
I'm not afraid.

283
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,380
Yes.

284
00:20:26,251 --> 00:20:29,912
But.
How will you get here?

285
00:20:37,546 --> 00:20:40,024
Maddie, what's going on?

286
00:20:41,463 --> 00:20:44,053
They are coming.

287
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:47,347
Who is?
Who is coming?

288
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:02,251
Maddie, get away from the TV!

289
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:14,815
What is going on?

290
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:23,506
They are here.

291
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:46,548
It says here it's probably just a loose
conductor on the electrical power.

292
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,151
Yeah, well. I'm calling an electrician.

293
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,089
Oh what're you going to pay
him for when I can do it myself.

294
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,475
Those guys charge normally like a...
Griff will me, right buddy?

295
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:55,199
- Griff will help you fix an electrical panel?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:55,224 --> 00:21:58,007
I found out where the
squirrel got in by the way.

297
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,040
- There's a hole by the the roof line.
- Uh-huh.

298
00:22:00,065 --> 00:22:02,186
- Dad, I don't want cereal, I want pizza.
- I'm gonna blocked it up.

299
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:04,787
- Yeah! For breakfast?
- For all the timer.

300
00:22:04,797 --> 00:22:05,934
3 times a day.

301
00:22:05,959 --> 00:22:08,155
Griffin, I told you
not to touch my phone.

302
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:10,322
- I didn't touch your phone.
- Then why is it fried?

303
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:13,200
- How do I know
- Here we go.

304
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:14,576
I need a new phone.

305
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:16,462
- Oh. You do, huh.
- No more. No more phones, honey.

306
00:22:16,487 --> 00:22:19,196
This isn't a luxury item, dad.
I mean, it's a necessity.

307
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,277
What if you need to
reach me in an emergency?

308
00:22:21,302 --> 00:22:23,414
- We can't afford it, honey.
- That's bullshit.

309
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:25,315
- Kendra.
- Hey, why are you being so selfish about.

310
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,024
- That's bullshit!
- Hey, Maddie.

311
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:29,343
If you want a new phone,
you can get a part time job.

312
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:31,005
I'll get a job when
you get a job

313
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,093
- Hey! Hey! She has a job.
- Excuse me?

314
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,595
You kids are her job.

315
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,661
Oh.

316
00:22:36,686 --> 00:22:38,413
Which I apparently suck at it.

317
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:42,339
- I don't think you suck at it.
- Thank you sweetheart.

318
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:49,348
Hey Maddie. Do you
remember last night?

319
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:52,724
- When you said, they are here.
- Uh-huh.

320
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,224
What did you mean?

321
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,519
- Who is here?
- Just my friends.

322
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,093
Yeah.
Your pretend friends?

323
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:07,777
No, they are lost people.
They are not pretend, mommy.

324
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:15,490
Girl's going to put
me in a hole, man.

325
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:17,683
She's grounded.

326
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:20,541
Judge Bowen has spoken.
For at least 24 hours.

327
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,910
Remind her, she's babysitting
tonight. Will you.

328
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:26,189
I hate it Kendra babysits.
- So does she, pal.

329
00:23:26,199 --> 00:23:28,886
I think I might make us
some squirrel traps.

330
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:30,609
Yeah, that's a good idea.

331
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:33,292
What is this?

332
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,691
- Oh, Griffin. Put that down.
- What is that?

333
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:36,480
- Put that down.
- Is that a bone or something?

334
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:38,475
- Yes. Put that down.
- Let me see.

335
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,817
This is a buried pet or something.
Maybe it's a horse.

336
00:23:40,842 --> 00:23:43,183
Maybe it's a.
Maybe it's a pig too.

337
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,026
- A Pig.
- This thing freaking you out.

338
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:46,577
- Stop.
- What's the matter?

339
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:47,786
Stop.
Stop.

340
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:50,030
Alright.
Put that back.

341
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,685
Yeah, that's not going through.

342
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,759
I'm sorry about that. My wife said
she might cancel one of the cards

343
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:59,722
because we don't need them all.
I didn't know she did it.

344
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:02,249
It's not canceled,
it's over the limit.

345
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,691
- Is that what is says there?
- Yup.

346
00:24:05,547 --> 00:24:07,975
Okay, let's try this one.

347
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:12,060
Ms. Apron.
Are you in the Union?

348
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:15,194
You have a good
pension here for this...

349
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:21,338
- Sorry. This one is... canceled too.
- Yeah.

350
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,943
Strike 2, huh.
Alright.

351
00:24:24,968 --> 00:24:28,473
- Hey. Third one's the charm.
- Fingers crossed.

352
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,996
How're doing?
Are we good?

353
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:40,392
- Yeah. Yeah, you're good.
- Love that sound. Okay.

354
00:24:59,902 --> 00:25:01,231
Aw.
Damn it.

355
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:04,704
Griffin.
I asked you to bring these comic

356
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:06,625
- books upstairs.
- I was just about to do it.

357
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,454
Yeah. I almost broke my neck.

358
00:25:08,479 --> 00:25:11,825
Because you were walking and playing
that games at the same time I bet.

359
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,910
Thank you.

360
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,616
Maddie.

361
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:39,870
Is that you?

362
00:25:43,664 --> 00:25:45,538
Maddie?

363
00:25:58,436 --> 00:26:00,191
Maddie.

364
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:02,686
This isn't funny.

365
00:27:08,067 --> 00:27:10,514
All right, everybody.
Come downstairs.

366
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,271
- Come on, family meeting.
- Dad! Dad!

367
00:27:12,281 --> 00:27:14,858
- Dad! I have to tell you something.
- Let's go. Kendra, come down here.

368
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,392
Hey baby. What's going on
with the flowers out there?

369
00:27:16,417 --> 00:27:18,090
I don't know.
Did you get pizza?

370
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,598
- I just made Chicken Nuggets.
- It's okay, we'll have both.

371
00:27:20,623 --> 00:27:22,114
Pizza.
- Get everyone a pizza

372
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:23,988
- you put them together you got Chicken Nugget Pizza.
- Dad!

373
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:26,357
- Sounds good right.
- Dad, the weirdest thing happened!

374
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,186
Oh yeah. Why are you screaming
at me, Griffin? You're screaming.

375
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:30,721
- What?
- What? What?

376
00:27:30,746 --> 00:27:32,871
Here's what.
Huh.

377
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,197
- What's that?
- Look at that.

378
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:35,512
- No way.
- Yeah way.

379
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:36,967
- You know what else?
- Now get off my back.

380
00:27:36,992 --> 00:27:38,402
- Thank you, daddy.
- You got it.

381
00:27:38,427 --> 00:27:40,004
- Dad! And guess what?
- Yeah.

382
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,605
- The ball rolled across the floor
- What? What?

383
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,686
- Knocked into the closet and
- Hey look at this.

384
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:45,840
- Got you that AR drone you wanted.

385
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,640
- Look at that, ain't it cool.
- Dad! You're not listening to me.

386
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:48,785
It has a camera on it.

387
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,220
- It does?
- What are you doing?

388
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,892
What are you doing, kidding?

389
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:53,829
Look at that.
These are the ones you like.

390
00:27:53,854 --> 00:27:55,268
To wear them to
the party tonight.

391
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:57,462
Dad, that's not all. There was
this tower of comic books formed.

392
00:27:57,487 --> 00:27:59,776
When I turned around,
they blew back at my face.

393
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:01,317
They have just appeared out of no where.
- Oh wow.

394
00:28:01,342 --> 00:28:03,257
- And make them all.
- Really? That's crazy.

395
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,480
- It's not funny, Dad.
- Yes. Hilarious.

396
00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,614
How did you pay this?

397
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:10,229
What. How do you think.
I stole it. Robbed a bank.

398
00:28:10,276 --> 00:28:13,224
- Uh oh.
- Oh oh. Daddyo.

399
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:15,569
We gotta bring this set back.
You have to take it back.

400
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,034
- Mom. No. Mom.
- We're not bringing anything back.

401
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:19,583
- Griffin.
- I think we deserve a treat.

402
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:22,413
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

403
00:28:22,423 --> 00:28:26,030
Griffin, gosh! It's been
all afternoon with this.

404
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:29,286
Just so you know, I putting a pass code
on my phone. So you can't get to it.

405
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,339
- Please don't antagonize him.
- Dad, we have to move.

406
00:28:31,371 --> 00:28:33,413
We're not moving.
Now quit it

407
00:28:33,438 --> 00:28:34,904
- Amy.
- No, I expect this from Maddie.

408
00:28:34,936 --> 00:28:37,776
But I'm starting to think
he's the baby in the family.

409
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:43,312
- Hey you go, mommy.
- Thank you sweetheart.

410
00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:46,871
- Griffin, I'm sorry.
- Everything didn't go well as I hope.

411
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:48,759
- How's the pizza? Yeah.
- Mm...

412
00:28:48,784 --> 00:28:50,726
- No good.
- Yeah.

413
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:52,575
No.

414
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:58,125
Alright, you need to just try with
the nuggets. It's a little better.

415
00:29:07,882 --> 00:29:10,104
- Daddy. Break my arm. Break my arm.
- Okay. Okay.

416
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,482
- Now my neck! Neck! Neck!
- Dad.

417
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,164
Dad, what if the
squirrel gets in?

418
00:29:14,189 --> 00:29:16,346
I've sealed up the hole.
It's tighter than Fort Knox up there.

419
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:18,107
- Bye bye, daddy.
- Then why did you leave the trap?

420
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:21,625
Insurance, you can't be too safe.
Squirrels are wildlly smart.

421
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,705
- Okay. Bye, bye, bye...
- Okay. Don't worry about it.

422
00:29:23,802 --> 00:29:25,519
- Set the alarm. Call us if you need us.
- I will.

423
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:27,250
- Call you on my new phone.
- Yeah you will.

424
00:29:27,275 --> 00:29:28,725
- Okay. Be good to your sister.
- Bye mommy.

425
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,084
- Lock the door.
- I will. Bye. Bye.

426
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:35,153
I want to stay up all night!
- No. Maddison, no. Go upstairs.

427
00:29:35,178 --> 00:29:36,667
No!

428
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,968
Alright.

429
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,346
Wait, wait.

430
00:29:40,371 --> 00:29:43,355
Piggycorn says she
wants more kisses.

431
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,046
- She does, huh?
- Uh-huh.

432
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,903
- How many?
- Uh-huh.

433
00:29:46,935 --> 00:29:49,219
- She says 3.
- 3.

434
00:29:49,244 --> 00:29:50,145
- 3.
- Sure?

435
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,878
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

436
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:53,011
- 1.
- 1.

437
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:54,306
- 2.
- 2.

438
00:29:54,331 --> 00:29:55,226
- 3.
- 3.

439
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,421
20.
I love you.

440
00:29:57,446 --> 00:29:59,791
I can't fall sleep.

441
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,948
Why not?

442
00:30:02,118 --> 00:30:05,089
I think there's a storm coming.

443
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,175
Eric tells me you played ball together in college.
Said you had quite a swing.

444
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,357
Oh, triple A. But I still do
swing with the best of them.

445
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:14,605
Don't get any ideas, Barbara.

446
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,111
He could have played in the Mayors,
he's been very modest.

447
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:21,774
I had a bad shoulder,
so it wasn't meant to be.

448
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,392
Well. Lucky you had a
plan B to fall back on.

449
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,139
Nothing wrong with suit and tie.

450
00:30:26,164 --> 00:30:28,869
I keep telling my son.
It pays the rent.

451
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,558
It's a good thing I have
a suit and tie then,

452
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:32,212
I can put them on
Monday morning, if you like.

453
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:33,902
What time do I start?
9.

454
00:30:33,926 --> 00:30:35,312
They just moved
to Willow Point.

455
00:30:35,337 --> 00:30:38,344
My brother had a house in that
development back in the 90s.

456
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,715
We've never visit him because
of the cemetery thing.

457
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,851
The thought of it
just give me the willies.

458
00:30:42,876 --> 00:30:44,929
- What cemetery thing?
- Just that.

459
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:47,314
That development was
built on a former cemetery.

460
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,185
- But they moved it though.
- Yeah.

461
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,513
The developers relocated the
whole thing to Bronson Park.

462
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:55,316
200 hectares.
This was years ago.

463
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,740
You can't mean they
moved the whole cemetery?

464
00:30:57,765 --> 00:31:02,040
- The realtor didn't mention it?
- No. Actually, they didn't mention it.

465
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,691
Just like, you know. Very uncool.
They like to move all those bodies and.

466
00:31:06,716 --> 00:31:09,986
Well. It's not like it was an
ancient tribal burial ground.

467
00:31:10,011 --> 00:31:13,544
It's just 10 minutes away. I mean,
people can still visit loved ones.

468
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:16,005
But now it's in
a nicer neighborhood.

469
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,962
Oh, I'm sorry.

470
00:33:19,837 --> 00:33:23,623
There is nothing to be afraid of.
There is nothing to be afraid of.

471
00:33:23,648 --> 00:33:27,909
There is nothing to be afraid of.
There is nothing to be afraid of.

472
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:32,203
HELP!
PLEASE HELP!

473
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:06,923
Kendra!

474
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:11,479
Maddie.

475
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,114
We're gonna get
into big trouble.

476
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:30,567
Griffin?

477
00:37:32,441 --> 00:37:33,814
Griffin?

478
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,186
I'm scared.

479
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,962
Just stay away from the closet.

480
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:39,409
Don't leave me!

481
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,038
Kendra!

482
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,507
Kendra!

483
00:37:45,532 --> 00:37:47,682
Aww!

484
00:37:49,488 --> 00:37:51,442
Dad!

485
00:37:55,716 --> 00:38:00,178
DAD!

486
00:38:02,005 --> 00:38:05,689
(Dad... Dad...)

487
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:17,678
What the hell is that?

488
00:40:17,703 --> 00:40:18,976
Alright stop.

489
00:40:19,681 --> 00:40:21,305
- Stop the car.
- Why?

490
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,303
Stop the car.

491
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:26,010
Help me!

492
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:28,555
Aw!

493
00:40:29,586 --> 00:40:31,221
Somebody help!

494
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:32,484
Griff?

495
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:33,870
Help!
Help!

496
00:40:33,895 --> 00:40:35,207
Griffin.

497
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,705
Oh my god.
Griff.

498
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:38,455
Are you alright?

499
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,008
Okay baby.
Okay baby.

500
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,188
What the hell is going on?

501
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:43,262
Mom!

502
00:40:43,287 --> 00:40:45,104
- Dad. Mom. Dad.
- What... What's going on?

503
00:40:45,129 --> 00:40:47,175
The basement.
I got locked in the basement.

504
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,239
Slow down. Slow down, I cannot..

505
00:40:49,264 --> 00:40:52,235
- What? What did you say?
- I can't find Maddie.

506
00:41:03,164 --> 00:41:05,080
Madison?

507
00:41:05,814 --> 00:41:07,473
Where are you, Maddie?

508
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:33,273
<font color="#91b6df"><i>Mom?</i></font>

509
00:41:40,048 --> 00:41:41,040
Madison?

510
00:41:41,065 --> 00:41:42,474

<font color="#95bdee">Mom.</font>

512
00:41:51,171 --> 00:41:52,452
Mom.

513
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:54,527
Mom.

514
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:56,708
Mom!

515
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:57,873
Mom!

516
00:41:57,898 --> 00:41:59,109
Griff?

517
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:00,471
Griff.

518
00:42:02,065 --> 00:42:03,066
<font color="#95bdee">Mom.</font>

519
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:04,538
<font color="#95bdee">Mommy?</font>

520
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:08,154
<font color="#95bdee">Mom.</font>

521
00:42:09,646 --> 00:42:11,544
Maddie, where are you?

522
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:21,205
<font color="#95bdee">Mommy.
Mommy.</font>

523
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:28,466
<font color="#95bdee"><i>Daddy, is that you?</i></font>

524
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:38,528
- We don't even know what happened.
- I know but we have to tell them.

525
00:42:38,553 --> 00:42:40,380
- We got to figure out what happened. Okay.
- We have to call them.

526
00:42:40,405 --> 00:42:42,076
We can't call the cops.

527
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:43,462
What're you going to tell them?

528
00:42:43,487 --> 00:42:45,712
That our daughter got, I don't know what just
happened there. - I'm gonna tell them that.

529
00:42:45,737 --> 00:42:48,757
We need to figure out
what's going on. Okay.

530
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,523
Listen.
Listen to me.

531
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:52,462
If you call the cops,
they're going to blame us.

532
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,769
No, they're not going to blame us.
We're just gonna tell them what happened.

533
00:42:54,794 --> 00:42:57,983
We're just gonna tell them the truth.
I'm going to tell them the truth.

534
00:42:58,008 --> 00:42:59,137
I'm going to tell them the truth.

535
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,874
We're going to tell the truth together.

536
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:02,638
I'm going to tell them the
truth of what happened.

537
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,813
I wanted hope.

538
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:05,345
We don't know what the truth is, honey.

539
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,299
- We don't know what the truth is.
- Eric, we have to call someone.

540
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:14,100
There's got to be somebody
who is going to believe us.

541
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,681
<B>DEPT. PARANORMAL
RESEARCH</ b>

542
00:43:18,843 --> 00:43:22,948
Griffin was the first one
to notice things, noises.

543
00:43:23,856 --> 00:43:25,599
Things.

544
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:29,808
I thought he was making it up.

545
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:32,193
Sorry, buddy.

546
00:43:33,015 --> 00:43:34,593
We didn't know
where else to go.

547
00:43:34,594 --> 00:43:36,583
No. You did the right
thing coming here.

548
00:43:36,608 --> 00:43:40,974
When I was a student here,
This office has the craziest reputation.

549
00:43:40,999 --> 00:43:43,590
I think we still do.
Um.

550
00:43:43,615 --> 00:43:45,089
May I ask where
your husband is?

551
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:49,701
He's at home with Kendra, our oldest.
We don't want to leave Maddie alone.

552
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:53,414
The last time you had contact with her
was after she disappeared?

553
00:43:53,439 --> 00:43:56,072
Just the one time.
Uh.

554
00:43:56,097 --> 00:43:59,698
Through the television set. I'm sorry.
I hear how crazy this sounds?

555
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:01,362
I know I must sound ridiculous.

556
00:44:01,387 --> 00:44:04,204
No. No, it doesn't.
It doesn't sound crazy at all.

557
00:44:04,229 --> 00:44:05,880
- It's my fault.
- No, it is not.

558
00:44:05,905 --> 00:44:09,397
Look at me. Look at me
It's not your fault.

559
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:12,410
Why... Why do you think
it's your fault?

560
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:16,845
I left her alone.
I knew I shouldn't have.

561
00:44:16,883 --> 00:44:18,969
But I was scared.

562
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:22,709
Of course.
Of course you were scared.

563
00:44:22,734 --> 00:44:27,656
You have to get my sister back.
You have to.

564
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:30,519
Can you do that?

565
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:34,235
I can try.

566
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,343
That's the uh.

567
00:44:52,368 --> 00:44:56,930
TV where Maddie's
hands were on.

568
00:44:57,666 --> 00:45:03,747
This is the staircase that Griffin
was first grabbed by the trees.

569
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:04,995
Aw!

570
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:06,938
And then, there's that.
That slob shocker.

571
00:45:06,963 --> 00:45:08,678
You guys want some
sandwiches or something?

572
00:45:08,703 --> 00:45:11,086
- It won't be necessary.
- I'm going to start recording, is that cool?

573
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:14,170
Yeah.
Knock yourself out.

574
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:21,626
That's solid wall. I poked and
probed it about 100 times.

575
00:45:22,421 --> 00:45:25,484
You think she got pulled
through there somehow?

576
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:27,656
We don't know.

577
00:45:27,681 --> 00:45:30,370
What do you think.
It's like a magical portal?

578
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:32,433
I just said we don't know.

579
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:35,491
Hey. Would you mind if I hold on to that?
I just, till she gets back.

580
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:38,285
I don't want it, you know.
Lost in the shuffle.

581
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,477
No. No problem.

582
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:48,102
You know I shot a pretty amazing
occurrence recently.

583
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:50,123
We were at this an old
house in Naperville and,

584
00:45:50,148 --> 00:45:55,419
a piano bench rolled 10 feet
across the parlor floor.

585
00:45:55,444 --> 00:45:57,627
It took seven hours.

586
00:45:57,652 --> 00:45:59,492
- To roll 10 feet?
- Yeah.

587
00:45:59,517 --> 00:46:03,600
But I used this special time-lapse
setting on my camera

588
00:46:03,625 --> 00:46:06,503
so...
nailed the whole thing.

589
00:46:06,528 --> 00:46:09,663
You can't catch that kind of a thing
with the naked eye so I...

590
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,779
Did you get all that on your
time-lapse camera?

591
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:30,124
From my experience, this doesn't
seem to be a classic haunting.

592
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:36,641
What you have here is probably
closer to a poltergeist intrusion.

593
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:38,186
What is the difference?

594
00:46:38,211 --> 00:46:43,249
Ghost usual appears as harmless
apparition whereas poltergeist ...

595
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:48,605
They are noisy, they lash out,
they are violent, they move objects.

596
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,859
It comes, and it can
just suddenly go away.

597
00:46:53,884 --> 00:46:56,467
And take Maddie with it?

598
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:51,210
- You okay?
- Yeah.

599
00:47:51,647 --> 00:47:53,621
Yeah. What's going on?

600
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:57,475
Should have been me.

601
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,439
Home, you know.

602
00:47:59,464 --> 00:48:01,620
- Should have been home.
- Don't do this, okay. Okay.

603
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:03,821
I can't lose you now.

604
00:48:03,953 --> 00:48:09,778
If I say: It's not gonna be okay.
You have to say: Of course it is, sweetheart.

605
00:48:11,446 --> 00:48:14,423
Otherwise we're not
going to get through this.

606
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:31,295
We've done a scan of the house.
And now we're, we're wiring into you system

607
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,236
so if Maddie tries to
make contact again,

608
00:48:33,261 --> 00:48:35,520
we will be able to have a better
sense of what's going on

609
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,507
which may help us get her back.
Is that sound okay?

610
00:48:38,532 --> 00:48:41,560
That sounds great.
Can we do it a little faster?

611
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:43,714
Watch it.

612
00:48:46,163 --> 00:48:48,752
Hey, let me ask you something?

613
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:51,099
Your dad.

614
00:48:51,356 --> 00:48:54,193
He's been out of work a while.
Right?

615
00:48:54,218 --> 00:48:56,898
Yeah, I guess.

616
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:01,268
That's okay.
Nobody's perfect.

617
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:04,145
I was just thinking about it.

618
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:07,252
You know If you really want
to make some money quick.

619
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,791
A poltergeist abduction
isn't a bad idea.

620
00:49:10,816 --> 00:49:13,245
Even if it turn out to be a fake

621
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,345
You know you go public with it.
You do some TV appearances.

622
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,744
- You get your own reality show.
- Would you stop

623
00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:20,643
How cool would that be?

624
00:49:20,668 --> 00:49:25,807
We don't want a reality show.
We just want to Maddie back.

625
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:34,000
You're good, kid.
Very good.

626
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:37,558
Did you set up the heat sensor
in the back of the closet yet?

627
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:41,593
No, not yet. I didn't uh,
didn't know how to fasten that thing.

628
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:44,587
Screw it, Boyd.

629
00:49:45,745 --> 00:49:50,098
Okay.
Captain.

630
00:50:00,187 --> 00:50:01,937
Screw it.

631
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:43,689
Damn.

632
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:24,427
Gotcha.

633
00:53:30,336 --> 00:53:32,948
You all done up there?

634
00:53:32,973 --> 00:53:34,048
Yeah.

635
00:53:34,073 --> 00:53:36,754
The heat sensors in the closet?

636
00:53:39,622 --> 00:53:40,877
Sort of.

637
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:44,763
Boyd. I really need you
to take this more seriously. Okay?

638
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,221
- Okay?
- Okay.

639
00:53:46,246 --> 00:53:48,511
Okay.
Good.

640
00:53:49,868 --> 00:53:51,785
What I think
what I was saying is...

641
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,566
some people believe there are
different levels of reality.

642
00:53:54,591 --> 00:53:56,139
We're on a physical plane.

643
00:53:56,154 --> 00:53:58,929
But when we die,
our spirits go to uh,

644
00:53:58,954 --> 00:54:03,079
Another level.
An astro plane or spiritual plane.

645
00:54:03,104 --> 00:54:08,154
Which is sort of here and
not here at the same time.

646
00:54:09,619 --> 00:54:10,999
Okay.

647
00:54:12,198 --> 00:54:14,202
Look at this.

648
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:21,046
Like this.

649
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:25,429
Thank you, Dr. Powell.
Is us, here. On the physical level.

650
00:54:26,105 --> 00:54:31,084
And some how
Maddie got pulled... here.

651
00:54:32,253 --> 00:54:35,454
Here and not here
at the same time.

652
00:54:35,479 --> 00:54:37,569
Exactly.

653
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:43,657
Then someone should go in there
and show her the way back here.

654
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,260
That's actually not a bad idea.

655
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:56,315
I'm fairly certain that Maddie is able to
hear us a lot better than we can hear her.

656
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:59,235
So this equipment is going to ...

657
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,745
filter out all the interference,

658
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:05,109
so that we'll be better able
to communicate with her.

659
00:55:05,134 --> 00:55:07,249
How do we start?

660
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:11,756
You just call out to her.

661
00:55:12,908 --> 00:55:14,574
Okay

662
00:55:17,179 --> 00:55:18,635
Yeah.

663
00:55:19,697 --> 00:55:21,835
Maddie?

664
00:55:24,842 --> 00:55:27,534
Madison, it's mommy.

665
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:30,768
Can you hear me?

666
00:55:30,793 --> 00:55:33,842
Madison, we want to talk to you.

667
00:55:34,183 --> 00:55:37,639
We just want you to let us
know that you're safe.

668
00:55:41,318 --> 00:55:43,659
Are you with us?

669
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:48,046
Maddie, we need to hear your voice, okay sweetheart.

670
00:55:48,071 --> 00:55:51,069
Can you say hello to Mommy?

671
00:55:58,054 --> 00:56:00,400
Are you with us?

672
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:03,333
We all miss you very much.

673
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:14,229
Mommy misses you
so, so, so... much.

674
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:17,395
<font color="#8cc6f4">Mom.</font>

675
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:19,659
<font color="#8cc6f4">Mommy.</font>

676
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,055
Oh, hey baby.

677
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,246
Hey honey, Daddy's here too.
We're all waiting for you, honey.

678
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:27,446
Daddy, where are you?

679
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:30,768
We're home, we need you to
come back to us now honey.

680
00:56:30,793 --> 00:56:35,030
I tried,
but I can't find you.

681
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,035
Okay, okay, okay.
Well, keep on trying.

682
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,612
Okay, because we are right here.
Okay, you're so close.

683
00:56:41,637 --> 00:56:43,658
Mommy.

684
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:47,615
Mommy, Daddy.
Is that you?

685
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:48,767
No.
Daddy is right here, honey.

686
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:50,183
There's somebody with her.

687
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,685
- Who is with you, baby?
- Daddy's right here, honey.

688
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,263
Who is with you?

689
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,405
They are all around me ...

690
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,560
Mom.
Look out.

691
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:04,902
Maddie!
Maddie!

692
00:57:10,005 --> 00:57:12,529
- Maddie, can you hear us?
- What's going on with the lights?

693
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:16,707
Mommy.
Mommy.

694
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,353
- Daddy?
- Maddie?

695
00:57:20,535 --> 00:57:22,187
Madison

696
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:26,870
Daddy, I'm scared.

697
00:57:31,161 --> 00:57:32,378
Maddie

698
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,321
- No. Wait, wait, wait...
- Mr Bowen, no! Mr Bowen, no!

699
00:58:30,524 --> 00:58:33,108
Maddie. It's me, honey.

700
00:58:49,457 --> 00:58:52,501
Give her back!
Give her back!

701
00:58:53,256 --> 00:58:56,019
Give her back!
Can't have her!

702
00:58:57,279 --> 00:59:01,093
Can't have her!
Can't have her!

703
00:59:27,195 --> 00:59:29,588
You okay?
Did you get hit?

704
00:59:29,613 --> 00:59:31,302
No. You okay?
Everything okay?

705
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:33,436
What is that?

706
00:59:33,477 --> 00:59:35,699
- Eric?
- Eric.

707
00:59:35,724 --> 00:59:37,432
What happened?

708
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:45,570
That, Mr. Bowen.
That's Maddie's way out.

709
00:59:47,622 --> 00:59:50,389
But I think we're gonna need
some help in getting her there.

710
00:59:50,409 --> 00:59:52,526
What kind of help?

711
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:55,357
Have you ever heard
of Carrigan Burke?

712
00:59:56,562 --> 01:00:00,612
No F you way.

713
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:52,824
What happened to your hand?

714
01:00:53,056 --> 01:00:56,820
Blanchard, Michigan, '97.

715
01:00:57,271 --> 01:01:01,496
Found a root basement,
spirit didn't want to leave.

716
01:01:02,647 --> 01:01:07,157
- Lucky, they're not all that angry.
- Ours is.

717
01:01:07,667 --> 01:01:10,671
- Hey buddy, you okay?
- Yeah. The guy is there.

718
01:01:10,696 --> 01:01:14,708
- You must be the Bowens.
- You must be the cavalry.

719
01:01:16,878 --> 01:01:20,330
- Yeah.
- Dr Powell.

720
01:01:20,806 --> 01:01:24,264
Well. We're all set up if
you want to get started.

721
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:32,548
Hey.
Big fan of.

722
01:01:32,573 --> 01:01:34,421
My name is Boyd.
Nice to meet you.

723
01:01:34,446 --> 01:01:36,271
Here.

724
01:01:40,672 --> 01:01:44,984
- He knows this can't be on TV, right?
- Yeah. I told him that.

725
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:47,290
So why is he doing it?

726
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:50,348
This is the area of bilocation.

727
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:54,342
The table fell out, I was almost crushed.

728
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:58,186
Is everything alright?

729
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:01,070
If it was,
I wouldn't be here.

730
01:02:08,512 --> 01:02:11,604
This house
is not clean.

731
01:02:11,629 --> 01:02:14,626
- Shh.
- What?

732
01:02:35,406 --> 01:02:37,001
Alright

733
01:02:37,026 --> 01:02:38,724
First things first.

734
01:02:38,749 --> 01:02:41,673
I want you to tell me a
little bit about Maddie.

735
01:02:41,698 --> 01:02:45,301
Did you ever feel that she
was uh, a little bit off?

736
01:02:45,326 --> 01:02:48,705
- Off? What do you mean?
- How do you mean. Off?

737
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,387
You know. Have you ever hear her
talking to things that weren't there?

738
01:02:52,407 --> 01:02:56,145
Yeah, but. She has imaginary
friends, but that's normal.

739
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:00,919
I think what he's trying to say is that,
Maddie might had been born with a gift.

740
01:03:00,939 --> 01:03:03,930
That's not the word I use,
but alright.

741
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:07,806
You mean
she can talk to ghosts?

742
01:03:07,929 --> 01:03:09,586
She's 6 years old.

743
01:03:09,606 --> 01:03:12,514
Which means that her
life force is at its purest.

744
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:16,586
Without judgment or cynicism.

745
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:19,102
Why do you think they reach out
to her in the first place.

746
01:03:19,127 --> 01:03:20,872
They didn't reach out
to any of you?

747
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:24,337
You keep saying "they",
where, who, who are "they"?

748
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:30,146
Uh now. Brooke tells me that this
development was built on a cemetery.

749
01:03:31,844 --> 01:03:33,162
- Right?
- Dad, really?

750
01:03:33,187 --> 01:03:35,784
Calm down. It is a
former cemetery. Former.

751
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:38,104
They moved the bodies
a long ago.

752
01:03:38,124 --> 01:03:40,561
- Relocated to.
- Yeah. They moved into a nicer neighborhood.

753
01:03:40,586 --> 01:03:42,657
Now. I don't think
that they are.

754
01:03:42,682 --> 01:03:46,455
I think they just told people
they moved the cemetery and...

755
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,657
I think they just
moved the headstones.

756
01:03:48,682 --> 01:03:51,042
And they left the bodies.

757
01:03:53,274 --> 01:03:54,527
Oh my god.

758
01:03:54,547 --> 01:03:58,887
This isn't just a few pissed-off
spirits that we're dealing with.

759
01:03:58,912 --> 01:04:02,359
This is unlike anything
that I ever felt before.

760
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:04,056
This is.

761
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:07,799
It's more like a mob.
They suffered a terrible injustice...

762
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:15,220
and that, that anger and frustration
has created a more powerful force.

763
01:04:15,245 --> 01:04:17,199
The poltergeist.

764
01:04:17,224 --> 01:04:19,964
They are trapped,
and they are desperate.

765
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:23,897
And your daughter is their
ticket out of this purgatory.

766
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:25,578
What do they want with her?

767
01:04:25,603 --> 01:04:29,178
They want her to be their
lantern in the darkness.

768
01:04:29,404 --> 01:04:31,793
To lead them into the light.

769
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:38,628
What happens if she
goes into the light?

770
01:04:38,653 --> 01:04:41,912
Then there's no getting
her back if she does that.

771
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:48,092
Okay. Just because he said that,
it doesn't mean it's, that's true. Okay.

772
01:04:48,534 --> 01:04:51,066
Hey, nothing you said
makes sense to me.

773
01:04:51,091 --> 01:04:53,416
And everything else does, right?

774
01:04:53,438 --> 01:04:58,109
The closet, the tree, the smoldered hole
in the ceiling. All that makes sense to you.

775
01:04:58,134 --> 01:05:02,656
- But I'm full of crap.
- I don't know, okay? I don't know.

776
01:05:02,809 --> 01:05:07,251
We just want our daughter back. Okay.
We just want our daughter back.

777
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:10,206
Eric. I know exactly
how you feel.

778
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:11,770
- I don't know if you do.
- I felted it

779
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:14,968
every single day of my entire life.

780
01:05:14,993 --> 01:05:19,591
It is hard to know what to believe in,
but I am here to help.

781
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:22,056
You believe that, don't you?

782
01:05:26,446 --> 01:05:28,235
Okay.

783
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:33,207
You're all I've got.
So let's do it.

784
01:05:55,671 --> 01:06:00,461
So. Everybody gets a GPS tracker.
This is going to tell us where you are.

785
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:04,672
Anytime. In case anything
gets, gets weird.

786
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:07,294
What are we suppose
to do with this?

787
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:09,573
Just put it in your pocket.

788
01:06:23,683 --> 01:06:27,249
- Weird, right?
- Yeah.

789
01:06:27,384 --> 01:06:30,774
- Check the leg?
- I don't know.

790
01:06:31,758 --> 01:06:33,936
Can you show me
how to fly this thing?

791
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:35,404
Okay.

792
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:38,521
It's kind of complicated.
Do you want me to fly it?

793
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:41,121
I can handle it.

794
01:06:42,106 --> 01:06:45,931
You can ask me about it,
or just stare at my leg the whole day.

795
01:06:45,956 --> 01:06:48,488
I don't know what
you're talking about.

796
01:06:48,513 --> 01:06:50,556
Let's just get this
over with, shall wet?

797
01:06:50,581 --> 01:06:52,568
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

798
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:55,480
We don't need to
see that, it's weird.

799
01:06:56,033 --> 01:06:57,893
- Ugh, what happened to you?
- Ugh, what happened to you?

800
01:06:57,918 --> 01:06:59,706
Portugal, 2003.

801
01:06:59,731 --> 01:07:04,511
There's a monastery in the forest of
Bussaco with a particularly nasty entity.

802
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:07,182
And, you got rid of it?

803
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:10,099
Not before it took a
piece of my leg with it.

804
01:07:10,124 --> 01:07:11,781
Okay uh, thank you for that.

805
01:07:11,806 --> 01:07:15,121
It's gross, I'm gonna go
throw up. Thanks.

806
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:21,578
And what about that one?

807
01:07:22,485 --> 01:07:24,549
That's a good story.

808
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:28,060
Let's save that for after
this is all over, shall we?

809
01:07:28,086 --> 01:07:30,610
Assuming you don't die.

810
01:07:33,671 --> 01:07:35,832
Okay.

811
01:07:36,793 --> 01:07:39,408
Why do you do that?
- What?

812
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:41,295
You tell him your
old war stories.

813
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,457
You make yourself
sound like an old man.

814
01:07:43,491 --> 01:07:47,091
Comes with the territories.
We aged in dog years.

815
01:07:47,116 --> 01:07:48,852
You have kids, Mr. Burke?

816
01:07:48,877 --> 01:07:50,209
Sadly no.

817
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,237
My wife didn't think it was a
good idea given our line of work.

818
01:07:53,257 --> 01:07:55,400
It wasn't just the work.

819
01:07:55,429 --> 01:07:56,727
Oh.
You...

820
01:07:56,752 --> 01:07:59,323
The... two...
The two of you were...

821
01:07:59,348 --> 01:08:01,563
- Briefly.
- We were young and stupid.

822
01:08:01,588 --> 01:08:04,633
- The only one of us is stupid.
- Don't be so hard on yourself.

823
01:08:04,658 --> 01:08:06,260
I was irresistible, back then.

824
01:08:06,285 --> 01:08:08,286
I'm gonna go check
the readings up stairs.

825
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:10,869
And she goes,
just like she fled our marriage.

826
01:08:10,894 --> 01:08:15,281
Straight into the arms of academia.
Safe, stable academia.

827
01:08:15,306 --> 01:08:17,030
- Still misses me though.
- No, I don't.

828
01:08:17,055 --> 01:08:19,584
- You do, a little.
- No, not even a little bit.

829
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:22,586
She thinks that I can
sense these things.

830
01:08:22,619 --> 01:08:26,925
- I have special powers, you know.
- You're not that special.

831
01:08:28,476 --> 01:08:30,310
You alright?

832
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,724
I'm a little scared.

833
01:08:31,749 --> 01:08:36,793
Yeah. Me too. What are you
going to do about that?

834
01:08:38,269 --> 01:08:42,027
I don't know
Think about Maddie?

835
01:08:42,052 --> 01:08:44,052
Let's try that.

836
01:08:49,402 --> 01:08:53,724
- Feeling less scared?
- No, not in a way.

837
01:08:53,749 --> 01:08:56,221
Yeah, me neither.

838
01:08:57,617 --> 01:09:01,859
- I feel a little braver though.
- Me too.

839
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:05,847
- We're good.
- Brooke, video's up.

840
01:09:05,867 --> 01:09:08,040
- We're all set to go down here.
- Let's go.

841
01:09:08,065 --> 01:09:11,493
Kendra, would you throw me
that belt that's in that bag there?

842
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:13,791
That's it.

843
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:17,145
Alright.
Just so we're all clear.

844
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:21,901
First, we use the rope to bridge
the way in to the way out.

845
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:26,202
The rules are different in there.

846
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:32,151
There is no up. There is no down.
There are no straight lines.

847
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:36,030
Which is why
we have to make one.

848
01:09:36,055 --> 01:09:40,850
This rope is our lifeline.
If we let go of it...

849
01:09:40,875 --> 01:09:43,775
we will never find our way.

850
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,397
It worked.

851
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:54,517
Once we've done that.

852
01:09:54,542 --> 01:09:57,682
We send the drone in
to get eyes on Maddie.

853
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,617
Keep it steady now.
Keep it steady.

854
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,373
Keep it steady now.

855
01:12:52,116 --> 01:12:53,408
Maddie.

856
01:12:53,433 --> 01:12:54,998
- Maddie, can you hear me?
- Mommy.

857
01:12:55,023 --> 01:12:57,500
Madison.
Madison.

858
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,900
Madison, honey.

859
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,599
Madison, are you hurt?
It's Mommy.

860
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:04,797
Mommy?

861
01:13:04,822 --> 01:13:06,395
Maddie!

862
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,969
Daddy?

863
01:13:12,646 --> 01:13:15,948
- Madison. Carrigan!
- We're losing her now, get her out.

864
01:13:15,973 --> 01:13:17,192
- I will go.
- No!

865
01:13:17,217 --> 01:13:20,549
Listen to me, Eric. Listen to me.
I'm her mother, I have to go.

866
01:13:20,574 --> 01:13:22,460
- You have to listen. You can't, you have to back me up.
- I'm going in.

867
01:13:22,569 --> 01:13:24,990
She's too close to the light.
I got to go in and get her out.

868
01:13:25,019 --> 01:13:26,314
No, I'm going.

869
01:13:26,339 --> 01:13:28,604
- You can't go. She won't come to a stranger.
- You've never done this before.

870
01:13:28,629 --> 01:13:30,671
You have no idea what
you are dealing with.

871
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:34,832
Shout out and sound
the family service!

872
01:13:34,857 --> 01:13:36,649
- I got to get here out of there now!
- Wait. Everyone stop!

873
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:38,933
- Griffin is already upstairs.
- Griff!

874
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,055
Oh my god.
Griff.

875
01:13:41,191 --> 01:13:42,886
Griffin!

876
01:13:45,292 --> 01:13:46,933
Griffin!

877
01:13:46,974 --> 01:13:50,121
I should have never
left her alone.

878
01:13:50,922 --> 01:13:53,807
No!
Griffin!

879
01:13:53,832 --> 01:13:56,355
- Griffin!
- No!

880
01:14:02,252 --> 01:14:04,693
GRIFFIN!

881
01:14:04,866 --> 01:14:09,566
Griffin!
No!

882
01:14:09,586 --> 01:14:13,249
Go downstairs, grab a hold onto the rope.

883
01:14:13,274 --> 01:14:17,148
When I give you the signal,
pull with all your might.

884
01:14:17,173 --> 01:14:19,364
What if it doesn't work?

885
01:14:19,419 --> 01:14:24,322
Amy, sweetheart.
It's gonna work.

886
01:14:29,663 --> 01:14:31,536
This better work.

887
01:14:31,561 --> 01:14:34,274
Hey man. You seem you
can talk to these things, right?

888
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,459
Well you tell them,
it's time to let Maddie go!

889
01:14:38,632 --> 01:14:40,744
I'm counting on you.

890
01:14:54,677 --> 01:15:00,468
This child has done you no harm.
She speaks no harm.

891
01:15:07,893 --> 01:15:09,625
Wait.
No, no, no...

892
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:12,646
He's off the screen. He's off the screen.
We lost him.

893
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,486
Maddie.

894
01:15:25,450 --> 01:15:27,200
Maddie.

895
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:36,330
Maddie?

896
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:39,681
Griffin.

897
01:15:55,435 --> 01:15:58,067
Maddie, we have to go.

898
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,561
I can't.

899
01:16:00,586 --> 01:16:03,883
Yes, you can.
We have to go now.

900
01:16:14,879 --> 01:16:17,590
They'll never let me leave.

901
01:16:20,895 --> 01:16:22,694
The rope!

902
01:16:28,955 --> 01:16:30,733
The rope!

903
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,856
Run, Maddie.
Come on!

904
01:16:49,822 --> 01:16:51,747
Watch out!

905
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:03,204
Maddie.
Griffin.

906
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:05,900
I got you.
- Come on, baby. You'll be okay.

907
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,190
- Are they breathing?
- Eric!

908
01:17:10,345 --> 01:17:13,005
Mommy's right here.
Mommy, sweetie.

909
01:17:13,636 --> 01:17:15,201
Are they okay?

910
01:17:15,226 --> 01:17:17,892
- What do we do?
- Get them in the water now!

911
01:17:19,004 --> 01:17:20,847
- Wake up, baby. Wake up, baby.
- Griffin, wake up.

912
01:17:20,872 --> 01:17:23,794
Okay, sweetie.
Come on, baby. Wake up.

913
01:17:23,819 --> 01:17:25,663
Can you hear me?
Can you hear Mom?

914
01:17:25,688 --> 01:17:27,241
Alright.
Wake up, sweetheart.

915
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,608
- Come on. Come on. Sweetheart.
- Come on, please. Wake up.

916
01:17:29,633 --> 01:17:31,313
- Come on.
- Griffin, I'm counting on you.

917
01:17:31,338 --> 01:17:34,227
- I need you to wake up right now. Okay.
- Buddy.

918
01:17:34,375 --> 01:17:36,218
- Good boy. Good boy.
- Oh, baby.

919
01:17:36,243 --> 01:17:38,070
- There he is.
- Is Maddie okay?

920
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:39,528
- Yeah. Maddie is okay.
- Is Maddie okay?

921
01:17:39,553 --> 01:17:40,904
Maddie is going to be okay.

922
01:17:40,929 --> 01:17:43,316
- Okay. Can you hear Mommy?
- Come on, sweetheart.

923
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:46,261
Please wake up.
Please wake up.

924
01:17:47,257 --> 01:17:50,070
Oh, sweetheart.
Oh, baby.

925
01:17:50,095 --> 01:17:52,514
Oh sweetheart.
Oh sweetheart.

926
01:17:52,539 --> 01:17:55,166
Hi Mommy.
Hi Daddy.

927
01:17:55,191 --> 01:17:57,479
- Hey.
- Hey sweetie.

928
01:17:57,499 --> 01:18:01,199
It's okay, Mommy.
Griffin's safe.

929
01:18:01,224 --> 01:18:05,525
Yeah, he is. You know why?
Because you're superboy.

930
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:11,181
I love you two.
I love you ten.

931
01:18:11,503 --> 01:18:14,745
Oh my god.
Oh my god.

932
01:18:24,151 --> 01:18:25,778
Alright.
Hop on your sit.

933
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:30,995
- When are we ever coming back?
- No, sweetheart. No way in hell.

934
01:18:32,406 --> 01:18:35,475
Hey. Thanks for everything.
And uh

935
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,354
Hope we'll never see you again.

936
01:18:37,442 --> 01:18:39,722
I don't know why
they always say that.

937
01:18:39,751 --> 01:18:41,883
- Bye.
- Bye.

938
01:18:43,646 --> 01:18:46,765
So tell me.
I deserve it.

939
01:18:51,307 --> 01:18:53,999
Burbank, California 2012.

940
01:18:54,024 --> 01:18:58,453
They were shooting an episode
in a haunted car wash.

941
01:18:58,482 --> 01:19:02,457
And the sound guy
fell asleep.

942
01:19:02,482 --> 01:19:04,645
- So not a ghost?
- No.

943
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:10,992
Just a dozy boom operator
with a very, very large microphone.

944
01:19:13,907 --> 01:19:16,423
- Do the line!
- I'm not saying it.

945
01:19:16,448 --> 01:19:20,743
- Mom, it's for Lauren.
- Burke, give her the line!

946
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:24,246
- The house is cleaned.
- Better. Come on.

947
01:19:24,271 --> 01:19:29,137
- The house... is cleaned.
- Oh my god. She's going to freak.

948
01:19:29,604 --> 01:19:32,979
- This house is cleaned.
- It isn't though.

949
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:34,493
Yes it is, sweetheart.

950
01:19:34,518 --> 01:19:36,818
You helped the spirits
go into the light.

951
01:19:36,843 --> 01:19:39,167
But they didn't.

952
01:19:40,035 --> 01:19:41,598
- Dad. Go.
- Dad. Go, go, go...

953
01:19:41,623 --> 01:19:44,656
They wouldn't go into the light, mommy.
They needed me to take them.

954
01:19:44,681 --> 01:19:48,222
But I wouldn't go away,
so neither did they.

955
01:19:48,256 --> 01:19:51,041
- Dad. Go.
- Dad. Go, go, go...

956
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,248
- Go, go. Dad.
- Dad!

957
01:19:55,071 --> 01:19:56,943
Get out of the car.

958
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:03,664
Mom!

959
01:20:32,023 --> 01:20:34,182
Honey, you okay?

960
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,478
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

961
01:20:37,995 --> 01:20:40,368
Here, baby,
Hold on.

962
01:20:41,721 --> 01:20:45,256
Where' Maddie?
Where is she? Where is she?

963
01:20:45,281 --> 01:20:46,609
Maddie!

964
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:51,481
Mommy?
Something's wrong, Mom.

965
01:20:53,416 --> 01:20:54,962
Maddie.

966
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,195
Maddie!

967
01:21:21,925 --> 01:21:24,039
- Mom.
- Maddie!

968
01:21:24,452 --> 01:21:26,118
- Mom.
- Hold on.

969
01:21:26,143 --> 01:21:27,409
Mom.
Mom!

970
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:29,099
Here, baby.
Come on.

971
01:21:29,124 --> 01:21:30,988
Mommy!

972
01:21:31,014 --> 01:21:32,253
Come on.

973
01:21:33,761 --> 01:21:35,623
Hold on!

974
01:21:57,499 --> 01:22:00,305
- Pull!
- Pull!

975
01:22:03,436 --> 01:22:09,880
Release your hold on this family!
As you yourself wish to be released!

976
01:22:23,118 --> 01:22:24,539
No.
Don't do something stupid.

977
01:22:24,564 --> 01:22:27,623
I know something stupid?
The way you left me.

978
01:22:27,648 --> 01:22:28,837
Carrigan.
Please.

979
01:22:28,878 --> 01:22:31,043
They're never gonna
let this family go.

980
01:22:31,068 --> 01:22:33,524
I'm tired of faking it for
the cameras. Brooke

981
01:22:33,553 --> 01:22:36,740
I'm the only one left who can
lead those souls into the light.

982
01:22:36,765 --> 01:22:38,131
You know that.

983
01:22:38,156 --> 01:22:43,564
- Wait. You don't have to do this.
- I know, I want it.

984
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,665
Wait. How would I know
if you make it back?

985
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:50,376
I'll think of something.
Bye, Brooke.

986
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:59,757
Amy, come here.
Let's go.

987
01:23:04,058 --> 01:23:05,620
Maddie.

988
01:23:06,226 --> 01:23:08,468
Let's go.
Come on.

989
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:13,903
- Watch your head.
- Okay.

990
01:23:13,928 --> 01:23:16,905
Maddie. Maddie.
Okay, let's go.

991
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,558
Mommy's going to get you.

992
01:23:26,583 --> 01:23:28,729
- No. No.
- Kendra. Come here!

993
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:31,552
- Let's go.
- I'm sorry I'm such a bitch to you, Dad.

994
01:23:31,577 --> 01:23:34,470
Okay, honey. Can we talk
about it later? Let's go.

995
01:23:49,911 --> 01:23:54,883
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I got a job to do.

996
01:23:54,908 --> 01:23:56,478
Wait!

997
01:24:05,559 --> 01:24:07,840
- Dad!
- Eric.

998
01:24:08,845 --> 01:24:10,405
Eric, jump.

999
01:24:15,848 --> 01:24:18,048
- Amy, we got to find a car.
- Mom!

1000
01:24:18,068 --> 01:24:22,272
Wait, Eric.
Take mine, go.

1001
01:24:26,493 --> 01:24:28,124
Mom!

1002
01:24:31,688 --> 01:24:33,857
Come on!
Let's go!

1003
01:26:11,559 --> 01:26:13,858
Any sign of him?

1004
01:26:17,792 --> 01:26:21,111
Nothing.
The GPS isn't picking him up.

1005
01:26:25,522 --> 01:26:28,603
Wait, we're getting something.

1006
01:26:42,758 --> 01:26:44,060
- Hello.
- Hi.

1007
01:26:44,085 --> 01:26:48,096
Hello, you obviously found it. Okay.
Isn't it beautiful?

1008
01:26:48,121 --> 01:26:49,264
I think this one is "it".

1009
01:26:49,289 --> 01:26:52,786
I mean great school district,
the high school ball field close by.

1010
01:26:52,806 --> 01:26:54,999
Wait till you see the inside.
4 proper bedrooms

1011
01:26:55,024 --> 01:26:58,366
and the place is just
swimming in closet space.

1012
01:26:58,718 --> 01:27:03,161
- That's aren't really high on our wish list.
- Our last closet eat me.

1013
01:27:03,416 --> 01:27:06,398
That's sweet.
Anyway.

1014
01:27:06,423 --> 01:27:09,979
This house just scream character.
I mean look at the way it's squatting.

1015
01:27:10,004 --> 01:27:13,894
And in here is the foyer,
period detail throughout.

1016
01:27:13,919 --> 01:27:17,481
Oh. And this is the den.
The den leads right into the backyard.

1017
01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:19,161
Perfect for the kids.
And do you see that tree.

1018
01:27:19,186 --> 01:27:21,738
I mean it's ancient.
It was here before...

1019
01:27:21,763 --> 01:27:25,904
Hello?
Hello?

1020
01:27:27,069 --> 01:27:28,782
Perfect.

1021
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:31,917
Let's get outta here.

1022
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:28,178
This labyrinth joined network hosts

1023
01:28:28,294 --> 01:28:30,520
to a malevolent spirit.

1024
01:28:30,551 --> 01:28:32,708
I'm Carrigan Burke.

1025
01:28:32,733 --> 01:28:34,914
- And I am here to flush his ...
- And I am Brooke Powell.

1026
01:28:34,939 --> 01:28:38,184
- And we're here to clean house.
- I hadnt finished.

1027
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,695
- I hadn't finished my line.

1028
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:42,073
I would not say clean house.
Requote that.

1029
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:45,429
Because I thought that my cue was
when you said 'and I'm Carrigan Burke'.

1030
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,150
- I didn't say that.
- As soon as I heard 'and'

1031
01:28:47,179 --> 01:28:48,241
I just came right out.

1032
01:28:48,270 --> 01:28:51,215
- That's the wrong window.
- Okay.

1033
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:53,477
I.

1034
01:28:54,170 --> 01:28:58,050
Do..do...
Does someone want to tell me the right way.

1035
01:28:59,305 --> 01:29:05,367
