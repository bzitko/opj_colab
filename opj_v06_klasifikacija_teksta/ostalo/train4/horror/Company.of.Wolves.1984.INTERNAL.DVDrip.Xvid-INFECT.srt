00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,790
- Hello, Mummy!
- Hello, darling.

3
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,598
- Any presents for me?
- A surprise.

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,113
- What?
- You know.

5
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,193
- No, I don't. What?
- Where is she? Did she miss tea again?

6
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,078
- She said she had tummy ache.
- So, she's sulking in her room?

7
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,754
- It's her age.
- She's a pest.

8
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,876
So were you once. 
Now, go and wake her.

9
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,993
Pest! Pest!

10
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,275
- I want you to have a word with her.
- I have tried. I've been upstairs to see her.

11
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,396
But she tells me 
that I don't understand.

12
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,711
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Well, she's right.

13
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,148
Go away!

14
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,116
<i>They want you downstairs.</i>

15
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,437
<i>You have to come out sometime.
You can't sulk in there for ever.</i>

16
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,593
<i>Open the door!</i>

17
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,636
<i>Open it.</i>

18
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,875
<i>You've been at my lipstick, too, 
haven't you?</i>

19
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,030
<i>Pest!</i>

20
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,110
What makes you so different, anyway?

21
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,156
<i>Buck teeth!</i>

22
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,110
Come on out, pest. It's not because I want you, 
either. It's because Mummy wants you.

23
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,759
Pest, pest, pest.

24
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,269
<i>Pest, pest, pest.</i>

25
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,598
Say goodbye to your sister, now,
so you never forget her.

26
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,956
Stay with me, child.

27
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,914
Chew on this. 
It'll keep your mind off things.

28
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,878
"Man, that is born of a woman,
hath but a short time to live,

29
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,473
<i>and is full of misery.</i>

30
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,518
<i>He cometh up, and is cut down, 
like a flower;</i>

31
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,912
<i>he fleeth as it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay.</i>

32
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,914
<i>In the midst of life 
we are in death."</i>

33
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,513
<i>Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God,
in his great mercy,</i>

34
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,275
<i>to take unto himself the soul 
of our dear sister here departed,</i>

35
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,557
we therefore commit 
her body to the ground;

36
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,553
<i>earth to earth, 
ashes to ashes...</i>

37
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,079
<i>dust to dust.</i>

38
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,874
Your only sister, all alone in the wood, 
and nobody there to save her.

39
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,951
Poor little lamb.

40
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,429
Why couldn't she save herself?

41
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,273
You don't know anything. 
You're only a child.

42
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,436
- Daddy!
- There, there, pet.

43
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,036
Shall I take her home with me tonight?
Her mother's in no fit state to look after her.

44
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,917
- If only you would.
- Come, pet.

45
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,958
- I want to stay with Mummy.
- Mummy's not well. Just for tonight.

46
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,996
Come, child. Come with me.

47
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,351
It's a long way through the wood,
but safe by daylight.

48
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,159
Safe, if you keep to the path...

49
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,352
There's plenty more of these in the woods...
if you know where to look.

50
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,833
Berries!

51
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,228
Don't stray from the path, girl.

52
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,038
Did you not hear what I told you?

53
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,954
Once you stray from the path,
you're lost entirely.

54
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,508
The wild beasts know no mercy.

55
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,310
They wait for us in the wood, in the shadow,
and once you put a foot wrong, they pounce.

56
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,513
There, there, girl. 
Don't take on so.

57
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,071
It's something you have to learn. Otherwise,
you'll end up like your poor, dear sister.

58
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,193
Gran, can I have one?

59
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,350
I don't see why not.

60
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,396
You've got a lot to learn, child.

61
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,358
Oh! Never stray from the path,

62
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,431
never eat a windfall apple,

63
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,193
and never trust a man 
whose eyebrows meet.

64
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,354
The best winter wool, pet,
woven across the valley.

65
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,592
It was so good, so soft,
I thought I'd knit a shawl for your sister.

66
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,194
But now... you know what I'll do?

67
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,396
- What, Gran?
- I'll make one for you.

68
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,155
A very special shawl, 
for a very special lady.

69
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,156
Soft as a kitten.

70
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,472
There's something I should tell you.

71
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,754
Yes?

72
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,230
- But maybe you're too young.
- Tell me, Gran.

73
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,074
- Too young to understand.
- Oh, go on, Gran. Tell me.

74
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,515
Maybe no child is ever too young.

75
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,154
A wolf may be more than he seems.

76
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,755
He may come in many disguises.

77
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,637
What's that?

78
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,793
The wolf that ate your sister
was hairy on the outside,

79
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,189
but when she died, 
she went straight to heaven.

80
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,118
The worst kind of wolves 
are hairy on the inside,

81
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,237
and when they bite you,
they drag you with them to hell.

82
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,235
What do you mean, hairy on the inside?
Like a furry coat?

83
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,790
Hush, now, foolish child. 
Listen.

84
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,429
Once upon a time,
there was a woman in the village...

85
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,795
and she married a traveling man.

86
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,998
They've all gone now.

87
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,514
It's a shame your people 
missed the wedding.

88
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,596
Maybe it is, and...

89
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,636
maybe it isn't.

90
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,276
My little brother's idea of a joke!

91
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,998
Oh!

92
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,876
Why are you staring like that?

93
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,233
Because I've never seen 
anything like you before.

94
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,793
Don't they have girls 
where you come from?

95
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,836
<i>None like you.</i>

96
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,077
Come out of the shadows.

97
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,991
Let me see you, my love.

98
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
Are all traveling men 
as handsome as you?

99
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,594
So, you think I'm handsome?

100
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,110
The first thing I noticed about you...

101
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,431
was the way your eyebrows meet.

102
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,476
Doesn't it spoil me, then?

103
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,356
Come to me, and I'll tell you.

104
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,792
My dear?

105
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,553
I must just go out into the yard 
for a moment.

106
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,719
Why ever for?

107
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,836
Call of nature.

108
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,758
<i>So, she waited.</i>

109
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,711
And she waited.

110
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,756
<i>And she waited again.</i>

111
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,236
Surely, he's been gone a long time?

112
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,716
No, it can't be!

113
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,717
Wolves, indeed!

114
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,394
He upped and ran-- that's all.

115
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,277
It was in his blood.

116
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,316
Yeah. Wasn't he a traveling man?

117
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,314
Anything?

118
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,518
Not a hair nor a hide of him. 
Not a footprint.

119
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,433
And what's that, might I ask?

120
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,637
I told you I heard 
the wolves last night.

121
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,553
They came and took him
when he was making water,

122
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,632
when a man is at his most defenseless!

123
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,469
The murderers! The murderers!

124
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,957
<i>But she was a young thing.</i>

125
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,190
And cheerful of temperament.

126
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,715
And she found another husband,

127
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,314
not too shy to piss in a pot.

128
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,509
<i>And then they lived 
happily ever after?</i>

129
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,352
Indeed, they did not.

130
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,318
<i>But at first, 
time passed happily enough.</i>

131
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,996
What a mess!

132
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,391
Oh, don't start!

133
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,876
Shut up!

134
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,795
Here...

135
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,917
<i>Time passed, 
and she gave him children.</i>

136
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,719
<i>And that was a bad time for wolves, 
those years.</i>

137
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,156
<i>Oh, yes.
 Not a sheep or a cow was safe.</i>

138
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,389
<i>But for herself, 
all went right as a trivet...</i>

139
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,436
<i>until...</i>

140
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,078
<i>one winter's night.</i>

141
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,392
My God...

142
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,076
I'm starving.

143
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,636
- Do you want something to eat?
- Didn't you hear me the first time?

144
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,798
Where did these three spring from?

145
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,279
Out of my belly.

146
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,636
Your children, 
but not my children.

147
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,189
Whore!

148
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,511
Adulteress! 
You hoped I'd never come back!

149
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,639
- I thought the wolves had taken you!
- Better wolf than whore.

150
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,269
If I were a wolf once more,
I'd teach this whore a lesson!

151
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,196
No! No!

152
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,475
He looks just the same...

153
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,870
as the day I married him.

154
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,635
I'd never let a man strike me.

155
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,678
They're nice as pie
until they've had their way with you.

156
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,230
But once the bloom is gone,
oh, the beast comes out.

157
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,751
When the wolves, though, 
the real wolves...

158
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,558
when the real wolves mate,

159
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,915
do the dogs beat the bitches afterwards?

160
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,958
Animals. 
All wild animals.

161
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,594
Well, that's enough wool for tonight.

162
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,193
Bedtime.

163
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,678
What about a kiss for Granny?

164
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,028
Don't I deserve a kiss... 
for my story?

165
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,436
The best of all girls!

166
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,310
Learn how to sew, 
how to take care of things,

167
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,436
how to press things.

168
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,876
There isn't anything in the house
that you won't be able to do.

169
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,110
Learn how to be useful.

170
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,156
Useful.

171
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,118
I'm sure you'll find it will almost 
certainly turn out to be a toadstool,

172
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,158
and make you deathly ill.

173
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,350
Of course, you won't stay 
a young girl much longer.

174
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,398
Your mummy and daddy
will need all the help they can get.

175
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,631
You must grow wise and learn all you can,
now that your sister has gone.

176
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,393
<i>Wolfie, wolfie, 
you can't catch me</i>

177
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,392
<i>I've got a wife and a family...</i>

178
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,436
- <i>Wolfie, wolfie...</i>
- Caught!

179
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,274
- Caught who, you snotty-nosed ragamuffin?
- Caught Rosaleen.

180
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,510
Oh, nobody catches my little princess.

181
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,792
Come along, child.

182
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,189
Run, quickly, over here!

183
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,158
There's too much food
now there's just the three of us.

184
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,674
<i>Don't grieve.</i>

185
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,433
Least said, soonest mended.

186
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,909
<i>Rosaleen!</i>

187
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,158
- Shall we play now?
- Play what?

188
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,719
A game.

189
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,950
I know a good game. 
Close your eyes.

190
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,991
Now, come to me.

191
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,912
Closer.

192
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,956
Closer. Come on.

193
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,556
Come closer.

194
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,468
There.

195
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,993
Now what?

196
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,036
Can't catch me!

197
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,075
- Mummy...
- Yes, pet?

198
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,870
- Does he hurt you?
- Does who hurt me?

199
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,633
Does Daddy hurt you, when he...

200
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,438
No, not at all.

201
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,080
- It sounds like...
- Like what?

202
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,116
Like the beasts Granny talked about.

203
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,755
You pay too much attention 
to your granny.

204
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,392
She knows a lot,
but she doesn't know everything.

205
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,156
And if there's a beast in men,
it meets its match in women, too.

206
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,231
Do you understand me?

207
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,276
Get up and fetch me some water.

208
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,078
- Rosaleen...
- Yes?

209
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,559
I've got you a little present.

210
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,949
What kind of present?

211
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,472
I thought maybe you'd take 
a walk with me in the woods.

212
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,028
On Sunday after the service.

213
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,678
Just a little walk, Rosaleen.

214
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,273
Why should I?

215
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,113
I thought maybe you'd want to.

216
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,119
- I'll have to ask.
- But tell your mother I'll be with you.

217
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,036
And we won't stray from the path.

218
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,198
They're the best of all roses,
fit for the grave of a princess.

219
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,589
They came off my best rose tree.

220
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,552
Why can't Mummy grow roses like that?

221
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,110
Well, it's a question of a green thumb.
She lacks that.

222
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,270
No hand at pastry, either.

223
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,590
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.

224
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,389
They say the priests' bastards
often turn into wolves as they grow older.

225
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,711
What do you mean?

226
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,792
If the child is born on Christmas Day,
if he's born feet first, he'll be the one.

227
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,633
If he's born feet first,
and his eyebrows meet in the middle.

228
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,392
Oh, yes.

229
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,232
Very bad.

230
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,517
One day, he'll meet the Devil in the wood.

231
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,630
Now, use it wisely.

232
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,116
Waste not, want not.

233
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,476
No! No! No!

234
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,473
<i>No! No! No!</i>

235
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,359
That's a horrid story. 
I didn't like it at all.

236
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,353
It's not a story, child. 
It's the God's own truth.

237
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,908
So, if you should spy 
on a naked man in the wood,

238
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,275
run as if the Devil himself 
were after you.

239
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,389
The Devil's one thing,
but a priest making babies is another.

240
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,516
I don't think our priest 
would have it in him.

241
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,912
Well, you can't trust anyone, least of all 
a priest. He's not called Father for nothing.

242
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,753
And don't bother to whisper. 
He's deaf as a post.

243
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,149
There. 
Isn't that lovely?

244
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,597
All we need is a nice border and fringe.
See how soft it feels.

245
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,712
Soft as snow.

246
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,519
- Red as a berry.
- Red as blood.

247
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,753
Does the old fool want to brain me?
What's he up to in the tree, the old monkey?

248
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,233
Father, Father, are you climbing up to heaven
and chopping the rungs of the ladder after you?

249
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,993
Watch what you're doing. 
Can you hear me?

250
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,312
Don't make so much clamor in the garden of God's 
house, you irreverent woman. I heard every word.

251
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,675
- Watch your silly game!
- Someone's got to do it.

252
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,470
Someone's got to cut away the old wood.
Even evergreens need pruning.

253
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,876
Daddy, leave her be.

254
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,711
He only asked me to walk with him.
What's wrong with that?

255
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,439
- All the same, I don't know...
- Oh, what's the harm in it?

256
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,990
He's our neighbor. She's known him since 
she was a baby. She still is a baby.

257
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,914
- So was our Alice once.
- Oh, she'll be gone soon. She's so pretty.

258
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,470
What is it they say?
"It's not losing a daughter; it's gaining a son."

259
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,835
Stop teasing me.
He only asked me to walk with him.

260
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,876
Well, one thing leads to another.

261
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,710
Isaiah, Chapter 11, Verses 6 to 8.

262
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,072
<i>"The wolf also shall dwell 
with the lamb,</i>

263
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,276
<i>and the leopard shall lie down 
with the kid...</i>

264
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,514
<i>and the calf and the young lion 
and fatling together,</i>

265
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,831
<i>and a little child shall lead them.</i>

266
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,673
And the cow and the bear shall feed.

267
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,228
Their young ones shall lie down together...

268
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,953
and the lion shall eat straw, 
like the ox.

269
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,599
And the suckling child
shall play on the hole of the asp,

270
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,470
and the weaned child shall put his hand
on the cockatrice' den.

271
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,396
They shall not hurt, nor destroy,
in all my holy mountain;

272
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,790
<i>for the earth shall be full
of the knowledge of the Lord...</i>

273
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,793
as the waters cover the sea."

274
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,872
- I do think she's pretty.
- Yes.

275
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,315
That's my boy!

276
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,796
Don't stray from the path.

277
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,640
- When do you have to be back, Rosaleen?
- Soon.

278
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,635
Why are you so crabby today?
I thought you wanted to come.

279
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,676
And what if I did?

280
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,153
Well, you should...

281
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,196
What should I?

282
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,473
You know.

283
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,516
I don't know.

284
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,589
Look.

285
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,553
It's pretty, but not as pretty as you.

286
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,436
- Wasn't that nice?
- No.

287
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,316
What's wrong, Rosaleen?

288
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,919
Don't you like me?

289
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,956
Oh, no, I like you.

290
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,156
I like you well enough.

291
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,196
Well, why won't you kiss me?

292
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,998
- You're afraid, aren't you?
- I'm not afraid.

293
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,876
Well?

294
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,155
That wasn't very good. 
Give me another.

295
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,753
You'll have to catch me first.

296
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,596
Rosaleen?

297
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,156
<i>Rosaleen?</i>

298
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,832
Rosaleen?

299
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,076
Rosaleen?

300
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,836
Rosaleen?

301
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,996
Where are you?

302
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,354
Oh, Jesus!

303
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,476
Wolf! Wolf!

304
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,197
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf!

305
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,990
Wolf!

306
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,516
Where's my daughter? 
What have you done?

307
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,830
- She ran away from me!
- Where's my daughter?

308
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,196
- Where's Rosaleen?
- Get your hands off him!

309
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,840
- Don't you hit my boy!
- You pig!

310
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,753
Your son left my only daughter
to the mercy of the wolves!

311
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,796
A daughter's one thing; 
a heifer's another.

312
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,749
Stop it! Stop it!

313
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,350
I'll cool you off!

314
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:05,196
My darling, where have you been?

315
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,957
You're in such a state.

316
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,359
Look, Mummy.

317
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,315
Take care, won't you? 
And take this.

318
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,073
No. This is all these beasts understand.

319
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,720
Kill them before they kill you. 
That's the way.

320
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,075
Keep close.

321
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,116
Keep close.

322
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,711
There was once a village
so plagued with the beasts,

323
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,791
that they drew one up 
in the bucket of the well.

324
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,714
Hush your antique gossip,
unless you want the wolves to hear it.

325
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,552
We're nearly there.

326
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:23,599
You're such a big girl now, aren't you?
Come on. Hold still.

327
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,878
There you are, big girl. Be careful with those boys
or they'll take you in the woods again.

328
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,315
What boys?
Clowns are what the village boys are.

329
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,915
Your granny spoils you.
She makes you think you're something special.

330
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,956
That red shawl!

331
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:42,318
You think wolves are big now?
You should have seen 'em when I were a lad.

332
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,551
Monsters, they was. 
That's the truth.

333
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,390
Veritable monsters. 
Big as a man.

334
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,356
Bigger.

335
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,270
When will Daddy have done with the killing?

336
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:05,075
When the beast is dead,
and not until the beast is dead.

337
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,076
We won't live quiet until then.

338
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,159
Be winter soon.

339
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,119
A hard winter.
A hard winter brings out the wolf.

340
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,156
Thank God we're safe indoors.

341
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,836
We must hide in the trees!

342
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,835
Settle that duck, boy. 
Quickly.

343
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,036
Douse the lights!

344
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,753
Into the trees.

345
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,353
Come on. Quickly.

346
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,436
Quickly, boy. 
Quickly.

347
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,396
<i>Over here. Over here.</i>

348
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,356
<i>Come on!</i>

349
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,436
<i>Come on!</i>

350
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,877
Granny says wolves might not 
always be what they seem.

351
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,520
How can a wolf be worse 
than it already is?

352
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,875
Not worse, but different.

353
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,633
Maybe it isn't the wolf's fault, Mummy.

354
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,472
Maybe...

355
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,198
Maybe what?

356
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,236
Maybe, once upon a time...

357
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,197
Are you going to tell me a story?

358
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,998
Maybe I am.

359
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,036
Go on, then.

360
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,396
Once upon a time...
there was a woman in the valley.

361
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,708
Mmm?

362
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,917
And the son of the big house
did her a terrible wrong.

363
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,115
Ohh.

364
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,351
So, she came to his wedding,
to put wrong to right.

365
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,752
My dear, she was a beautiful lady.
No-one would have suspected a thing.

366
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,676
This is the happiest day of my life.

367
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,276
Shall we, my dear?

368
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,036
Ladies and gentlemen...

369
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,678
a toast.

370
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,830
To the bride and groom.

371
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,480
- To the bride and groom.
- To the bride and groom.

372
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,358
- Come on, lad. Kiss the girl!
- Go on, my dear.

373
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,876
- Come on.
- It would be a pleasure!

374
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,318
Come, my dear.

375
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,276
A taste of what's to come.

376
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,914
What? Er... sorry. 
Nothing, my dear.

377
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,271
Well done, sir. 
Very good.

378
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,676
Your every happiness, my dear.

379
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,911
So, I wasn't good enough for you?

380
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,516
I was once.

381
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,593
Once upon a time.

382
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,796
Don't you remember?

383
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,631
Well, don't you?

384
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,429
The wolves in the forest are more decent.

385
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,674
<i>What's going on?</i>

386
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:24,436
Where did you hear a story like that?

387
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,593
Not a story, but God's honest truth.
Granny told me.

388
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,559
And after that, the woman made the wolves
come to sing to her and the baby at night.

389
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,437
Made them come and serenade her.

390
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,830
But what pleasure would there be in that--
listening to a lot of wolves?

391
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,956
Don't we have to do it all the time?

392
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,999
The pleasure would come...
from knowing the power that she had.

393
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,956
Dad, it's a wolf!

394
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,593
Got you, you hound of hell!

395
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,312
Praise be to God!

396
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,594
When I cut it off the carcass for a trophy,
it was a forepaw.

397
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:34,157
The forepaw of the biggest wolf I ever saw.

398
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,076
The wolf that killed our Alice?

399
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,837
Aye, maybe.

400
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:45,434
When I cut it with a knife, 
it was a forepaw-- I swear!

401
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,670
A grizzled, giant wolf.

402
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,277
And then, before my very eyes...

403
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,513
Whose is it, Daddy? 
Is it someone you knew?

404
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,955
What do I know whose hand it is?
All I know is what I see.

405
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:02,110
Get it out.

406
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,430
Was it a wolf or a man you killed?

407
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,229
When I killed it, it was a wolf.
It turned into a man.

408
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,992
Seeing is believing.

409
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:14,197
Is it? 
What about touching?

410
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,909
Get it out!

411
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,233
Whatever it is... 
now it's dead meat.

412
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,754
Do we bury it or burn it, Daddy?

413
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:48,879
You're besotted with that old lady--
her and her old wives' tales.

414
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,916
Maybe you shouldn't go.

415
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,719
Daddy killed the great wolf.
I'll be safe in the forest now.

416
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,270
Mind you don't stray,
and take something to protect yourself.

417
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,556
How about a knife?

418
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,673
You're not afraid of anything, are you?
You're a fearless child-- I'll say that.

419
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:16,918
I suppose your granny will ask you to stay 
the night. You always were her favorite.

420
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,516
Of course I'll stay the night, if she asks me.
It would be rude not to. She is my grandmother.

421
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,876
And she may not have a kind word for you,
but she's always been good to me.

422
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,474
She's all alone out there, Mummy.

423
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:31,633
Maybe you're right and maybe you're not.
Give her that from me.

424
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,599
And don't stray, now, Rosaleen.
I trust you. You won't be lucky twice.

425
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,636
I promise.

426
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,272
Rosaleen!

427
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,397
- Where are you going?
- Off to see my granny.

428
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,836
It's a long way through the woods.
Let me come with you. You'll be safe with me.

429
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,639
Go into the woods with you?
After what happened last time?

430
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:33,792
Let me come. 
I'll protect you.

431
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,030
No. I've got this to protect me.

432
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,870
Miss.

433
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,552
Where did you spring from?

434
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,790
Did I scare you? I am sorry.

435
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,916
At least you've got your clothes on.

436
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,120
Huntsman, are you? 
Lost your horse?

437
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:42,398
Lost my horse and lost my companions,
young lady.

438
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,436
And lost your way, too.

439
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:49,913
I do believe I just found it.

440
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:56,112
I say, do you think you could 
spare me a drink out of that?

441
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,156
Well, I would, but it's for my granny.

442
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,909
I know the very place, up the way, 
for a picnic.

443
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:24,920
I have the most remarkable object 
in my pocket.

444
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:28,794
That means I'll never lose my way 
in the wood.

445
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,836
In your pocket, you say?

446
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,912
This object goes everywhere with me.

447
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:40,355
Whenever, that is, I wear my trousers.

448
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,076
Go on. Bite it.

449
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,918
Don't you know how strong that stuff is?

450
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,878
<i>A man in our village keeps a still.</i>

451
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,916
He has the reddest nose you ever saw.

452
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,833
He tells lies, too.

453
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,319
<i>Like you.</i>

454
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,550
I don't believe there is such a thing.

455
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,956
Seeing is believing.

456
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,791
The little needle always points north,
no matter where I go,

457
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,838
so I always know exactly where I am.

458
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,955
I don't believe it, 
even though I see it.

459
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,838
It was this compass that brought me safe 
through the wood.

460
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,870
But you lost your way in the wood.

461
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,076
But... I found you.

462
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:01,192
- Are you sorry?
- <i>No. I'm not sorry.</i>

463
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,236
They're clowns, the village boys.

464
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,352
- Well, then...
- But you should never leave the path.

465
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,637
I've only just got onto the path.
I was perfectly safe before.

466
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,676
Aren't you afraid of the wolves?

467
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,836
Why should I be frightened of the wolves?

468
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:20,874
You must know the worst wolves 
are hairy on the inside.

469
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,273
Old wives' tales! 
Peasant superstition.

470
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:29,673
What? A bright, young girl-- pretty, intelligent 
girl like you-- believing in werewolves!

471
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,352
But my granny said that...

472
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,790
For believing in old wives' tales...

473
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,118
you...

474
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,116
deserve...

475
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,596
to be...

476
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:49,189
punished!

477
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,878
I'll show you I'm not afraid 
of the wolves, Rosaleen.

478
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,157
I'll make a bet with you.

479
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:07,233
I'll bet you anything you like that I get 
to your granny's house before you do.

480
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:08,435
How?

481
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,355
Because I'll use my compass
to help me across the country,

482
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:17,238
while you trudge along the dreary path.

483
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,756
Bet me your compass.

484
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,158
Bet you...

485
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,918
your heart's desire.

486
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,638
And if I lose?

487
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,676
You can...

488
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,872
give me...

489
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:38,148
a kiss.

490
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,440
Here. Take my hat as a token of goodwill.

491
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,476
Wear it until we meet again.

492
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,035
- Who is it?
- <i>Only your granddaughter.</i>

493
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,714
Lift up the latch and walk in.

494
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:24,471
God save us!

495
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,391
Get thee back to hell 
from whence you came!

496
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,033
I don't come from hell. 
I came from the forest.

497
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,793
- What did you do with my granddaughter?
- Nothing she didn't want.

498
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,548
Who's there?

499
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,076
- <i>Only your granddaughter.</i>
- Lift up the latch and walk in.

500
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:32,353
So, you got here before me.
Just as you said you would.

501
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:34,237
I did.

502
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,878
Where's my granny?

503
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,269
Gone out to the woodpile 
to fetch more logs.

504
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:43,670
A real gentleman would never let 
an old lady go out, not on a night like this.

505
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,637
She won't be long.

506
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,115
She's not there.

507
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,470
Is that all you left of her?

508
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,475
Your kind can't stomach hair, can you?
Even if the worst wolves are hairy on the inside.

509
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,189
- What do you know about my kind?
- My granny told me plenty!

510
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,473
Are you very much afraid?

511
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,313
It wouldn't do me much good 
to be afraid, would it?

512
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:38,916
- What big eyes you have!
- All the better to see you with.

513
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,470
They say seeing is believing,
but I'd never swear to it.

514
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,236
You must be wet through.
Won't you take off your shawl?

515
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,276
Uh-uh.

516
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,394
- What shall I do with it?
- Into the fire. You won't need it again.

517
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,758
Your kind can't stomach clothes, either.

518
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,069
Who's come to sing us carols, then?

519
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:37,836
Only my companions, darling.
I love the company of wolves.

520
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,673
Look out of the window, 
and you'll see them.

521
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,873
<i>Poor creatures.</i>

522
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,838
It's freezing cold out there.

523
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,876
<i>No wonder they howl so.</i>

524
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,036
- What? Are you sorry for them?
- Yes, and for you, too.

525
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,233
You're a bold, fearless girl, 
aren't you?

526
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,754
And now you must give me back 
my gun, my dear.

527
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:36,108
Are you our kind or their kind?

528
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,112
Not one nor the other. Both.

529
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:44,237
Then where do you live? 
In our world or theirs?

530
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,991
I come and go between them.
My home is nowhere.

531
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,196
Are you only a man 
when you dress like one?

532
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,036
<i>Like Granny said?</i>

533
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,514
My, what big arms you have!

534
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,556
All the better to hug you with.

535
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:26,838
Well...

536
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:29,598
Perhaps.

537
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,909
You did win your bet, didn't you?

538
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,072
You're a gentleman. 
You're a fine gentleman.

539
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,759
<i>They say the Prince of Darkness 
is a gentleman,</i>

540
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,308
<i>and, as it turns out, 
they're right.</i>

541
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,913
<i>A fine gentleman.</i>

542
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:49,869
Gentlemen always keep their promises.
Do ladies keep their promises, too?

543
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:51,757
<i>What do you mean?</i>

544
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,152
Indeed, I won my bet, 
so now... you owe me...

545
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,393
I remember.

546
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,232
A kiss.

547
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,988
Will you be honorable and pay me?

548
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,958
Or... will you not?

549
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,955
Jesus! What big teeth you have!

550
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,552
All the better to eat you with.

551
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,716
I'm sorry.

552
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,916
I never knew a wolf could cry.

553
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,992
Leaving you, are they? 
You'll be all alone.

554
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,679
I'll tell you a story of a wounded wolf.

555
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,949
<i>Once upon a time,
when the village was asleep...</i>

556
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:50,233
<i>a she-wolf came from the world below...</i>

557
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,993
<i>to the world above.</i>

558
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,591
<i>She meant no harm to anyone.</i>

559
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:17,311
<i>But someone meant harm to her.</i>

560
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:27,514
<i>So, she ran, and she ran...</i>

561
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,476
<i>and she ran again.</i>

562
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,276
Who's there?

563
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,397
Who's there?

564
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:18,474
This is holy ground.

565
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,269
Can you speak, my child?

566
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:35,154
Are you God's work or the Devil's?

567
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,790
Oh, what do I care whose work you are?

568
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,999
You poor, speechless creature.

569
01:22:49,880 --> 01:22:53,350
It will heal in time.

570
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:01,075
<i>And the wound did heal,</i>

571
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:04,357
<i>for she was just a girl, after all,</i>

572
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,000
<i>who had strayed from the path 
in the forest,</i>

573
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,753
<i>and remembered what she'd found there.</i>

574
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:53,835
<i>So, back through the forest...</i>

575
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:57,390
<i>she ran and ran...</i>

576
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:24,318
<i>to the well and the village...</i>

577
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,914
<i>from whence she came.</i>

578
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,631
<i>She crept inside...</i>

579
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,950
<i>to the world below.</i>

580
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,870
And that's all I'll tell you...

581
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,629
because that's all I know.

582
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,596
Rosaleen!

583
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:18,789
Rosaleen!

584
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,033
Rosaleen!

585
01:25:58,840 --> 01:25:59,795
No!

586
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,635
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

587
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:08,948
Rosaleen!

588
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,719
<i>"Little girls, this seems to say,</i>

589
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,031
<i>never stop upon your way.</i>

590
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,396
<i>Never trust a stranger friend.</i>

591
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,869
<i>No-one knows how it will end.</i>

592
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:31,799
<i>As you're pretty, so be wise.</i>

593
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:35,190
<i>Wolves may lurk in every guise.</i>

594
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:40,438
<i>Now, as then, 'tis simple truth.</i>

595
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:46,156
<i>Sweetest tongue has sharpest tooth."</i>
