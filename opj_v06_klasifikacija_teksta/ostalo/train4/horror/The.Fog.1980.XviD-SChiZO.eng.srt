2
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:02,601
11:55. Almost midnight.

3
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:06,237
Enough time for one more story.

4
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:11,274
One more story
before 12:00...

5
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:13,753
just to keep us warm.

6
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:21,725
In five minutes,
it will be the 21st of April.

7
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:26,996
One hundred years ago,
on the 21st of April...

8
00:01:27,034 --> 00:01:30,937
out on the waters
around Spivey Point...

9
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:35,706
a small clipper ship
drew toward land.

10
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,443
Suddenly, out of the night,
the fog rolled in.

11
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:43,451
For a moment,
they could see nothing...

12
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,953
not a foot ahead of them.

13
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:49,686
Then they saw a light.

14
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:55,187
By God, it was a fire
burning on the shore...

15
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:59,759
strong enough to penetrate
the swirling mist.

16
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:04,240
They steered a course
toward the light...

17
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:08,472
but it was a campfire
like this one.

18
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:12,915
The ship crashed
against the rocks.

19
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,248
The hull sheared in two.

20
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:18,255
The mast snapped like a twig...

21
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:23,283
and the wreckage sank
with all the men aboard.

22
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,922
At the bottom of the sea...

23
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:30,765
lay the ''Elizabeth Dane''
with her crew...

24
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:34,260
their lungs
filled with salt water...

25
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:38,936
their eyes open
and staring into the darkness.

26
00:02:38,977 --> 00:02:42,936
And above,
as suddenly as it had come...

27
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,778
the fog lifted...

28
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,614
receded
back across the ocean...

29
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:50,315
and never came again.

30
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:53,621
But it is told
by the fishermen...

31
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,628
and their fathers
and grandfathers...

32
00:02:56,662 --> 00:03:01,065
that when the fog returns
to Antonio Bay...

33
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,059
the men
at the bottom of the sea...

34
00:03:05,104 --> 00:03:08,562
out in the water
by Spivey Point...

35
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:13,478
will rise up
and search for the campfire...

36
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:20,010
that led them
to their dark and icy death.

37
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:28,294
Twelve o' clock,
the 21st of April.

38
00:04:22,786 --> 00:04:24,413
It's twelve midnight...

39
00:04:24,454 --> 00:04:26,820
and we just started
into the witching hour.

40
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:30,223
This is Stevie Wayne,
on top of the world tonight.

41
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,628
And I'll be here
right up until about 1:00.

42
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:03,293
I'm all through, Father.

43
00:05:03,328 --> 00:05:06,024
Oh, thank you, Bennett.

44
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:10,797
I won't need you
until four tomorrow, Bennett.

45
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,168
Yes, sir.

46
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:16,408
Would you like something to
keep you warm on the way home?

47
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:19,411
No, thank you.
Father, can I get paid?

48
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:27,483
Why don't you come in at six
instead of four tomorrow?

49
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,681
Yes, sir.

50
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,833
Bennett?

51
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,777
It's 59 degrees outside.

52
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:01,546
And let me be the first
to wish Antonio Bay...

53
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,053
a happy birthday.

54
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:06,614
We're one hundred years old
today.

55
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:08,887
The weatherman's
been trying to spoil it for us.

56
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:11,019
He says we may be
in for some rain tonight.

57
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:15,261
But from where I'm sitting,
it looks like clear skies.

58
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,098
I think the weatherman's
been working too hard.

59
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,071
Well, I'll stay here
for another hour...

60
00:07:20,105 --> 00:07:22,403
just to see if he's right.

61
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,966
And I'm inviting you
to stay here with me.

62
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:30,275
There's a cutter run aground
over here on the east bay, over.

63
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:35,750
Global 1X5.
It's the ''Lady Belle Pacific.''

64
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,987
Serial number 024KL596. Over.

65
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,426
Global 1X5,
the ''Lady Belle Pacific''...

66
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,487
is seaworthy, no major damage.

67
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:46,089
Why don't you
send a tow on over here...

68
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,124
about a quarter mile
above the Boatel. Over.

69
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:50,847
This is KAB,
Antonio Bay, California.

70
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,216
Six minutes after midnight.

71
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,488
Haven't heard
from the weatherman yet...

72
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,997
so I can't say for sure
about that rain...

73
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:03,127
but there's a full moon
and no clouds in the sky.

74
00:12:04,637 --> 00:12:06,127
I'm Stevie Wayne.

75
00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,606
And if you don't have anything
to do right now...

76
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:12,634
I'll be here playing music
all through the witching hour.

77
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:18,609
Even if you do
have something to do...

78
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:20,779
keep me turned on for a while...

79
00:12:20,821 --> 00:12:23,619
and I'll try my best
to do the same for you.

80
00:12:23,657 --> 00:12:24,851
OK!

81
00:12:46,447 --> 00:12:48,972
-How far you going?
-Other side of town.

82
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:50,347
That's close enough.

83
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:55,019
-Make it?
-Yeah. Thank you.

84
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:07,196
Sip?

85
00:13:07,236 --> 00:13:08,726
Thanks.

86
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,371
Listen,
I never hitchhiked before.

87
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,507
I just really want
to be careful.

88
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,450
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

89
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,976
Are you weird?

90
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:27,182
Yes, I am.

91
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,214
Yes, I am weird.

92
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,784
You are weird.
Thank God you're weird.

93
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:34,661
The last one was so normal,
it was disgusting.

94
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,494
He picked me up
in Santa Barbara.

95
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,695
By the time we got to Carmel
he wanted to marry me.

96
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:41,398
Oh, yeah. I thought
you never hitchhiked before.

97
00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:47,534
Not before last week.

98
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,445
You're my...

99
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:52,039
thirteenth ride.

100
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,812
Oh, great. Weird and unlucky.

101
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,480
We'll see.

102
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:01,753
Look out!

103
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:09,995
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

104
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:12,265
-You're sure?
-I think so.

105
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:13,862
What the hell was--

106
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,541
It's exactly twelve minutes
after midnight...

107
00:14:22,582 --> 00:14:24,447
and this is Stevie Wayne.

108
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:26,314
Let's get out of here.

109
00:14:28,554 --> 00:14:31,387
I'm high tonight in the KAB
lighthouse on Spivey Point.

110
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:33,949
And in case you've forgotten,
it's April 21st...

111
00:14:33,993 --> 00:14:36,223
and a happy birthday
for Antonio Bay.

112
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:39,129
Now, there's a celebration
planned for tonight.

113
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:42,966
So if you're so excited
about it you can't sleep...

114
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,597
well, stay up with me...

115
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,941
and I'll figure out some way
to keep you occupied.

116
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:52,138
Or not.

117
00:14:57,751 --> 00:14:59,652
-KAB.
-Hi, sweetheart.

118
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,848
Hi, Dan. What have you got?

119
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:03,754
Well, I'm just calling
to see if you're lonely...

120
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:05,019
if there's anything
I can do about it.

121
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,788
Never lonely, Dan.

122
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:08,090
I thought
you were off work at 8:00.

123
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:10,529
I changed shifts to make it
to the big party tonight.

124
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:11,691
Will you be there?

125
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:15,191
Until I can talk someone else...

126
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:18,467
into giving up city life
for Antonio Bay, I'm it.

127
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:21,476
-And ''it'' means day and night.
-Too much work.

128
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,478
That's what I get
for owning a station.

129
00:15:23,512 --> 00:15:24,604
And if you don't tell me
why you called...

130
00:15:24,647 --> 00:15:26,945
in about fifteen seconds,
I'll have to hang up on you.

131
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,450
-Want something to talk about?
-Anything.

132
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:31,885
I've got a position
on a trawler about...

133
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,583
fifteen miles out
called the ''Sea Grass.''

134
00:15:35,624 --> 00:15:37,182
And I've got
something on my scope--

135
00:15:37,226 --> 00:15:39,126
appears to be a fog bank.

136
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:42,495
It's about 25 miles out,
moving in their direction.

137
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:46,263
Thanks, Dan.
That's worth about ten seconds.

138
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,328
I'm on the air. Bye.

139
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,667
Ahoy, maties.

140
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:57,578
This is KAB, Antonio Bay.

141
00:15:57,614 --> 00:16:01,483
Stevie Wayne here
beaming a signal across the sea.

142
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,750
To the men of the ''Sea Grass,''
fifteen miles out tonight...

143
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,154
a warm hello...

144
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,920
and keep a watch out
for that fog bank...

145
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,756
heading in from the east.

146
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:12,262
Now, in the meantime...

147
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:14,924
relax with me
while I play this song...

148
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:18,594
from the Coupe DeVilles,
dedicated just to you.

149
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,333
Boy, would I like to meet her.

150
00:16:21,373 --> 00:16:22,601
I saw her
at a grocery store one day.

151
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,609
-And?
-You would like to meet her.

152
00:16:24,643 --> 00:16:27,612
She's crazy.
There's no fog bank out there.

153
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:29,113
What do you know about her?

154
00:16:29,147 --> 00:16:31,479
-She owns that lighthouse.
-I know that.

155
00:16:31,516 --> 00:16:33,279
Her son plays Little League
with my kid brother.

156
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:34,615
She's a mother?

157
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,280
I thought
you were happily married.

158
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:37,948
Not that happy.

159
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:40,787
No fog bank out there.

160
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:50,336
There's a fog bank out there.

161
00:16:52,171 --> 00:16:55,197
All right. I'm drunk enough.

162
00:16:55,241 --> 00:16:57,175
Let's go back.

163
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,041
All right, all right.

164
00:17:03,217 --> 00:17:05,708
Al, come here.

165
00:17:05,753 --> 00:17:08,051
-Just give him a hand.
-Come here.

166
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,394
What was that?

167
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,158
Come here.

168
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,661
What was that?

169
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:06,943
It's the generator.

170
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,378
Wha--wha...

171
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,753
Al.

172
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,701
It's gone.

173
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:35,609
There was just a ship out there.

174
00:18:35,646 --> 00:18:37,273
Al, listen.

175
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,442
Nothing.

176
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,645
-Listen.
-Who's there?

177
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,890
Who is that?

178
00:19:43,752 --> 00:19:45,481
Al, it's right beside us.

179
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:52,154
It's big, Al. It's a ship.

180
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:53,956
It's a big ship!

181
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:59,463
What happened?
Did you get wet?

182
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,486
It's 12:43...

183
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,890
and I've got
four in a row for you...

184
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:26,191
right here on KAB.

185
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,167
Nothing but water, Stevie.

186
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,167
But it sure beats Chicago.

187
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:16,978
KAB.

188
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:18,711
I like what you said...

189
00:21:18,751 --> 00:21:21,049
but for your information,
you lied.

190
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:23,452
The fog bank
has moved due west...

191
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:27,119
and probably
missed the ship entirely.

192
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,991
Well, my gauges must be wrong.

193
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:30,724
I've got a wind blowing
due east.

194
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:33,324
What kind of a fog
blows against the wind?

195
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:35,834
-You got me.
-I'm not so sure I want you.

196
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,666
You're just
a voice on the phone.

197
00:21:37,704 --> 00:21:41,003
You're a voice on the radio.
We'd make a perfect couple.

198
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,036
You let me take you to dinner
tonight, I'll prove it to you.

199
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,980
Sorry, Dan.

200
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,246
My idea of perfection
is a voice on the phone.

201
00:21:51,285 --> 00:21:53,981
OK, mystery lady.

202
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,421
-Good night.
-Good night.

203
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:18,505
Not bad.

204
00:22:20,282 --> 00:22:22,807
I started a week ago
in San Diego...

205
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:26,253
right up the coast,
five drawings a day.

206
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,086
It'll probably take me a month
to get to Vancouver...

207
00:22:28,124 --> 00:22:29,682
and if I can sell them
for five bucks apiece...

208
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:32,024
-I'll be rich.
-Yeah.

209
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:36,831
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

210
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:38,891
What's your name?

211
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:41,597
-Elizabeth.
-Nick.

212
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:44,367
-Hello, Nick.
-Hi.

213
00:22:46,142 --> 00:22:48,236
Is that where you're from,
San Diego?

214
00:22:48,278 --> 00:22:50,678
Wait a minute. You said,
''Can I ask something?''

215
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:52,909
Well, something,
to me, means one thing.

216
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,612
-San Diego is two things.
-OK.

217
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:02,347
Pasadena, and a lot of money.

218
00:23:02,392 --> 00:23:04,826
Never a chance to do
anything I want to do.

219
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,696
What do you want to do?

220
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:14,830
I don't know.

221
00:23:14,873 --> 00:23:18,070
That's OK. Me, neither.

222
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:20,839
I think I got to have this one.
Can I buy it?

223
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:24,172
The drawing's free.

224
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,707
It's 1:00, straight up...

225
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:27,339
the end of the witching hour,
and time for me to sign off.

226
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:36,317
So until tomorrow night,
at 6 P.M...

227
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:38,485
when KAB
comes back on the air...

228
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:41,291
this is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

229
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:44,231
hoping you have
a nice rest of the night.

230
00:26:42,523 --> 00:26:44,252
Hey, Mom !

231
00:26:49,497 --> 00:26:52,524
Mom, come on. Get up.
Look what I found.

232
00:26:52,568 --> 00:26:57,198
Andy...I love you...

233
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:59,673
but sometimes
you're a real pain.

234
00:26:59,708 --> 00:27:01,335
Sure, Mom, but look it.

235
00:27:01,377 --> 00:27:02,708
First, it was a gold coin.

236
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:05,509
Then it turned into
this neat piece of wood.

237
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:07,105
This is one of those times.

238
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,844
Look at it, Mom.

239
00:27:13,056 --> 00:27:15,024
Good morning, Andrew.

240
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:17,151
Did you have a nice time
last night?

241
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:20,185
Yeah. Old Mr. Machen
told us ghost stories.

242
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,960
Did you thank Mrs. Kobritz
for bringing you home?

243
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:26,298
Yes, ma'am. Mom, can I have
a stomach pounder and a Coke?

244
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,737
-After lunch.
-OK.

245
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,469
I'm gonna go look
for another one.

246
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:34,000
Maybe this time
I can get the gold coin.

247
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,567
Where the hell is he?

248
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:02,732
Rolled out of here
at 4:15 yesterday.

249
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:05,140
-That's the last I saw of him.
-Al said 7:30, right here.

250
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:07,270
You know Al.
If I were you--

251
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,802
Did you call
the Coast Guard, Hank?

252
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:10,873
Nick, they probably
got drunk last night.

253
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:13,784
-No, he wouldn't do that.
-He'd do anything.

254
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:16,084
Al and I got drunk so many times
I can't count them all...

255
00:28:16,122 --> 00:28:19,421
but we never got so shitfaced
we couldn't make it back in.

256
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:21,450
He's too good a sailor
to stay out there all night...

257
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:22,791
and not let somebody know.

258
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:25,662
-You sound like his wife.
-Just his friend.

259
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,495
-You worry too much, Nick.
-Yeah.

260
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:31,966
Where are we going?

261
00:28:32,005 --> 00:28:34,974
I'm going to talk Ashcroft
into taking out his boat...

262
00:28:35,008 --> 00:28:36,566
and looking for the ''Sea Grass.''

263
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,077
Who's Ashcroft?

264
00:28:38,112 --> 00:28:40,080
Someone who owes me a favor.

265
00:28:40,114 --> 00:28:42,082
Can I come along?

266
00:28:42,116 --> 00:28:44,584
I thought you had to move on
to Vancouver?

267
00:28:44,618 --> 00:28:45,846
Eventually.

268
00:28:53,027 --> 00:28:55,291
The sheriff
will drive his own car.

269
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,128
The mayor and his wife
are to be picked up at 6:45...

270
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,157
and brought to the mayor's box.

271
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:02,692
Then we will have speeches
by the mayor...

272
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:04,602
the sheriff, and me.

273
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:06,937
-Do you have my notes?
-Yes, ma'am.

274
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,772
Then we will pass out
the candles...

275
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,573
and begin the procession.

276
00:29:10,612 --> 00:29:13,514
Then I will go home
and pass out.

277
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:15,744
I'm almost afraid to look.

278
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:17,046
Well...

279
00:29:19,955 --> 00:29:21,923
Not bad. Not bad at all.

280
00:29:21,957 --> 00:29:23,788
A work of art.

281
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:26,954
Sandy, just be civil to me
for another five hours.

282
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,588
That's all I ask.

283
00:29:28,631 --> 00:29:30,098
Let's see now.

284
00:29:30,132 --> 00:29:31,929
The candles.
Did you order the candles?

285
00:29:31,967 --> 00:29:33,697
What a thought--a candlelight
procession with no candles.

286
00:29:33,737 --> 00:29:36,001
All taken care of.

287
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:38,303
And the promotional material--
did you get that to Stevie?

288
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,775
Signed, sealed, and delivered.

289
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,574
Sandy, you can be a very
annoying person at times...

290
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:44,978
but you do keep me together.

291
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:47,006
Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

292
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:20,144
...Spivey Point.
As of 1:57 today...

293
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,085
the ''Sea Grass''
had not responded...

294
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,020
to radio communication.

295
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,081
The Coast Guard
has begun a sweep...

296
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,819
south from Watley...

297
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,486
around Arcom Reef...

298
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,689
and should be
in the area of Spivey Point...

299
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,199
in approximately one hour.

300
00:30:34,234 --> 00:30:37,533
Repeating this bulletin
from the Coast Guard...

301
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,538
be on the look out
for the ''Sea Grass''...

302
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:41,369
a thirty-foot trawler...

303
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:45,844
last seen approximately 15 miles
east of Spivey Point.

304
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,869
If you sight this vessel...

305
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:50,610
please notify
the Coast Guard immediately.

306
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:05,731
Nick, can I ask you a question?

307
00:31:05,766 --> 00:31:07,165
Is it always like this?

308
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,170
It's always different.

309
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:12,229
You're worried, aren't you?

310
00:31:12,273 --> 00:31:15,641
Yeah. She can get real mean.

311
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,042
There.

312
00:31:28,323 --> 00:31:31,258
If I can just get through
the speeches without yawning.

313
00:31:31,293 --> 00:31:33,557
-I couldn't sleep last night.
-Too excited?

314
00:31:33,595 --> 00:31:36,087
No. Al went out on his boat
last night and didn't come home.

315
00:31:36,132 --> 00:31:38,692
-He still isn't back.
-Mrs. Williams!

316
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:40,167
I called the Coast Guard,
and they said...

317
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,329
''Oh, he might have had
engine trouble.''

318
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,532
They said not to worry.

319
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:46,200
He was complaining
about his boat last week.

320
00:31:46,242 --> 00:31:47,709
Maybe you ought to go home.

321
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:50,234
That's the last place
I want to go.

322
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,213
My dog started to bark
at 12:00 last night...

323
00:31:52,248 --> 00:31:54,217
and didn't stop
until 6:00 this morning.

324
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:55,513
What happened?

325
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:57,679
He was pointed toward the ocean
and growling.

326
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:58,881
What does that tell you?

327
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:01,322
My dog goes crazy and
decides to bark at the water.

328
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,326
I heard the church bells
at midnight...

329
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,157
as I started
to drift off to sleep...

330
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:07,891
and my car alarm went off
for absolutely no reason.

331
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:10,491
-Really?
-Woke up the whole block.

332
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:13,230
This town sits around for
100 years and nothing happens...

333
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,603
and then one night,
the whole place falls apart.

334
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,906
Take this line, too.

335
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:24,540
Al! Tommy! Dick!

336
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,745
Cabin and steering house
are empty.

337
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:34,053
Maybe somebody picked them up.

338
00:32:35,728 --> 00:32:37,525
There's water in the generator.

339
00:32:37,563 --> 00:32:39,724
But the deck is dry as a bone.

340
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:08,119
There you have it.
My next project...

341
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:10,994
restoration of
the Morgantown Road Cemetery.

342
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,260
It's historical.
Our ancestors are buried here.

343
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,996
-It'll cost a lot.
-Come on. So?

344
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:17,833
This town should be proud
of its past.

345
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,464
But trying to get
anyone involved...

346
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,941
in community affairs
is like pulling teeth.

347
00:33:21,976 --> 00:33:23,170
Better get
the estimates ready...

348
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,677
for the council meeting
next month.

349
00:33:24,712 --> 00:33:25,838
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,347
Sandy, you're
the only person I know...

351
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,679
who can make ''Yes, ma'am''
sound like ''Screw you.''

352
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:30,979
Yes, ma'am.

353
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:32,144
Now, if we'll just say
a little prayer...

354
00:33:32,186 --> 00:33:34,211
asking that
he not be in his cups.

355
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:42,391
Not a good sign.

356
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:47,627
Father Malone?

357
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,909
Another bad sign.

358
00:33:57,947 --> 00:34:00,677
You try the study,
and I'll look up front.

359
00:34:24,775 --> 00:34:28,506
-Jesus!
-I'm sorry, Mrs. Williams.

360
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:31,241
-Mrs. Williams--
-Are you all right?

361
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:33,374
I have something to show you.

362
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,391
''December 9.

363
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:45,328
''Met with Blake this evening
for the first time.

364
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:46,990
''He stood in the shadows...

365
00:34:47,031 --> 00:34:50,831
''to prevent me from getting
a clear look at his face.

366
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,464
''What a vile disease this is.

367
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:58,466
''He is a rich man
with a cursed condition...

368
00:34:58,511 --> 00:35:00,035
''but this does not
prevent him...

369
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,138
''from trying to better
his situation...

370
00:35:02,181 --> 00:35:04,513
''and that of his comrades
at the colony.''

371
00:35:25,238 --> 00:35:27,763
Every single gauge is broken.

372
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:32,668
-All the glass is shattered.
-Remind you of something?

373
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:34,703
-Last night.
-Your truck.

374
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,882
Thermometer's broken.

375
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:49,387
The mercury's stuck
at twenty degrees.

376
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:56,667
No water got in here,
but something awful cold did.

377
00:35:56,704 --> 00:36:00,835
''December 11.
Blake's proposition is simple.

378
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:03,310
''He wants to move off
Tanzier Island...

379
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:08,009
''and relocate the entire colony
just north of here.

380
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,041
''He has purchased
a clipper ship...

381
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:15,580
''called the 'Elizabeth Dane.'
with part of his fortune....

382
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:19,425
''and asks only for permission
to settle here.

383
00:36:19,462 --> 00:36:22,659
''I must balance my feelings
of mercy and compassion...

384
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:24,758
''toward this poor man...

385
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:27,326
''with my revulsion
at the thought...

386
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,806
''of a leper colony
only a mile distant.''

387
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:51,021
It's rusted to the wall.

388
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:55,931
It was on.

389
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:05,810
They drank a lot of beer
last night.

390
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:07,471
Every night.

391
00:37:07,512 --> 00:37:09,810
What's it like?

392
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:12,817
It's always the same.
Room starts spinning--

393
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:14,045
I mean fishing.

394
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:18,649
You fish.

395
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,318
The only thing I know
about fishing...

396
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:21,690
is you use a lot of worms.

397
00:37:23,796 --> 00:37:25,161
Salt water.

398
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,991
She was clean two nights ago.
I checked her out myself.

399
00:37:30,036 --> 00:37:33,369
Now it's as if she's been
turned over in the water.

400
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:39,638
''April 20.
The six of us met tonight.

401
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,648
''From midnight until 1:00...

402
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:45,140
''we planned the death
of Blake and his comrades.

403
00:37:45,185 --> 00:37:47,847
''I tell myself
that Blake's gold...

404
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:49,856
''will allow
the church to be built...

405
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,586
''and our small settlement
to become a township...

406
00:37:52,626 --> 00:37:55,857
''but it does not soothe
the horror that I feel...

407
00:37:55,896 --> 00:37:59,560
''being an accomplice to murder.''

408
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:06,069
Now what?

409
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:08,166
Wait for the Coast Guard.

410
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:15,005
I'm sorry.

411
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:16,311
What for?

412
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,342
Ever since you picked me up,
things have been going wrong.

413
00:38:19,387 --> 00:38:21,447
The clock broke, the windows
have been breaking...

414
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,048
the weirdo at the door
last night.

415
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,323
-That isn't you.
-I'm not so sure.

416
00:38:26,361 --> 00:38:29,159
Things seem to happen to me.

417
00:38:29,198 --> 00:38:30,529
I'm bad luck.

418
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,731
I don't believe in luck,
good or bad.

419
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:39,036
I don't believe
in anything much...

420
00:38:41,511 --> 00:38:44,036
Something did happen once.

421
00:38:46,382 --> 00:38:48,850
My father was a fisherman.

422
00:38:48,885 --> 00:38:53,345
He ran a trawler
out of Whitely Reef.

423
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:57,723
One night, late,
he was coming back in.

424
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:01,789
He was out beyond the reef,
out near Spivey Point.

425
00:39:01,832 --> 00:39:04,528
He looked to windward...

426
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:08,060
and saw a brig
under shortsail...

427
00:39:08,105 --> 00:39:10,335
heading right for him.

428
00:39:12,843 --> 00:39:16,836
And he radioed.
There was no reply.

429
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:21,478
Nothing moved on the deck,
but she held her course.

430
00:39:22,687 --> 00:39:25,850
My dad and two of his hands
boarded the brig--

431
00:39:25,891 --> 00:39:28,553
the ''Resa Jane.''

432
00:39:28,593 --> 00:39:31,994
No one was on board.

433
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,998
There was food on the table...

434
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:36,330
and a hot, steaming
cup of coffee.

435
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:40,999
But underneath, the tin cup
was rusted to the table.

436
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:44,441
And then something caught
my father's eye.

437
00:39:44,477 --> 00:39:50,973
It was a gold doubloon
minted in Spain, 1867.

438
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:53,679
My dad picked up the coin,
put it in his breast pocket...

439
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:56,017
of his jacket,
and zippered it up.

440
00:39:56,055 --> 00:39:59,855
He came home,
told us the story.

441
00:39:59,892 --> 00:40:04,489
And he unzippered the pocket
to give me the coin.

442
00:40:04,531 --> 00:40:06,055
It was gone.

443
00:40:08,402 --> 00:40:10,393
I think I'll go
to Vancouver now.

444
00:40:16,743 --> 00:40:20,509
''April 21st. The deed is done.

445
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:23,210
''Blake followed
our false fire on shore...

446
00:40:23,251 --> 00:40:27,051
''and his ship broke apart
on the rocks off Spivey Point.

447
00:40:27,088 --> 00:40:29,648
''We were aided
by an unearthly fog...

448
00:40:29,691 --> 00:40:32,387
''that rolled in
as if heaven-sent...

449
00:40:32,427 --> 00:40:36,227
''although God had no part
in our actions tonight.

450
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:38,562
''Blake's gold
will be recovered tomorrow...

451
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,163
''but may the Lord forgive us
for what we have done.''

452
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:46,106
I couldn't read any further.

453
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:51,311
Your grandfather
had a way with words.

454
00:40:53,482 --> 00:40:57,077
Our celebration tonight
is a travesty.

455
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,781
We're honoring murderers.

456
00:41:49,942 --> 00:41:53,400

00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:59,375
The sounds of the surf
from Antonio Bay.

fabulous 1340 KAB,

478
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:45,620
Father, where did you find this?

479
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:49,360
My grandfather hid his sins
in the walls.

480
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,868
When did you find it?

481
00:43:51,903 --> 00:43:55,031
Last night,
just after midnight.

482
00:43:55,073 --> 00:43:56,904
What difference does it make?

483
00:43:56,941 --> 00:43:59,774
That's the same time
the rest of the town fell apart.

484
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,882
And the same time
the six conspirators met...

485
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,320
one hundred years ago.

486
00:44:10,355 --> 00:44:12,482
It's really getting late.

487
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:15,220
There's not much we can do
about any of this.

488
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,957
Are you going to give
the benediction tonight, Father?

489
00:44:18,997 --> 00:44:22,398
Antonio Bay has a curse on it.

490
00:44:22,434 --> 00:44:24,368
Do we take that as a ''no''?

491
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:26,599
Maybe it's just as well.

492
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:32,011
We're leaving now, Father.

493
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:34,070
Will you be all right?

494
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:42,085
I'm going to call Dr. Thayden
and ask him to just drop by.

495
00:44:42,122 --> 00:44:45,149
I think you're taking
all of this much too seriously.

496
00:44:45,192 --> 00:44:48,753
We're all cursed,
Mrs. Williams...

497
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:50,423

Something like
an albatross around the neck...

507
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:48,557
No. More like a millstone...

508
00:45:48,592 --> 00:45:51,390
a plumbing stone, by God.

509
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:53,794

End side two, KAB promos.

515
00:46:37,009 --> 00:46:40,536
How can a man drown
and not touch the water?

516
00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:43,207
He had water in his lungs...

517
00:46:43,249 --> 00:46:46,981
salt water around his mouth,
seaweed in his clothes.

518
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,045
Unless...

519
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:53,817
You OK?

520
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,727
Did you see his eyes?

521
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:58,924
Yeah, I saw his eyes.

522
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,073
Andy, the telephone.

523
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,044
I got it, Mrs. Kobritz.

524
00:47:16,484 --> 00:47:18,349
Andy, where did you get
that piece of driftwood?

525
00:47:18,386 --> 00:47:20,980
I told you, Mom.
On the beach this morning.

526
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:22,512
-Where?
-By the rocks.

527
00:47:22,556 --> 00:47:23,955
What was it doing?

528
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:25,959
First it was a gold coin...

529
00:47:25,993 --> 00:47:28,087
and then it turned
into the wood.

530
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:30,189
Andy, I want you
to stay away from the rocks.

531
00:47:30,232 --> 00:47:31,358
Do you understand?

532
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,698
Don't pick up anything else
off the beach.

533
00:47:33,735 --> 00:47:35,202
It didn't belong to anybody.

534
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:36,864
I know, honey.
It's all right.

535
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:38,702
I just don't want you
to pick up anything else...

536
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,833
unless you come
and get me first. OK?

537
00:47:40,876 --> 00:47:42,639
OK.

538
00:47:42,678 --> 00:47:44,543
Is Mrs. Kobritz there?

539
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:46,547
She just came in.

540
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:50,985
OK. I have to start
the broadcast now.

541
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,420
Andy, promise me you won't
leave the house tonight.

542
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:55,219
Oh, Mom.

543
00:47:55,258 --> 00:47:57,385
Promise me.

544
00:47:57,427 --> 00:47:59,793
Oh, OK.

545
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:01,990
I love you, Andy.

546
00:48:02,031 --> 00:48:04,363
Me, too, Mom. Bye.

547
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:33,057
Ahoy, maties.

548
00:48:33,098 --> 00:48:36,431
This is Stevie Wayne,
your night light...

549
00:48:36,468 --> 00:48:41,428
and KAB, Antonio Bay,
California, is on the air.

550
00:48:41,473 --> 00:48:43,771
I've lined up some tunes
to help you celebrate...

551
00:48:43,808 --> 00:48:46,641
the 100th birthday
of Antonio Bay.

552
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:50,581
So let's get down to business.

553
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:14,065
What did your mother want, Andy?

554
00:49:14,107 --> 00:49:15,506
Nothing.

555
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,772
It must have been something.

556
00:49:17,811 --> 00:49:20,405
Nothing.

557
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:23,883
Mrs. Kobritz,
what are those clouds out there?

558
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:32,488
Evidence of deep
penetrating wounds...

559
00:49:32,527 --> 00:49:34,017
in each ocular orbit...

560
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:36,529
entering into
the cranial cavity.

561
00:49:36,564 --> 00:49:39,089
Also jagged lacerations
to the face...

562
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:40,794
Do you want to wait out front?

563
00:49:40,835 --> 00:49:42,700
I'd rather wait with you.

564
00:49:42,737 --> 00:49:44,102
OK.

565
00:49:44,138 --> 00:49:46,129
Thorax has been crushed...

566
00:49:46,174 --> 00:49:49,508
and the lungs
are filled with fluid.

567
00:49:49,545 --> 00:49:50,705
Talk to you a minute?

568
00:49:58,353 --> 00:50:00,048
She gonna be all right?

569
00:50:00,088 --> 00:50:02,181
-Did you talk to Simms?
-I got him on the radio.

570
00:50:02,224 --> 00:50:04,055
He's coming back
from Bodega Bay.

571
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:05,559
What the hell
happened out there?

572
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:07,391
There was rust
all over everything.

573
00:50:07,429 --> 00:50:09,124
It was like the boat had been
out there a long time...

574
00:50:09,164 --> 00:50:10,564
taking on water.

575
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,397
He was down below
near the bunks.

576
00:50:12,435 --> 00:50:14,733
Nick, his wounds
are covered with algae...

577
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:15,897
his lungs are full...

578
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:17,964
and there's silt
under his fingernails.

579
00:50:18,007 --> 00:50:21,238
I saw Dick Baxter
three days ago in Salinas.

580
00:50:21,277 --> 00:50:22,642
Now he's lying in there
on the table...

581
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:25,147
looking like he's been
underwater for a month.

582
00:50:47,638 --> 00:50:50,163
-Do you feel that?
-I'll tell you what happens.

583
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:53,609
-It just got cold in here.
-The water acts like ice.

584
00:51:04,389 --> 00:51:06,880
A whole body would take a year
to decompose...

585
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:09,393
longer if it was down
far enough, cold enough.

586
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:11,225
But he was on the boat.

587
00:51:11,264 --> 00:51:12,663
He was below decks.

588
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:16,691
No. Dick Baxter
died in the ocean.

589
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:34,746
You remember those three kids
that went diving...

590
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:37,120
for that old boat off the Point?

591
00:51:37,157 --> 00:51:39,250
We got to them,
they'd been down for a week...

592
00:51:39,293 --> 00:51:40,419
maybe ten days.

593
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,157
I swear to you right now,
he's been down longer.

594
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,317
And while the wrecking
of that beautiful ship...

595
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,651
upon our coast was,
of course...

596
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,716
a tragedy to those
who were on the ship...

597
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,059
it still was the catalyst
that brought together...

598
00:53:18,096 --> 00:53:21,156
all of the people
of this wonderful area.

599
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,598
They came together...

600
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:26,035
they formed the charter
for Antonio Bay...

601
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:29,131
the charter by which you have
voted for these councilmen...

602
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:31,768
who sit on my left
and my right tonight.

603
00:53:33,012 --> 00:53:35,810
The Coast Guard's
looking for them.

604
00:53:35,848 --> 00:53:38,146
They're going to cover the area
pretty good...

605
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:42,052
so, really,
all we can do is wait.

606
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:44,249
I understand, Sheriff.

607
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,780
Thank you.

608
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,755
I got to go. I'm up next.

609
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:55,333
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Williams.

610
00:53:58,372 --> 00:54:01,773
It's funny,
but all I can think about...

611
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:05,040
is my silly dog
barking all night...

612
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:10,073
and me just wishing
Al would come home.

613
00:54:12,753 --> 00:54:16,383
Now, we can't have
the chairlady...

614
00:54:16,424 --> 00:54:18,915
of the birthday celebration
in tears, can we?

615
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,393
I don't think you ought
to go out there.

616
00:54:20,428 --> 00:54:24,296
I think that's exactly
what I ought to do.

617
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:26,562
I appreciate
all your help, Nick.

618
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:27,932
That's all right.

619
00:54:45,988 --> 00:54:48,479
I searched
a long time for this one.

620
00:54:48,524 --> 00:54:50,890
I hope you remember it.

621
00:54:55,298 --> 00:54:57,095
Happy 100th, Antonio Bay.

622
00:54:57,134 --> 00:55:00,501
The ceremonies are underway
at Shelby Square.

623
00:55:00,537 --> 00:55:03,438
And we'll have that candlelight
procession in about an hour.

624
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:07,204
So if you hurry,
you can still make it.

625
00:55:07,244 --> 00:55:08,711
The Coast Guard
dropped me a note.

626
00:55:08,745 --> 00:55:11,805
They found the ''Sea Grass''
earlier this afternoon...

627
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:13,338
but there's no further word...

628
00:55:13,383 --> 00:55:17,218
as to the condition of the ship
or the men on-board.

629
00:55:17,255 --> 00:55:20,588
I'll keep you posted
as the news comes in to me.

630
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:23,458
Hope no one else gets lost
out there in the fog.

631
00:55:27,698 --> 00:55:29,256
I'll be right back.

632
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:40,571
Hello. My name's Nick Castle.

633
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:42,409
You don't know me,
but I'm one of the men...

634
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:44,347
who found the ''Sea Grass''
this afternoon.

635
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,681
I'm sorry.
I don't have any further word.

636
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,084
I understand.
That's not what I called about.

637
00:55:49,121 --> 00:55:52,852
You just mentioned something
now on the radio about the fog.

638
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:06,196
This is going to sound
a little strange, but...

639
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,139
I saw the fog last night...

640
00:56:08,174 --> 00:56:09,698
out in the ocean
in the distance.

641
00:56:09,742 --> 00:56:12,540
It was...glowing.

642
00:56:18,686 --> 00:56:19,812
What seemed to be happening...

643
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:21,879
is that the wind
was moving due east...

644
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:24,220
and the fog
just kept moving west.

645
00:56:24,258 --> 00:56:25,782
I know that sounds
completely crazy.

646
00:56:25,826 --> 00:56:27,259
Right now it doesn't.

647
00:56:27,294 --> 00:56:29,455
Something happened last night.

648
00:56:29,496 --> 00:56:31,225
At the same time
that fog was moving in...

649
00:56:31,265 --> 00:56:33,256
this whole town went unglued.

650
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,767
Hold on.

651
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:41,231
I've got some more
birthday music for you...

652
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:43,141
and a few other surprises.

653
00:56:43,178 --> 00:56:46,443
Then I'll be ready to check in
with the weatherman.

654
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:49,939
And the weatherman will be
ready to check in with you.

655
00:57:00,763 --> 00:57:02,731
-Hello?
-I'm still here.

656
00:57:02,765 --> 00:57:04,096
There's one other thing.

657
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:06,863
It may have nothing
to do with the ''Sea Grass''.

658
00:57:06,903 --> 00:57:08,962
Anything.

659
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:12,736
My son found a piece
of driftwood this morning.

660
00:57:18,582 --> 00:57:21,813
Hey, Mel. How you doing?

661
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:25,049
Your girlfriend on the radio
has been talking about you.

662
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:27,056
I came in tonight
just to keep her happy.

663
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,682
I thought
you were off tonight.

664
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:29,885
I love my job.

665
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:33,226
You can tell them all
about that big fog bank...

666
00:57:33,263 --> 00:57:34,924
moving in
the southeast there.

667
00:57:34,965 --> 00:57:37,560
-Where?
-You'll see it.

668
00:57:37,602 --> 00:57:39,570
I'm on my way.
See you tomorrow.

669
00:57:39,604 --> 00:57:41,595
Yeah, Mel. I'll see you.

670
00:57:51,482 --> 00:57:53,006
There you are.

671
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:04,620
I've got to make a run
out to the lighthouse...

672
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:06,187
at Spivey Point.
Want to come?

673
00:58:06,231 --> 00:58:07,493
-Sure.
-Come on.

674
00:58:13,238 --> 00:58:14,637
Hi, sweetheart!

675
00:58:14,673 --> 00:58:15,901
I thought you were celebrating.

676
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:18,740
I couldn't spend an evening
without you.

677
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:21,440
I'm up in about thirty seconds.
What's new?

678
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:23,642
Another fog bank.

679
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:25,116
Where?

680
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,415
It's coming in off the ocean
from the southeast.

681
00:58:27,454 --> 00:58:29,217
It's heading inland.
It should be here...

682
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,950
at the weather station
in ten minutes.

683
00:58:30,991 --> 00:58:33,551
Dan, hold on.

684
00:58:34,894 --> 00:58:36,953
I have a special
weather bulletin.

685
00:58:36,998 --> 00:58:38,556
The tri-county
weather station...

686
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:41,966
reports a fog bank moving
southeast along the coast.

687
00:58:42,003 --> 00:58:43,698
For whoever's interested...

688
00:58:43,738 --> 00:58:47,071
that's the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

689
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:51,101
Repeating--a fog bank is moving
southwest along the coast...

690
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:54,273
toward the weather station
on Old Russellville Road.

691
00:58:59,087 --> 00:59:00,918
Dan, are you still there?

692
00:59:00,956 --> 00:59:03,254
I'm still here.

693
00:59:03,291 --> 00:59:05,316
You sound different tonight...

694
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,385
kind of intense.

695
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:10,057
I just feel like talking,
that's all.

696
00:59:10,098 --> 00:59:12,396
You told me you didn't like
to talk on the telephone...

697
00:59:12,434 --> 00:59:14,231
because you talked
on the radio all day.

698
00:59:14,269 --> 00:59:15,463
Dan, where's the fog now?

699
00:59:15,504 --> 00:59:18,406
It should be
right outside my door now.

700
00:59:21,577 --> 00:59:23,374
Hold on.
I'm going to try something.

701
00:59:28,951 --> 00:59:30,145
I can see it.

702
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:32,916
Now, what is the big deal?

703
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:35,014
You've seen fog once,
you seen it for life.

704
00:59:35,058 --> 00:59:37,083
There's something
different about this fog.

705
00:59:37,126 --> 00:59:39,925
It glows.
Can't you see anything yet?

706
00:59:39,963 --> 00:59:43,421
Glows? Oh, I get it.

707
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:45,435
You take something
to keep you going, right?

708
00:59:45,469 --> 00:59:48,131
Does it make you feel
a little weird sometimes?

709
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:52,104
-Hey.
-What?

710
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,110
The lights went out.

711
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:57,443
Everything's going crazy.

712
00:59:57,481 --> 00:59:59,882
Barometer's falling,
temperature's dropping.

713
00:59:59,918 --> 01:00:01,886
Dan, what is it?

714
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,319
What the hell's that?

715
01:00:03,354 --> 01:00:05,049
Dan, what is it?
What's happening?

716
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:07,558
What is it?
What's happening?

717
01:00:07,592 --> 01:00:10,060
Someone's shining a light
through the window.

718
01:00:10,095 --> 01:00:11,392
Dan, listen to me.

719
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:14,262
Hold on, sweetheart.
I want to check this out.

720
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:20,231
Dan, stay on the phone!

721
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:33,584
This has got to be a joke.

722
01:00:38,557 --> 01:00:41,083
Someone's at the front door,
sweetheart...

723
01:00:41,128 --> 01:00:42,993
playing a stupid joke.

724
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:45,725
And whoever it is...

725
01:00:45,765 --> 01:00:48,063
they ain't gonna like
finding me home.

726
01:00:48,101 --> 01:00:49,898
Dan, stay away from the door!

727
01:01:06,787 --> 01:01:08,084
Anybody here?

728
01:01:11,592 --> 01:01:13,890
Some asshole got drunk
and started taking...

729
01:01:13,928 --> 01:01:16,692
this 100-year-old business
too seriously.

730
01:02:09,653 --> 01:02:13,714
And so all of us living here
in Antonio Bay today...

731
01:02:13,757 --> 01:02:15,884
owe a great debt
of gratitude...

732
01:02:15,926 --> 01:02:18,360
to those men and women
a hundred years ago...

733
01:02:18,395 --> 01:02:21,559
who struggled and sacrificed
to make this town grow...

734
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,295
into what it is today.

735
01:02:23,335 --> 01:02:27,795
And it's up to us to keep
their kind of spirit alive.

736
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:34,005
I have an urgent bulletin.

737
01:02:34,045 --> 01:02:37,776
Will Sheriff David Simms please
contact KAB Radio immediately?

738
01:02:37,816 --> 01:02:40,877
The number is 555-2131.

739
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,649
This is an emergency.

740
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:49,158
So we must redouble our efforts,
work together.

741
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:51,720
We have a vital,
thriving community.

742
01:02:51,764 --> 01:02:54,232
And I say
we have to keep it that way.

743
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,304
This is an emergency.

744
01:02:59,338 --> 01:03:02,797
Sheriff David Simms,
please contact KAB immediately.

745
01:03:02,843 --> 01:03:06,574
555-2131.
This is an emergency.

746
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:22,923
Sheriff Simms?

747
01:03:28,903 --> 01:03:30,734
And so, as we make our way...

748
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:32,433
to the presentation
of the statue...

749
01:03:32,473 --> 01:03:34,771
I think we should all
keep in mind...

750
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:36,401
the significance
of this night...

751
01:03:36,444 --> 01:03:38,776
for every citizen
of Antonio Bay.

752
01:04:26,997 --> 01:04:30,763
We should all proceed
over to the statue.

753
01:04:30,801 --> 01:04:32,860
Single file. Don't push.

754
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:34,495
Take your time.

755
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:02,701
Start!

756
01:05:02,735 --> 01:05:04,726
Please start!

757
01:05:09,108 --> 01:05:10,871
Why did all the lights go out?

758
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:15,847
One of the lines
are probably down, Andy.

759
01:05:15,882 --> 01:05:19,579
They usually take care
of these things right away.

760
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:22,315
I think it's kind of neat.

761
01:05:49,617 --> 01:05:51,482
What's that now?

762
01:06:08,037 --> 01:06:09,561
Start!

763
01:06:15,311 --> 01:06:17,711
Andy! Andy,
get out of the house!

764
01:06:17,746 --> 01:06:20,078
Mrs. Kobritz, get him
out of the house! Please! Run!

765
01:06:20,115 --> 01:06:23,050
I think maybe we better
close all the windows, Andy.

766
01:06:23,085 --> 01:06:24,781
Are your bedroom windows
closed?

767
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:26,083
I'll go see.

768
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:37,399
Someone listen to me!
My son is trapped!

769
01:06:37,434 --> 01:06:40,403
887 White Beach Lane!
My son is trapped by the fog!

770
01:06:40,437 --> 01:06:42,735
Andy, get out of the house!
Run!

771
01:06:47,278 --> 01:06:50,304
Wow! Look at that!

772
01:06:50,348 --> 01:06:52,111
Are your windows all closed?

773
01:06:52,149 --> 01:06:53,480
Yes, ma'am.

774
01:06:53,518 --> 01:06:55,076
What about
your mother's bedroom?

775
01:07:06,832 --> 01:07:09,892
Please, someone!
My son is trapped!

776
01:07:12,471 --> 01:07:14,371
Andy, run! Run!

777
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,670
Mrs. Kobritz, run!

778
01:07:19,711 --> 01:07:22,509
Andy, I want you
to go to your room.

779
01:07:22,548 --> 01:07:24,106
I think I should stay.

780
01:07:24,149 --> 01:07:26,516
-Right now.
-Yes.

781
01:07:47,575 --> 01:07:48,803
Go to your room.

782
01:07:48,842 --> 01:07:50,503
I want to see who it is.

783
01:07:51,912 --> 01:07:53,937
Can't I stay
for two more seconds?

784
01:07:56,917 --> 01:07:59,545
OK, I'm going.

785
01:08:13,401 --> 01:08:15,392
Mrs. Kobritz?

786
01:08:25,448 --> 01:08:27,780
Please. My son is trapped!

787
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:31,719
887 White Beach Lane.

788
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:34,348
Someone get
to 887 White Beach Lane.

789
01:08:47,104 --> 01:08:50,904
My son is trapped!
Get him out of the fog!

790
01:08:57,614 --> 01:08:59,605
Please, someone!

791
01:09:00,884 --> 01:09:02,442
My son is trapped!

792
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,296
Come on!
Get out of there, now!

793
01:09:22,173 --> 01:09:24,869
Andy, run! Run!

794
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:29,344
Come on! Come on.

795
01:09:29,381 --> 01:09:31,144
Go! Go!

796
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:44,691
Come on!

797
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:47,996
Don't pop it.
Try to ease it out.

798
01:09:48,034 --> 01:09:49,592
Oh, Jesus.

799
01:09:55,675 --> 01:09:57,233
Come on, baby!

800
01:09:57,277 --> 01:10:00,735
Come on. It'll go.

801
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,940
Reverse! Reverse!

802
01:10:01,981 --> 01:10:03,414
Come on!

803
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:12,323
Come on, do it! Do it!

804
01:10:37,285 --> 01:10:39,310
...Stevie Wayne
for the last twenty minutes.

805
01:10:39,521 --> 01:10:41,785
I think it's best
we call it a night here.

806
01:10:41,823 --> 01:10:43,290
Another five or ten minutes...

807
01:10:43,325 --> 01:10:45,122
everyone will have
seen the statue.

808
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,629
All right, but let's get them
through as quickly as we can.

809
01:10:47,663 --> 01:10:50,131
Probably be a good idea
if you went home, Kathy.

810
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:51,793
We can close up here.

811
01:10:51,834 --> 01:10:53,131
I should see it through
to the end.

812
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:55,467
Mrs. Williams,
there's nothing more to do here.

813
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:57,871
Let me take you home.

814
01:10:57,907 --> 01:11:00,740
A little annoying,
but you're right.

815
01:11:00,777 --> 01:11:02,904
-Would you please take me?
-Yes, ma'am.

816
01:11:02,945 --> 01:11:05,607
-I'll call you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

817
01:11:10,354 --> 01:11:12,720
Andy, I don't even know
if you can hear me.

818
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:14,849
I'm sorry that
I didn't come for you...

819
01:11:14,892 --> 01:11:16,052
that I wasn't there.

820
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:19,952
Andy, please understand.

821
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:24,632
I have to stay here.

822
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:39,846
The fog is moving inland...

823
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:41,784
away from the beach...

824
01:11:44,389 --> 01:11:46,323
towards Antonio Bay.

825
01:11:52,298 --> 01:11:54,459
It's over by the armory.

826
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,230
I can't remember the name.

827
01:11:57,269 --> 01:12:00,067
No, no--
I think it's Chestnut.

828
01:12:04,844 --> 01:12:07,904
Feel like listening
to some music?

829
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:10,439
Sure.

830
01:12:10,483 --> 01:12:12,348
It's moving faster now.

831
01:12:12,385 --> 01:12:13,875
Up Regent Avenue.

832
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,911
Up to the end
of Smallhouse Road.

833
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,389
What is that?

834
01:12:20,093 --> 01:12:22,653
It's just hitting
the outskirts of town.

835
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:24,687
Broad Street.

836
01:12:26,132 --> 01:12:28,623
Clay Street.

837
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:56,828
It's moving down 10th Street.

838
01:12:56,865 --> 01:13:00,323
Get inside and lock your doors.
Close your windows.

839
01:13:00,369 --> 01:13:02,599
There's something in the fog.

840
01:13:09,177 --> 01:13:11,510
If you're on the south side
of town, go north.

841
01:13:11,547 --> 01:13:13,515
Stay away from the fog.

842
01:13:21,925 --> 01:13:24,018
Richardsville Pike
up to Beacon Hill...

843
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:26,426
is the only clear road.

844
01:13:26,462 --> 01:13:28,430
Up to the church.

845
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:31,559
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

846
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,844
Now the junction at 101
is cut off.

847
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:45,337
If you can get out of town,
get to the old church.

848
01:13:45,382 --> 01:13:47,282
It's the only place
left to go.

849
01:13:47,318 --> 01:13:50,152
Get to the old church
on Beacon Hill.

850
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:00,127
-It cut us off!
-Where is it?

851
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:01,894
-Right behind us.
-Quick, inside.

852
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:07,065
Come on.

853
01:14:07,105 --> 01:14:08,265
Hurry.

854
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:13,077
Father, is there a basement
or cellar in here?

855
01:14:13,112 --> 01:14:15,137
-We can't hide any longer.
-We have to try!

856
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:17,115
No matter where we go,
it will find us.

857
01:14:21,554 --> 01:14:23,249
Is there a basement
or cellar here?

858
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:25,257
There's a study in back.
I'll show you the way.

859
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:26,724
Come on. Hurry.

860
01:14:26,759 --> 01:14:29,125
Give me that.

861
01:14:58,192 --> 01:15:00,126
The fog is sweeping inland.

862
01:15:01,629 --> 01:15:04,462
It's almost like a wall
across the east end of town.

863
01:15:29,058 --> 01:15:30,923
Blake and his men
have come for us.

864
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,552
-Who's Blake?
-It's in the journal.

865
01:15:32,595 --> 01:15:33,721
-What journal?
-I don't know.

866
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:36,061
-We're cursed.
-What are you talking about?

867
01:15:36,099 --> 01:15:39,296
-Where is the journal?
-It's in there.

868
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,706
Over by the window?

869
01:15:46,743 --> 01:15:49,769
-It can do us no good now.
-It's all we got.

870
01:15:49,813 --> 01:15:51,508
If anything happens,
just lock the door.

871
01:15:51,548 --> 01:15:53,881
Get back. Shut the door.

872
01:16:34,127 --> 01:16:35,321
''Six must die.''

873
01:16:35,361 --> 01:16:36,623
The three men
on the ''Sea Grass''.

874
01:16:36,662 --> 01:16:38,254
And the weatherman is four.

875
01:16:38,297 --> 01:16:39,764
-Mrs. Kobritz.
-Yeah, five.

876
01:16:39,799 --> 01:16:41,266
And one of us makes six.

877
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,927
That's what they want.
They've come back...

878
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:44,596
for the six
original conspirators.

879
01:16:44,637 --> 01:16:46,070
There must be something
in here!

880
01:16:46,105 --> 01:16:47,595
It's me they want.
I am the sixth!

881
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,766
Why would they want you?

882
01:16:48,808 --> 01:16:50,105
Wait, Father.
You didn't read us this.

883
01:16:50,143 --> 01:16:52,111
''Were it possible
to raise the dead...

884
01:16:52,145 --> 01:16:54,444
''I would return Blake's fortune
to him intact...

885
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:57,416
''save the money spent
on these walls that hide it.''

886
01:16:57,451 --> 01:16:59,351
''My fellow conspirators
believe...

887
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:01,377
''that the confiscated fortune
has been stolen...

888
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:04,049
''from them, when in fact,
I am the thief...

889
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,559
''and God's temple
is the tomb of gold.''

890
01:17:06,593 --> 01:17:10,120
''I am the thief,
and God's temple--''

891
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:14,195
Now, wait. Get rid of that.

892
01:17:15,803 --> 01:17:18,363
Get out of the way!

893
01:17:39,495 --> 01:17:42,931
-Give me a hand.
-Andy, stay right there.

894
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:08,318
The gold.

895
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:29,543
He melted down the gold
into this.

896
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:35,484
Somebody help her!

897
01:18:48,634 --> 01:18:50,397
Don't go in there!

898
01:19:31,312 --> 01:19:34,179
Blake, I have your gold.

899
01:19:41,589 --> 01:19:42,749
Blake?

900
01:20:20,831 --> 01:20:22,765
This is your gold, Blake.

901
01:20:22,799 --> 01:20:26,166
My grandfather stole it
from you.

902
01:20:28,205 --> 01:20:31,003
I'm the one
who must answer for it.

903
01:20:43,688 --> 01:20:46,680
I'm the sixth conspirator.

904
01:20:48,693 --> 01:20:51,821
I'm Father Malone.

905
01:20:51,863 --> 01:20:54,024
Take me.

906
01:21:50,391 --> 01:21:52,188
Father Malone!

907
01:24:11,872 --> 01:24:13,237
Look.

908
01:24:23,485 --> 01:24:25,146
It's going away.

909
01:25:01,125 --> 01:25:04,561
I don't know what happened
to Antonio Bay tonight.

910
01:25:04,595 --> 01:25:07,928
Something came out of the fog...

911
01:25:07,965 --> 01:25:10,866
and tried to destroy us.

912
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:13,927
In one moment, it vanished.

913
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:17,463
But if this has been
anything but a nightmare...

914
01:25:17,508 --> 01:25:21,377
and if we don't wake up to find
ourselves safe in our beds...

915
01:25:21,413 --> 01:25:25,179
it could come again.

916
01:25:25,216 --> 01:25:28,652
To the ships at sea
who can hear my voice...

917
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:32,919
look across the water
into the darkness.

918
01:25:34,325 --> 01:25:36,486
Look for the fog.

919
01:26:04,991 --> 01:26:08,119
Why not six, Blake?

920
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:12,723
Why not me?

921
01:26:13,305 --> 01:26:19,848
