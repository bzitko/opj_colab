00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,910
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

3
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,912
My name is Jack Torrance.

4
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,594
His office is the first door
on the left.

5
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,955
Thank you.

6
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,396
Mr. Ullman?

7
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,789
I'm Jack Torrance.

8
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,917
Come on in, Jack.

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,355
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

10
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,079
This is my secretary, Susie.

11
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,835
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

12
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,719
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

13
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,791
That's very good time.

14
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,639
Sit down a minute, Jack.

15
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,552
Just make yourself at home.

16
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,949
Like some coffee?

17
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,555
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

18
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,676
-Susie.
-Sure.

19
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,512
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

20
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,193
Yes, I will.

21
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,675
Mom?

22
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,595
Yeah?

23
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,470
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

24
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,308
Sure I do.

25
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,437
It'll be lots of fun.

26
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,231
Yeah. I guess so.

27
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,473
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

28
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,590
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

29
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,275
Yeah, I guess so.

30
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,995
What about Tony?

31
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,435
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

32
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,315
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

33
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,955
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

34
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,237
I don't want to go there.

35
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,671
How come you don't want to go?

36
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,757
I just don't.

37
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,799
Did they give you
any idea in Denver...

38
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,598
...about what the job entails?

39
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,831
Only in a very general way.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,514
The winters can be
fantastically cruel.

41
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,991
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

42
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,071
...and depreciation
which can occur.

43
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,629
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

44
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,634
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

45
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,440
...repairing damage as it occurs...

46
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,353
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

47
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,550
That sounds fine to me.

48
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,718
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

49
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,952
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

50
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,668
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

51
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,191
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

52
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,552
I'm outlining a new
writing project.

53
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,071
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

54
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,512
That's very good, Jack.

55
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,792
Because, for some people...

56
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,678
...solitude...

57
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,433
...and isolation...

58
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,430
...can, of itself, become a problem.

59
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,792
Not for me.

60
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,317
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

61
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,149
They'll love it.

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,594
Great.

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,432
Before I turn you over to Bill...

64
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,956
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

65
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,553
Not to sound melodramatic...

66
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,189
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

67
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,510
...second thoughts about the job.

68
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,758
I'm intrigued.

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,195
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

70
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,194
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,677
I don't believe they did.

72
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,792
My predecessor in this job...

73
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,632
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

74
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,156
He came up with his wife and
2 little girls of about 8 and 10.

75
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,278
He had a good employment record,
good references.

76
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,636
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

77
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,440
...like a completely
normal individual.

78
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,875
But at some point
during the winter...

79
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,590
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

80
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,035
He ran amuck...

81
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,390
...and killed his family
with an ax.

82
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,071
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

83
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,395
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

84
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,312
The police thought...

85
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,394
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

86
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,518
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

87
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,719
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

88
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,874
That is...

89
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,553
...quite a story.

90
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,239
Yeah, it is.

91
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,511
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,392
But it did.

93
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,999
I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

94
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,875
I certainly can.

95
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,828
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

96
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,196
...left it for you to tell me.

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,920
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

98
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,039
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

99
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,910
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

100
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,630
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

101
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,555
...l'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

102
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,473
She's a confirmed ghost story...

103
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,995
...and horror film addict.

104
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,189
Tony, do you think
Dad'll get the job?

105
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,676
He already did.

106
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,629
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

107
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,320
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, hon. How's it going?

108
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,950
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to do.

109
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,112
I don't think I can get home
before 9 or 10.

110
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,759
Sounds like you got the job.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,560
Right. It's a beautiful place.

112
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,791
You and Danny are going to love it.

113
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,038
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

114
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,952
I don't know.

115
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,350
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

116
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,911
I don't want to.

117
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,794
Please.

118
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,029
No.

119
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,356
Now, Tony, tell me.

120
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,073
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

121
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,629
Dad?

122
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,998
I'm hungry.

123
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,359
You should've eaten your breakfast.

124
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,913
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

125
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,718
Okay, Mom.

126
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,079
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

127
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,110
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

128
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,835
What was the Donner party?

129
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,753
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

130
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,072
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

131
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,359
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

132
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,193
You mean they ate each other up?

133
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,352
They had to, in order to survive.

134
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,749
Jack.

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,989
Don't worry, Mom.

136
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,313
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

137
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,074
See, it's okay.

138
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,595
He saw it on the television.

139
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,798
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

140
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,634
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

141
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,711
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

142
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,918
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

143
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,628
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

144
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,599
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

145
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,432
Is your family
having a look around?

146
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,877
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

147
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,032
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

148
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,431
In view of all we have
to cover today...

149
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,150
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

150
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,039
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

151
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,874
I'd better collect my family first.

152
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,915
This is our Colorado Lounge.

153
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,435
It's beautiful.

154
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,598
My God!

155
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,229
This place is fantastic,
isn't it, hon?

156
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,754
It sure is.

157
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,188
This is the staff wing
of the hotel.

158
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,317
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

159
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,313
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

160
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,391
And here are your quarters.

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,314
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

162
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,994
And a small bedroom for your son.

163
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,356
Perfect for a child.

164
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,436
When was the Overlook built?

165
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,516
Construction started in 1907.

166
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,591
It was finished in 1909.

167
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,308
The site's supposedly
on an Indian burial ground.

168
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,156
They had to repel a few Indian
attacks as they were building it.

169
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,511
That's our Snowcat.

170
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,116
Can you both drive a car?

171
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,076
That's fine. Basically the Snowcat
operates very much like a car.

172
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,912
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

173
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,153
This is the kitchen, huh?

174
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,879
This is it.

175
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,953
How do you like it, Danny?
Is it big enough for you?

176
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,876
It's the biggest place I ever seen.

177
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,270
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

178
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,195
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

179
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,558
Don't let it get you down.

180
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,109
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

181
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,430
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

182
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,796
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

183
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,952
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

184
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,637
You could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

185
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,792
Right here is
our walk-in freezer.

186
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,838
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

187
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,911
You got 15 rib roasts...

188
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,151
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

189
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,278
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

190
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,478
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen pork roast...

191
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,553
...and 20 legs of lamb.
You like lamb, Doc?

192
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,990
You don't?
What's your favorite food?

193
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,037
French fries and ketchup.

194
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,597
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

195
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,398
Come along.
Watch your step.

196
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,398
How'd you know we call him Doc?

197
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,474
-Beg your pardon?
-You called Danny "Doc" twice.

198
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,039
I did?

199
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,798
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

200
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,155
But how did you know?

201
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,834
I guess I heard you
call him that.

202
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,196
It's possible.
But I don't remember...

203
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,510
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

204
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,796
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

205
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,553
What's up, Doc?

206
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,436
Now, this is the storeroom.

207
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,750
In here is where we keep all the
dried goods and the canned goods.

208
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,230
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

209
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,075
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

210
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,312
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

211
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,394
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

212
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,915
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

213
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,197
We got 60 boxes of dried milk...

214
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,875
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

215
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,077
...Sociables, finger rolls...

216
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,713
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

217
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,316
We've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

218
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,472
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

219
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,873
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

220
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,159
-How're you getting on?
-Fine.

221
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,790
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

222
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,792
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

223
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,077
No problem. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

224
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,117
You like ice cream, Doc?

225
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,835
I thought so.

226
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,958
You mind if I give Danny
some ice cream?

227
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,918
-Not at all.
-We don't mind.

228
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,196
-Good.
-Sound good to you, Doc?

229
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,431
Okay, you behave yourself.

230
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,072
What kind of ice cream
do you like?

231
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,116
Chocolate.

232
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,193
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

233
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,471
It's amazing, all this
activity today.

234
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,359
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

235
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,953
...last day's always hectic.

236
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,033
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

237
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,114
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

238
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,316
Just like a ghost ship, huh?

239
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,633
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

240
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,388
You know what
I'm talking about, don't you?

241
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,276
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

242
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,035
...my grandmother and I
could hold conversations...

243
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,989
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

244
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,195
She called it "shining."

245
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,194
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

246
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,954
...that had "the shine" to us.

247
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,438
Like you probably thought
you was the only one.

248
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,872
But there are other folks...

249
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,669
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

250
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,429
How long have you
been able to do it?

251
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,795
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

252
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,791
I'm not supposed to.

253
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,714
Who says you ain't supposed to?

254
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,314
Tony.

255
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,878
Who's Tony?

256
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,431
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

257
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,115
Is Tony the one that
tells you things?

258
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,749
How does he tell you things?

259
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,598
It's like I go to sleep
and he shows me things.

260
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:14,753
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

261
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,029
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

262
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,668
Do they know he tells you things?

263
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,313
Tony told me never to tell them.

264
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,591
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

265
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,274
About the Overlook Hotel?

266
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,879
I don't know.

267
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,314
Now think real hard, Doc.

268
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,549
Think.

269
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,109
Is there something bad here?

270
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,510
You know, Doc,
when something happens...

271
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,275
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

272
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,433
Say, like...

273
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,558
...if someone burns toast.

274
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,156
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

275
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,516
Not things that anyone
can notice.

276
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,390
But things that people
who shine can see.

277
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,551
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

278
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,798
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

279
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,953
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

280
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,715
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

281
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,549
And not all of them was good.

282
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,274
What about Room 237?

283
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,516
Room 237?

284
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,712
You're scared of Room 237,
ain't you?

285
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,873
No, I ain't.

286
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,035
Mr. Hallorann, what is in Room 237?

287
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,548
Nothing.

288
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,032
There ain't nothing in Room 237.

289
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,352
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

290
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,591
So stay out.

291
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,274
You understand? Stay out!

292
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,752
Good morning, hon.

293
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,358
Your breakfast is ready.

294
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,672
What time is it?

295
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,672
It's about 11:30.

296
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,033
Jesus!

297
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,229
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

298
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,913
I know it.

299
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,958
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

300
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,713
Nice.

301
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,598
It's really pretty outside.

302
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,912
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

303
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,672
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

304
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,638
Any ideas yet?

305
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,113
Lots of ideas.

306
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,873
No good ones.

307
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,669
Something will come.

308
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,908
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

309
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,038
That's all it is.

310
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,029
-All right.
-And you're going to lose.

311
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,272
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

312
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,155
Look out!

313
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,118
I'm coming in close.

314
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,794
Loser has to keep America clean.

315
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,519
Keep America clean.

316
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,919
Danny, you win.

317
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,470
Let's take the rest
of this walking.

318
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,279
Give me your hand.

319
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,512
Isn't it beautiful?

320
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,873
Dead end.

321
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,513
We made it.

322
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,189
Isn't it beautiful?

323
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,792
It's so pretty.

324
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,998
I didn't think it was
this big. Did you?

325
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,913
Hi, hon.

326
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,679
How's it going?

327
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,229
Fine.

328
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,753
Get a lot written today?

329
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,034
The weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

330
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,274
What do you want me
to do about it?

331
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,350
Come on, hon.

332
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,636
Don't be so grouchy.

333
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,274
I'm not...

334
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,794
...being grouchy.

335
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,679
I just want to finish my work.

336
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,315
Okay. I understand.

337
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,028
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

338
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,589
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

339
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,715
Wendy...

340
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,428
...let me explain something to you.

341
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,955
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

342
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,519
You're distracting me...

343
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,036
...and it will then take time
to get back to where I was.

344
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,554
Understand?

345
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,115
Fine.

346
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,838
We're making a new rule:

347
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,399
Whenever I'm in here...

348
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,835
...and you hear me typing...

349
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,318
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

350
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,710
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

351
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,076
That means don't come in.

352
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,436
Do you think you can handle that?

353
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,035
Fine.

354
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,151
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

355
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,389
Missed!

356
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,476
Don't have!

357
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,358
No fair anymore.

358
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,628
I knew it.

359
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,996
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1 .

360
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,870
KDK 12 to KDK 1.

361
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,112
This is KDK 1 .
We're receiving you. Over.

362
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,472
This is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

363
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,713
How are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

364
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,274
We're just fine.

365
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,795
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

366
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,918
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

367
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,229
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

368
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,517
Any chance of them
being repaired soon?

369
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,795
Wouldn't like to say.

370
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,396
Most winters they stay that way
until spring.

371
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,071
This storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

372
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,353
It's one of the worst we've
had for years.

373
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,917
Anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

374
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,431
I suppose not. Over.

375
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,191
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

376
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,589
And, Mrs. Torrance?

377
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,879
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

378
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,113
We'll do that.

379
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,271
It was real nice talking to you.

380
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,988
Bye. Over and out.

381
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,596
Hello, Danny.

382
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,995
Come and play with us.

383
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,359
Come and play with us, Danny.

384
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,752
Forever...

385
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,152
...and ever...

386
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,991
...and ever.

387
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,718
Tony...

388
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,636
...l'm scared.

389
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,350
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

390
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,549
"It's just like
pictures in a book, Danny.

391
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,870
It isn't real. "

392
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,032
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

393
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,710
Come here for a minute first.

394
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,957
How's it going, Doc?

395
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,997
Having a good time?

396
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,393
Yes, Dad.

397
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,354
Good.

398
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,550
I want you to
have a good time.

399
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,832
I am, Dad.

400
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,552
Do you feel bad?

401
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,555
I'm just a little bit tired.

402
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,434
Then why don't you go to sleep?

403
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,359
I can't.

404
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,995
I got too much to do.

405
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,070
Do you like this hotel?

406
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,154
I do.

407
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,388
I love it.

408
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,754
Don't you?

409
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,479
I guess so.

410
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,155
Good.

411
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,470
I want you to like it here.

412
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,556
I wish we could stay here
forever...

413
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,472
...and ever...

414
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,394
...and ever.

415
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,595
What?

416
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,832
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

417
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,473
What do you mean?

418
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,874
Did your mother
ever say that to you?

419
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,238
That I would hurt you?

420
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,279
No, Dad.

421
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,918
You sure?

422
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,913
Yes, Dad.

423
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,436
I love you, Danny.

424
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,068
I love you
more than anything else...

425
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,754
...in the whole world.

426
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,438
I would never do anything
to hurt you...

427
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,909
...never.

428
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,751
You know that, don't you?

429
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,718
Yes, Dad.

430
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,675
Good.

431
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,678
Mom, are you in there?

432
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,669
What happened?

433
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,035
Honey...

434
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,239
...what's wrong?

435
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,359
I had the most...

436
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,068
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

437
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,748
-lt was the most horrible dream.
-lt's okay now.

438
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,473
Really.

439
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,833
I dreamed that I...

440
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,389
...that I killed
you and Danny.

441
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,195
But I didn't just kill you.

442
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,073
I cut you up
into little pieces.

443
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,079
My God.

444
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,234
I must be losing my mind.

445
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,960
Everything's going to be
all right.

446
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,673
Come on. Let's get up
off the floor.

447
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,270
There. Now sit up.

448
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,148
It's okay.

449
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,559
It's okay.

450
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,789
Danny!

451
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,951
Everything's okay!

452
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,237
Just go play in your room
for a while.

453
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,476
Your dad's just got
a headache.

454
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,871
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

455
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,318
Honey, let me just
get him out of here.

456
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,039
I'll be right back.

457
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,871
Why don't you mind me?

458
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,952
Oh, my God.

459
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,389
What happened to your neck?

460
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,271
What happened to your neck?

461
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,991
You did this to him...

462
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,713
...didn't you?!

463
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,436
You son of a bitch!

464
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,432
You did this to him!

465
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,079
Didn't you?!

466
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,878
How could you?!

467
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,792
How could you?!

468
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,992
God! I'd give anything
for a drink.

469
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,233
I'd give my goddamn soul...

470
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,869
...for just a glass of beer.

471
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,673
Hi, Lloyd.

472
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,469
A little slow tonight,
isn't it?

473
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,275
Yes it is, Mr. Torrance.

474
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,679
What will it be?

475
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,993
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

476
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,391
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

477
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,359
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

478
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,752
I was afraid they'd
be there until next April.

479
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,152
So here's what:

480
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,675
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

481
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,514
...a little glass and some ice.

482
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,671
You can do that, can't you?

483
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,390
You're not too busy, are you?

484
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,315
No, sir.
I'm not busy at all.

485
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,358
Good man.

486
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,715
You set them up...

487
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,679
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

488
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:00,513
White man's burden,
Lloyd, my man.

489
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,876
White man's burden.

490
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,749
Say, Lloyd...

491
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,594
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

492
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,275
How's my credit
in this joint, anyway?

493
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,795
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

494
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,998
That's swell.

495
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,832
I like you, Lloyd.

496
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,638
I always liked you.

497
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,075
You were always the best of them.

498
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,470
Best goddamn bartender...

499
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,518
...from Timbuktu
to Portland, Maine.

500
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,876
Or Portland, Oregon,
for that matter.

501
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:35,792
Thank you for saying so.

502
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,957
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

503
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,713
I didn't.

504
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,991
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

505
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,592
I love the little son of a bitch.

506
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,793
I'd do anything for him.

507
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,713
Any fucking thing for him.

508
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,035
But that bitch!

509
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,678
As long as I live...

510
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,230
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

511
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,159
I did hurt him once, okay?

512
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,471
It was an accident.

513
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,274
Completely unintentional.

514
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,590
It could have happened
to anybody.

515
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,596
And it was three goddamn
years ago!

516
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,479
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

517
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,109
All I tried to do was pull him up.

518
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,271
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

519
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,714
I mean...

520
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,590
...a few extra foot-pounds
of energy...

521
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,513
...per second, per second!

522
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,797
Thank God you're here.

523
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,990
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

524
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,629
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

525
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,314
She tried to strangle Danny.

526
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,990
Are you out of your fucking mind?

527
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,959
It's the truth. I swear it!
Danny told me.

528
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,077
He went up into
one of the bedrooms.

529
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,551
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

530
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,030
She tried to strangle him!

531
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,312
Which room was it?

532
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,596
From Channel 10 in Miami...

533
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,070
...this is Newswatch
with Glen Rinker...

534
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,393
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

535
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,955
Good evening. I'm Glen Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

536
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,192
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

537
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,396
...bringing temperatures
to the 90s...

538
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,598
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

539
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,628
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.

540
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,996
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

541
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:37,038
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

542
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,077
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

543
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:40,958
Railroad tracks are frozen.

544
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,077
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

545
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,676
...at least 3 have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

546
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,115
The governor of Colorado
is expected...

547
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,918
...to declare
a weather emergency.

548
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,912
The National Guard
might be called out...

549
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,229
...to clear roads.

550
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,550
Forecasters
predict more snow...

551
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,677
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

552
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,428
... with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

553
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,513
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

554
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,830
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

555
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,957
Local beaches
should be jammed.

556
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,111
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

557
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,432
... will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

558
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,911
We're sorry. Your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

559
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,272
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

560
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,518
Yes, it's me.

561
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,159
Thank God.

562
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,272
Did you find anything?

563
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,159
No. Nothing at all.

564
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,717
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

565
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,670
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

566
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,399
Yes, I did.

567
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,552
And you didn't see anything at all?

568
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,677
Absolutely nothing.

569
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,114
How is he?

570
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,032
He's still asleep.

571
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,509
Good.

572
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,038
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

573
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,669
Are you sure it was the right room?

574
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,957
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

575
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,395
He must have gone in that room.

576
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:53,234
The door was open,
the lights were on.

577
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,950
I just don't understand it.

578
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,038
What about those bruises
on his neck?

579
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,390
Somebody did that to him.

580
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,633
I think...

581
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,714
...he did it to himself.

582
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,674
No.

583
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,271
That's not possible.

584
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,836
Once you rule out his version
of what happened...

585
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,594
...there is no other explanation.

586
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,359
Is there?

587
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,358
Whatever the explanation is...

588
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,073
...I think we...

589
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,880
...have to get Danny out of here.

590
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,232
Get him out of here?

591
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,878
You mean...

592
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,757
...just leave the hotel?

593
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,753
It is so...

594
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,275
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

595
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,909
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

596
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:34,549
When I'm really into my work!

597
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,554
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

598
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:42,315
Shoveling out driveways,
working in a car wash.

599
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,551
Any of that appeal to you?

600
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,314
I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

601
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:52,269
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

602
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,070
Good evening. Forest Service.

603
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,919
My name is Dick Hallorann.

604
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,435
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

605
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,671
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

606
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,356
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

607
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,558
...but the operator said
the phone lines are down.

608
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:20,190
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

609
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,908
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

610
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,197
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

611
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,998
And with this storm
and everything...

612
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,993
...l'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

613
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,117
...just to see if
everything's okay.

614
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,828
I'll be glad to do that.

615
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,719
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

616
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,871
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

617
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,473
All right, sir.

618
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,791
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

619
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:04,473
Good evening.

620
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,353
Hi, Lloyd.

621
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,397
Been away, but now I'm back.

622
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,312
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

623
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:34,870
It's good to see you.

624
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:37,634
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

625
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,918
What'll it be, sir?

626
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,830
Hair of the dog that bit me.

627
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,792
Bourbon on the rocks.

628
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,999
That'll do her.

629
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,110
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

630
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,351
No charge?

631
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,911
Your money's no good here.

632
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,998
Orders from the house.

633
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,395
Orders from the house.

634
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,431
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

635
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:33,236
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks.

636
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,913
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

637
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,991
At least not at this point.

638
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,909
Anything you say, Lloyd.

639
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,276
Anything you say.

640
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,069
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

641
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,473
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

642
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,188
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

643
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,830
That's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

644
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,719
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

645
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:17,995
Advocaat, is it?

646
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,231
Yes, sir.
I think the best thing...

647
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,516
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

648
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,228
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

649
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,117
Looks like you got a
spot of it on yourself...

650
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,315
...Jeevesy old boy.

651
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:33,552
That doesn't matter.
You're the important one.

652
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,149
Awfully nice of you to say.

653
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,279
Of course, I intended
to change my jacket...

654
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,670
...before the fish and
goose soiree.

655
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,797
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

656
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,189
I'll just...

657
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:48,230
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

658
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:50,198
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

659
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,596
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water.

660
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,989
All right. I'll just...

661
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:00,313
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

662
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:02,199
Won't keep you a moment.

663
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,714
Fine.

664
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,232
What do they call you around here?

665
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,948
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

666
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,276
Grady?

667
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,748
Yes, sir.

668
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:20,148
Delbert Grady.

669
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:21,833
That's right, sir.

670
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,553
Mr. Grady...

671
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,311
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

672
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,074
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

673
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,592
It's coming off now, sir.

674
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,833
Mr. Grady...

675
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,589
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

676
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:58,513
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

677
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,591
You a married man, are you,
Mr. Grady?

678
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,833
Yes, sir. I have a wife
and two daughters.

679
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,433
And...

680
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,195
...where are they now?

681
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:18,353
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

682
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,909
You were the caretaker here.

683
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,191
I recognize you.

684
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,478
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

685
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,592
You...

686
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,430
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

687
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,234
And...

688
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,035
...then you blew your brains out.

689
01:08:58,240 --> 01:08:59,958
That's strange, sir.

690
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:03,832
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

691
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,792
Mr. Grady...

692
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,437
...you were the caretaker here.

693
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:22,554
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

694
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,072
But you...

695
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,472
...are the caretaker.

696
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,478
You've always been the caretaker.

697
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,152
I should know, sir.

698
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,000
I've always been here.

699
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,516
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

700
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:03,432
...that your son...

701
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,400
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

702
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:08,710
...into this situation?

703
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,832
Did you know that?

704
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,836
He is, Mr. Torrance.

705
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,189
Who?

706
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,878
A nigger.

707
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,153
A nigger?

708
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,399
A nigger cook.

709
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,834
How?

710
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,718
Your son...

711
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,833
...has a very great talent.

712
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,150
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

713
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,917
But he is attempting to use
that talent...

714
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,037
...against your will.

715
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,389
Well...

716
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,032
...he is a very willful boy.

717
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,555
Indeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

718
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,553
A very willful boy.

719
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,074
A rather...

720
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:28,673
...naughty boy...

721
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,037
...if I may be so bold, sir.

722
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,638
It's his mother.

723
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,079
She...

724
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,197
...interferes.

725
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,158
Perhaps they need a good...

726
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,879
...talking-to.

727
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,477
If you don't mind my saying so...

728
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:00,278
...perhaps...

729
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,438
...a bit more.

730
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,629
My girls, sir...

731
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,509
...they didn't care for the Overlook
at first.

732
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,989
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

733
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,754
...and tried to burn it down.

734
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,392
But I...

735
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,517
...corrected them, sir.

736
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:27,673
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

737
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,148
...l...

738
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,156
...corrected her.

739
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,313
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

740
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,312
Are you receiving me?

741
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,716
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

742
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,679
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

743
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,558
Do you read me?

744
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,598
This is KDK 1 calling
KDK 12.

745
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,274
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

746
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,158
Are you receiving me?

747
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:58,117
You're with Hal and Charlie
on KHOW, Denver.

748
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,828
And we have a bad day out there.

749
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,231
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

750
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,879
Many mountain passes...

751
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,793
... Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

752
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,157
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

753
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,958
We hear from the news department...

754
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,192
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

755
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:18,953
...and with storms like this...

756
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,079
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

757
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,039
The storm will continue
and the Weather Service...

758
01:14:26,280 --> 01:14:28,589
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

759
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,434
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

760
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,718
How do you like it?

761
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,553
How do you like it?

762
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,634
What are you doing down here?

763
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,030
I just...

764
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:45,509
...wanted...

765
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:47,558
...to talk to you.

766
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,034
Okay.

767
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,039
Let's talk.

768
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:04,391
What do you want to talk about?

769
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,997
I can't really remember.

770
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,796
You can't remember.

771
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:19,828
No...

772
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:21,553
...I can't.

773
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,757
Maybe it was about Danny?

774
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:34,679
Maybe it was about him.

775
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,317
I think we should discuss Danny.

776
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,718
I think...

777
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,709
... we should discuss
what should be done with him.

778
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,714
What should be done with him?

779
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,192
I don't know.

780
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:05,557
I don't think that's true.

781
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,314
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

782
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,118
...about what should be done
with Danny.

783
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,749
And I'd like to know
what they are.

784
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,392
Well, I...

785
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,838
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

786
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,197
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

787
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:29,511
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

788
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:31,433
As soon as possible?

789
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:34,190
"As soon as possible?"

790
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,159
Please.

791
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,597
You believe his health
might be at stake.

792
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,639
Yes.

793
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,440
And you are concerned about him.

794
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,996
And are you concerned about me?

795
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:55,915
Of course I am.

796
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,276
Of course you are!

797
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,478
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

798
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,073
What are you talking about?

799
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:08,189
Have you ever had a single moment's
thought about my responsibilities?

800
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,556
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

801
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,439
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?

802
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,398
Has is ever occurred to you...

803
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,996
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1st?

804
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,157
Does it matter to you at all...

805
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,358
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

806
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,512
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

807
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,274
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

808
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,591
Do you have the slightest idea...

809
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,912
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?

810
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,232
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

811
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,710
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

812
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,155
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?

813
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:45,799
Stay away from me!

814
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,675
Why?

815
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:50,758
I just want to go back to my room.

816
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,228
Why?

817
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:53,636
Well...

818
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,716
...l'm very confused.

819
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:01,315
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

820
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:06,074
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

821
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,914
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

822
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,319
Stay away from me!

823
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:12,828
Please!

824
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,589
Don't hurt me.

825
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,068
I'm not going to hurt you.

826
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,389
Stay away from me!

827
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,436
Stay away!

828
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:19,556
Darling...

829
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,358
...light of my life.

830
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,994
I'm not going to hurt you.

831
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:25,117
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

832
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,396
I said,
"I'm not going to hurt you."

833
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:30,313
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

834
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:33,358
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

835
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,873
Stay away from me!

836
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,355
Don't hurt me!

837
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,875
I'm not going to hurt you.

838
01:21:40,280 --> 01:21:41,679
Stay away from me!

839
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,955
Stay away!

840
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:44,949
Please!

841
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:47,632
Stop swinging the bat.

842
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,074
Stay away from me.

843
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,028
Put that bat down, Wendy.

844
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,679
Stop it!

845
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:55,149
Give me the bat.

846
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,435
Please!

847
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,750
-Stay away!
-Give me the bat.

848
01:21:59,000 --> 01:21:59,989
Stop it!

849
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,599
Give me the bat.

850
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,478
-Stay away from me.
-Stop swinging the bat.

851
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,948
Please stop!

852
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,349
Give me the bat.

853
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,715
Stay away from me.

854
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,275
-Stop it!
-Give me the bat.

855
01:22:11,640 --> 01:22:12,595
Goddamn...!

856
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,438
What are you doing?

857
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:30,519
Wait a minute.

858
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,751
What are you doing?

859
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,669
What are you doing?

860
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,479
Wait a minute!

861
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:56,273
What are you doing?

862
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,112
Open the door!

863
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,349
Goddamn it!

864
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,990
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

865
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,754
Wendy, listen.

866
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,918
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole thing.

867
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,515
It'll be just like
nothing ever happened.

868
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,914
Baby...

869
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,271
...I think you hurt my head
real bad.

870
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,398
I'm dizzy.

871
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,470
I need a doctor.

872
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,155
Honey...

873
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,950
Don't leave me in here.

874
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,032
I'm going to go now.

875
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,718
I'm going to try...

876
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:10,838
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

877
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,755
...in the Snowcat today.

878
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,672
I'll bring back a doctor.

879
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,637
I'm going to go now.

880
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:35,389
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

881
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,360
You're not going anywhere.

882
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:45,118
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

883
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,912
Go check it out.

884
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,076
Go check it out!

885
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,151
Go check it out.

886
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,029
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

887
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,597
Delbert Grady.

888
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:51,678
Grady?

889
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,912
Hello, Grady.

890
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,158
Mr. Torrance...

891
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,152
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the business...

892
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,038
...we discussed.

893
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:37,038
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

894
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,799
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

895
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,240
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

896
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,517
I wonder.

897
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,676
I have my doubts.

898
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,793
l, and others, have come
to believe...

899
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,952
...that your heart is not in this.

900
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,949
That you haven't the belly for it.

901
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,993
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

902
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,671
That's all I ask.

903
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:20,193
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

904
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,839
Somewhat more...

905
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,911
...resourceful.

906
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,799
She seems to have got
the better of you.

907
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,514
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

908
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,270
Only for the moment.

909
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:41,073
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

910
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,909
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

911
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,913
I fear...

912
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:49,628
...that is the only thing to do.

913
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,916
There's nothing
I look forward to...

914
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,914
...with greater pleasure,
Mr. Grady.

915
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:02,913
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

916
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,236
I give you my word.

917
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,068
Redrum.

918
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:21,394
Redrum.

919
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:25,639
Danny, stop it!

920
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:21,039
I'm home.

921
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,878
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

922
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:26,112
I can't get out!

923
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:27,989
Run!

924
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,153
Run and hide!

925
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:31,749
Run!

926
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,149
Quick!

927
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:38,958
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me come in.

928
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:47,911
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin.

929
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,351
Then I'll huff...

930
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,238
...and I'll puff...

931
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,396
...and I'll blow your house in!

932
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:11,039
Please!

933
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,432
Don't!

934
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,559
Don't!

935
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:34,549
Stop it!

936
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,039
Here's Johnny!

937
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,515
Hello?

938
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:23,432
Anybody here?

939
01:39:44,640 --> 01:39:46,119
Hello?

940
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,672
Anybody here?

941
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:30,311
Anybody here?

942
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:11,278
Danny-boy!

943
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,397
I'm coming!

944
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,591
I'm coming, Dan!

945
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,355
Great party, isn't it?

946
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:11,475
I'm coming!

947
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,115
You can't get away!

948
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,229
I'm right behind you!

949
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,711
-Mommy!
-Danny, come here!

950
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,512
Mommy.

951
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:52,839
Where...?

952
01:48:53,305 --> 01:48:59,373
