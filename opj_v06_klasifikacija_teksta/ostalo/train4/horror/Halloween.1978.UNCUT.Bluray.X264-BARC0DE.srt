1
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:27,064
Black cats and goblins and broomsticks and ghosts.

2
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,650
Pumpkins of witches are there to roast.

3
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:34,154
You may think, they scare me. You're probably right.

4
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,157
Black cats and goblins on Halloween night.

5
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,868
Trick-or-treat!!!

6
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,058
My parents won't be home untill ten.
- Are you sure?

7
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:14,278
We're all alone, aren't we?

8
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,072
Michael's around someplace ...

9
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,242
Take off that thing.

10
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,663
Let's go upstairs.
- Ok.

11
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,745
Look, Judith, it's very late.

12
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,080
I gotta go.

13
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,666
Will you call me tomorrow?

14
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,376
Yeah, sure.
- Promise?

15
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,378
Yeah.

16
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,446
Michael?

17
00:06:44,277 --> 00:06:45,779
Michael?

18
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:02,563
Ever done anything like this before?

19
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,650
Only minimum security.

20
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,443
I see.

21
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,949
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on the right.

22
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,870
The only thing that ever bothers me is their jibberish.

23
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:21,541
When they start raving on and on ...

24
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:24,252
You haven't anything to worry about.

25
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:28,047
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

26
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:30,758
Are there any special instructions?

27
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:34,178
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here.

28
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,262
Don't underestimate it.

29
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:39,266
Don't you think we could refer to 'it' as him?

30
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:41,769
If you say so.

31
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:45,439
Your compassion's overwhelming, Doctor.

32
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,241
What do I give him,
when we're taking him in front of the judge?

33
00:08:56,075 --> 00:08:57,243
Thorazin.

34
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:02,248
Barely be able to sit up.
- That's the idea.

35
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,176
You're serious about that, aren't you?

36
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:15,552
Yeah.

37
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:22,059
You mean, you actually never want him to get out.
- Never ever ...

38
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:23,644
Never.

39
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:29,149
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,
if he just gonna ... - Because that is the law.

40
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:31,944
We are.

41
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,869
Since when do they let them wander around?

42
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:45,666
Pull up to the main gate.
- Shouldn't we ... - Pull up?

43
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:56,551
Stop here.

44
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:03,266
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ...
- Wait!

45
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:03,575
Are you all right?

46
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:07,245
You all right?
- Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

47
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:08,873
The evil is gone!

48
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,338
I gotta ...

49
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:17,066
Don't forget to drop the key off the Myers place ...

50
00:12:17,566 --> 00:12:18,941
I won't.

51
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:23,947
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.
Be sure you leave it under the mat ... - Promise.

52
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:58,440
Laurie ...

53
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:01,777
Hi Tommy.

54
00:13:04,237 --> 00:13:07,073
Coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

55
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:09,075
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
- Sure.

56
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:11,243
And watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

57
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:12,537
Will you read to me?

58
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:15,665
Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

59
00:13:18,376 --> 00:13:19,753
You better hurry up.

60
00:13:21,254 --> 00:13:24,548
How can you walk in the school this way?
- My dad asked me to.

61
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:25,758
Why?

62
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,177
I have to drop off the key.

63
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:28,260
Why?

64
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:29,762
Because he's gonna sell a house.

65
00:13:29,763 --> 00:13:30,971
Why?

66
00:13:30,972 --> 00:13:33,058
Because that's his job.
- Where?

67
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:34,476
The Meyers house.

68
00:13:34,477 --> 00:13:36,144
The Meyers house!

69
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,946
You're not supposed to go up there?

70
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:48,364
Yes, I am.

71
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:51,367
That's a spook house.

72
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,244
Just watch.

73
00:14:02,837 --> 00:14:05,340
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

74
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,258
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

75
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:13,139
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
- Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.

76
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,556
I gotta go.

77
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:15,767
I see you tonight.

78
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:17,643
Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:25,735
# I wish I had you all alone ... #

80
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:29,238
# Just the two of us ... #

81
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,244
# I would hold you close to me ... #

82
00:14:36,037 --> 00:14:38,873
# So close to me ... #

83
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:44,170
# Just the two ... #

84
00:14:46,047 --> 00:14:48,548
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

85
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:49,759
I told them how dangerous he was!

86
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,470
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks
and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

87
00:14:53,471 --> 00:14:56,557
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions
weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

88
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:58,058
I told everybody!

89
00:14:58,059 --> 00:14:59,641
Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

90
00:14:59,642 --> 00:15:01,935
You can get back in there
and get back on the telephone.

91
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:04,064
Tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night ...

92
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:06,649
And tell them exactly where he is going.
- Probably going.

93
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:09,944
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is
a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

94
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:13,865
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car!
- He was doing very well last night!

95
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:16,243
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

96
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:23,751
Doctor Chance, plese come to point C ...

97
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:28,047
Doctor Chance, point C please.

98
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:31,340
... and the book ends.

99
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:35,970
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

100
00:15:35,971 --> 00:15:37,765
is fate.

101
00:15:38,474 --> 00:15:39,766
You see ...

102
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:44,062
fate caught up with several lives here.

103
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:49,066
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

104
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:52,737
he was destined to his own fate,

105
00:15:52,738 --> 00:15:56,742
his own day of reckoning with himself.

106
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:59,160
The idea ...

107
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,162
is ...

108
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,163
that destiny ...

109
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:08,045
is a very real, concrete thing
that every person has to deal with.

110
00:16:08,336 --> 00:16:14,049
How does Samuels' view of fate
differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

111
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,634
M'am?

112
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:16,470
Answer the question.

113
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:21,641
Costaine wrote that fate...
was somehow related only to religion

114
00:16:21,766 --> 00:16:27,438
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like
a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

115
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:31,150
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

116
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,154
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

117
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:38,657
It stands, where man passes a way.

118
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:40,869
Fate never changes.

119
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:05,767
You, with pumpkin.
- Leave me alone!

120
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:12,149
He's gonna get you!
- He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

121
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,943
The boogeyman is coming!
- Leave me alone!

122
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:18,238
He doesn't believe us.
- Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

123
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,575
Yeah, we get candy.

124
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:28,374
The boogey man!
- The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey ...

125
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,174
He's on his way.

126
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,555
You gotta believe me officer,
he is coming to Haddonfield.

127
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:10,058
Because I know him.

128
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,645
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

129
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:16,940
If you don't, it's your funeral.

130
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:11,368
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

131
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,745
Can't hear now, we yell a little louder.

132
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:16,039
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder!

133
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,542
Can't hear now ... continue
- Oh, look at you.

134
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:21,045
Get off the books you have.
You neeed a shopping cart to get home.

135
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:26,759
Heeey Haddonfield!
- Yeah, one for me.

136
00:20:28,136 --> 00:20:31,555
You know it's totally insane!
We have three new cheers to learn in the morning,

137
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:34,641
the game in the afternoon, I have to get my hair
done at five and the dance is at eight.

138
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:37,060
I'll be totally wiped out!

139
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:39,564
I don't think get enough to do tommorow.
- Totally!

140
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:50,241
As usual, I have nothing to do.
- It's your own fault and I don't feel bit sorry for you.

141
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,869
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

142
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,870
Why didn't you wait for me?

143
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:56,664
We did.

144
00:20:56,665 --> 00:21:01,043
Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed.
- That's not true. Here I am.

145
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:07,632
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

146
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:13,054
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell ...
- Exploring uncharted territory?- It's been totally charted.

147
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:14,265
We just talked.

148
00:21:14,266 --> 00:21:15,431
Sure, sure.

149
00:21:15,432 --> 00:21:20,270
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
and soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

150
00:21:20,271 --> 00:21:22,063
He can't come over tonight.

151
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:26,068
I thought you were babysitting tonight. - The only reason
she babysits is to have a place to... - Oh shit ...

152
00:21:27,236 --> 00:21:29,238
I have a place for that.

153
00:21:30,072 --> 00:21:31,740
I forgot my chemistry book.

154
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:36,744
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book
and my math book and my english book and my ...

155
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:38,539
and let's see my French book and ...

156
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,042
Who needs books anyway? I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

157
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:45,337
it doesn't really matter if I you got that books or not.

158
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:48,757
Hey, isn't that the van Graham?

159
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,969
I don't think so.

160
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:54,263
I think he's cute.

161
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,060
Hey, jerk ...

162
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,771
Speed kills!

163
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,866
Gosh ... Can't he take a joke?

164
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:25,335
You know, Annie, some day
you gonna get us all into deep trouble.

165
00:22:28,338 --> 00:22:29,755
Totally.

166
00:22:29,756 --> 00:22:33,260
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

167
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:37,930
Well, are we still on for tonight?

168
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:40,933
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

169
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:42,643
Oh come on, Annie ...

170
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:45,062
Bob and I've been planning on it all week.

171
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,564
All right.

172
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,941
The Wallaces leave at seven.

173
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:50,235
I'm babysitting the Doyles.

174
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:55,239
It's only three houses down. We can keep each other
company. - Ohh, terrific ... I've got three choices.

175
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,536
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around or talk to you.

176
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,332
We're so ma ...

177
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:06,668
Here.

178
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:38,365
What time at night?

179
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:42,661
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little
brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

180
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:43,870
Fun-ny.

181
00:23:43,871 --> 00:23:46,040
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:23:59,262 --> 00:24:00,554
Annie, look.

183
00:24:01,055 --> 00:24:02,263
Look where?

184
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:03,641
Behind the bush.

185
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:09,063
I don't see anything.
- That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

186
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,649
Subtle, isn't he?

187
00:24:18,739 --> 00:24:20,533
Hey, creep!

188
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:26,831
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

189
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:30,167
He wants to take you out tonight.

190
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:46,265
He was standing right there.

191
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,934
Poor Laurie.

192
00:24:47,935 --> 00:24:50,270
Scared another one away.

193
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,439
It's tragic. You never go out.

194
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,528
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting
so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

195
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:02,533
I don't. I think you're whacko.
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

196
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,538
Well, home sweet home.

197
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,665
See you later.

198
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:12,042
Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:31,060
Excuse me, Laurie. - Oh, Mr. Brackett,
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - Oh, I didn't mean to scary ya.

200
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:32,229
I'm sorry.

201
00:25:32,729 --> 00:25:36,441
You know, it's Halloween.
I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

202
00:25:36,858 --> 00:25:37,858
Yes, sir.

203
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:39,361
Nice evening, sir.

204
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:20,568
Trick -o - treat, Trick -o - treat.

205
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:25,864
Oh, kiddo ...

206
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,159
thought you grew up from superstition.

207
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:17,750
Hello?

208
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:22,546
Hello?

209
00:27:25,466 --> 00:27:26,967
Who is this?

210
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:37,936
Hello?

211
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:39,437
Why did you hang up on me?

212
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:40,231
Annie?

213
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:41,564
Was that you?

214
00:27:41,565 --> 00:27:44,651
Of course.
- Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

215
00:27:44,652 --> 00:27:46,653
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

216
00:27:46,654 --> 00:27:48,530
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

217
00:27:48,531 --> 00:27:53,368
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
- I've already lost it.

218
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:54,244
I Doubt that.

219
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:57,663
Listen, my mother is letting me use her car.
I'll pick you up. 6:30.

220
00:27:57,664 --> 00:28:00,042
Ok, bye.
-Bye.

221
00:28:12,262 --> 00:28:14,139
Just calm down.

222
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,142
This is ridiculous.

223
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:34,469
Hurry up.

224
00:29:44,228 --> 00:29:45,646
Just have time.

225
00:29:59,035 --> 00:30:01,329
Judith Myers. Myers.

226
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,749
Row 18 ... plot 20.

227
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,545
Hey, you know. You know,
every town has something like this happen.

228
00:30:10,546 --> 00:30:12,130
I remember over in Russellville.

229
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:15,551
Old Charly Bowles. About fifteen years ago.

230
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:18,429
One night he, he finished dinner ...

231
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:21,557
And he excused himself from the table ...

232
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:24,435
And he went out to the garage ...

233
00:30:24,935 --> 00:30:27,229
He got himself a hack saw ...

234
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:30,231
And then he went back into the house ...

235
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:33,152
And he kissed his wife and two children goodbye ...

236
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,030
And then he proceeded ...
- Where are we?

237
00:30:37,531 --> 00:30:39,241
It's right over here.

238
00:30:40,034 --> 00:30:43,036
Myers, Judith Myers. I remember her.

239
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:44,330
Couldn't believe.

240
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:46,040
Such a young boy.

241
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:48,542
Well, you lost?

242
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:51,252
Why do they do it?

243
00:30:51,253 --> 00:30:53,047
Goddamn kids.

244
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:56,967
They'll do anything for Halloweens.

245
00:30:57,926 --> 00:31:01,055
It was grave, hers.
- Oh, I know that.

246
00:31:01,764 --> 00:31:03,432
18, 19 ...

247
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:07,728
Judith Myers.

248
00:31:10,856 --> 00:31:12,649
He came home.

249
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,030
You still spooked?

250
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,657
I wasn't spooked.

251
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,534
Lies.
- I wasn't.

252
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:27,246
Saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
- Probably Mr. Riddle.

253
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:31,959
He was watching me.
- Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

254
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,253
He can still watch.

255
00:31:33,254 --> 00:31:35,130
That's probably all he can do.

256
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:41,635
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured
carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

257
00:31:41,636 --> 00:31:44,555
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
...

258
00:31:44,556 --> 00:31:48,225
Thanks. - And for that matter,
I might as well be a girl scout myself tonight.

259
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:51,729
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Doctor Demensia.

260
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,651
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.

261
00:32:06,328 --> 00:32:07,536
My dad!

262
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:08,830
Get rid of this.

263
00:32:17,547 --> 00:32:20,550
Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

264
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:25,138
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

265
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:31,227
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

266
00:32:31,936 --> 00:32:33,145
Hi, Dad.

267
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:36,648
What happened?
- What? What happened?

268
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:39,860
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

269
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:42,029
You blame everything on kids.

270
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:47,659
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope
and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

271
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,038
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

272
00:32:51,247 --> 00:32:53,041
Aren't you gonna be late ...
- Huh?

273
00:32:53,042 --> 00:32:57,044
I said aren't you gonna be late.
- He shouts too.

274
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:02,049
Bye girls.

275
00:33:02,258 --> 00:33:03,926
Bye dad.
- Bye.

276
00:33:12,226 --> 00:33:13,227
Sheriff.

277
00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:17,355
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

278
00:33:17,356 --> 00:33:20,025
Lee Brackett.
- I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

279
00:33:20,026 --> 00:33:23,237
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that
- It's just important.

280
00:33:23,529 --> 00:33:25,740
Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

281
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,631
What's the matter with you?

282
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:45,633
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

283
00:33:45,634 --> 00:33:47,927
No, he didn't.
- He did.

284
00:33:47,928 --> 00:33:49,555
See the look on his face?

285
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,433
He always looks like that.

286
00:33:55,227 --> 00:33:57,146
What you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

287
00:33:57,147 --> 00:33:59,732
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

288
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,240
You know you could ask somebody.
- No, I couldn't.

289
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:12,827
Sure you could.
All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

290
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,746
You wanna go to the dance?

291
00:34:15,038 --> 00:34:17,040
You could do that, I couldn't.

292
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:21,253
Or you could ask Dick Paxter.
He could go out with ya.

293
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:23,755
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

294
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:27,134
Ben Tramor?

295
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:29,553
I knew it!

296
00:34:30,554 --> 00:34:34,057
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

297
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,059
Shut up.
- He is cute.

298
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,062
Ben Tramor.

299
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:12,929
Ok.

300
00:35:13,138 --> 00:35:14,556
Bye.

301
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:57,265
Trick or treat, trick or treat:
Give me something good to eat.

302
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:12,238
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in.
- How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

303
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:16,324
What time are you in your bed?
- I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

304
00:36:16,325 --> 00:36:17,660
Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

305
00:36:17,661 --> 00:36:19,537
Bye bye.
- Here.

306
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:49,232
Anybody lives here?
- No, not since 1963 when that happened.

307
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:53,237
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
- They may be right.

308
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,048
Look.
- What?

309
00:37:13,257 --> 00:37:14,758
What is that?

310
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,926
It's a dog.

311
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:24,434
Still warm.

312
00:37:25,644 --> 00:37:27,145
He got hungry.

313
00:37:29,857 --> 00:37:31,232
Could have been a skunk.

314
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:32,359
Could have.

315
00:37:33,735 --> 00:37:35,237
A man wouldn't do that ...

316
00:37:36,154 --> 00:37:37,656
This is not a man.

317
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,527
It happened in here.

318
00:38:16,152 --> 00:38:18,530
She was sitting right here ...

319
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,248
He could have seen her thru this window.

320
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,042
Standing on the lawn ...

321
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,545
He could have seen in side.

322
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,555
You must think of me ...

323
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,140
the very sinister doctor.

324
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,561
I do have a permit.

325
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:55,148
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

326
00:38:55,149 --> 00:38:56,024
Yes.

327
00:38:56,025 --> 00:38:57,527
Yeah, I'm a...

328
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:03,323
I met him ... fifteen years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

329
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:10,957
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

330
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,460
good or evil, right or wrong.

331
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,462
I met this ...

332
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:19,756
six year-old child with his ...

333
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,761
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

334
00:39:25,054 --> 00:39:26,931
the blackest eyes ...

335
00:39:27,556 --> 00:39:29,433
the Devil's eyes.

336
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,852
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

337
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:36,356
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up,
because I realized that

338
00:39:36,357 --> 00:39:40,236
what was living behind that boy's eyes
was purely and simply...

339
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:42,029
... evil.

340
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,531
What do we do?

341
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:46,659
He's been here once tonight ...

342
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:48,536
I think he'll come back.

343
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:50,662
I'm gonna wait for him.

344
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:53,748
I still think I should notify the radio and television.
- No.

345
00:39:53,749 --> 00:39:59,420
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they look
for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

346
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,549
mouth shut and their eyes open.

347
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:06,053
I'll check back in an hour.

348
00:40:17,356 --> 00:40:18,856
... oh now, cried Arthur.

349
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:21,651
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

350
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:23,236
'That's so, ' said the knight

351
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:25,530
in a bold and haughty manner.

352
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:29,325
I don't like that story.
- I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

353
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,828
Not anymore.

354
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:34,747
Why do you keep them under there?

355
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:36,750
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

356
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:39,044
'Laser Man' ...

357
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:42,547
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

358
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:44,549
'Tarantula Man' ...

359
00:40:44,925 --> 00:40:45,925
Laurie ...

360
00:40:45,926 --> 00:40:47,636
what's the Boogeyman?

361
00:40:54,142 --> 00:40:55,560
Doyle residence.

362
00:40:56,144 --> 00:40:58,229
It's me ...
- Hi Annie, what are you doing?

363
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,023
Making popcorn ...

364
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:01,857
Having fun ...

365
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:04,652
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

366
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:08,156
I have big, big news for you ...

367
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:12,327
Hold on a minute.

368
00:41:13,954 --> 00:41:15,121
Hi Lester...

369
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:18,625
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

370
00:41:24,255 --> 00:41:28,551
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

371
00:41:38,728 --> 00:41:42,649
I hate that dog ...
I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

372
00:41:43,149 --> 00:41:45,360
So, what is this big, big news?

373
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:50,532
What would you say if I told you that you were going
to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

374
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:53,159
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

375
00:41:53,826 --> 00:41:55,453
Well ...

376
00:41:55,954 --> 00:42:02,459
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited
when I told him how attracted you were to him.

377
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:03,628
Oh, Annie ...

378
00:42:04,253 --> 00:42:06,547
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

379
00:42:06,923 --> 00:42:08,632
How could you do that?

380
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:12,929
I mean how you just call him.
What do you mean it's easy?

381
00:42:13,638 --> 00:42:15,431
I can't believe this.

382
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:17,350
I can't tell you anything.

383
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:25,858
Please tell me you didn't.

384
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,735
Oh, you didn't.

385
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:32,156
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him.
- Boogeyman is outside.

386
00:42:32,657 --> 00:42:35,033
Laurie ... out there.
- Hold on.

387
00:42:35,034 --> 00:42:37,119
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

388
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,752
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

389
00:42:45,628 --> 00:42:47,046
Go watch TV.

390
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:48,756
It's just Tommy.

391
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:51,759
Oh, please, Annie ...

392
00:42:52,426 --> 00:42:53,928
You could do that.

393
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:59,558
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

394
00:43:00,726 --> 00:43:03,729
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

395
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,231
Shit!

396
00:43:06,023 --> 00:43:09,359
No, no, I just made a mess on myself.
I gotta call you back.

397
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,652
Oh, yuck!

398
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:12,153
Lindsey ...

399
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:14,239
I need a robe.

400
00:43:57,657 --> 00:43:58,741
Lindsey ...

401
00:43:58,742 --> 00:44:02,621
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

402
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:07,959
Never mind ...

403
00:44:08,251 --> 00:44:10,045
I guess he found a hot date.

404
00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:01,054
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
- After the movie.

405
00:45:01,721 --> 00:45:05,058
What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the Jack-O-Lantern.

406
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:07,018
What about the boogeyman?

407
00:45:07,352 --> 00:45:08,852
There is no such thing.

408
00:45:08,853 --> 00:45:11,146
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

409
00:45:11,147 --> 00:45:13,024
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

410
00:45:13,025 --> 00:45:13,858
No.

411
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:18,737
Tommy, Halloween night ...
it's when people play tricks on each other.

412
00:45:18,738 --> 00:45:21,740
It's all make believe.
I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

413
00:45:21,741 --> 00:45:25,744
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

414
00:45:25,745 --> 00:45:27,537
There was nobody outside.

415
00:45:27,538 --> 00:45:29,624
There was.
- What did he look like?

416
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,251
The boogyeman!

417
00:45:33,419 --> 00:45:35,046
We're not getting anywhere.

418
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:36,629
All right.

419
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:38,925
The boogyeman can only come out
on Halloween night, right?

420
00:45:38,926 --> 00:45:39,925
Right.

421
00:45:39,926 --> 00:45:43,220
Welll, I'm here tonight.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

422
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,347
Promise?

423
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:46,848
Promise.

424
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:49,143
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

425
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,520
Let's go.

426
00:46:14,126 --> 00:46:15,753
Hmm, terrific.

427
00:46:33,228 --> 00:46:34,146
Hello?

428
00:46:36,148 --> 00:46:37,524
Who's there?

429
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:42,654
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

430
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:47,534
Guess not.

431
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:51,246
No tricks for Annie tonight.

432
00:47:09,056 --> 00:47:10,640
Lindsey!

433
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:13,517
Lindsey, come out here!

434
00:47:13,518 --> 00:47:17,521
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

435
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:18,229
Spread out everybody.

436
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:20,650
We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

437
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:23,319
Holly cat.

438
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,155
Hey.
- Yeah.

439
00:47:25,822 --> 00:47:29,451
Almost perfect.
What's wrong?

440
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:32,954
We finally got one.
- We found a plain sourcer.

441
00:47:33,455 --> 00:47:36,124
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

442
00:47:36,958 --> 00:47:38,752
Lindsey!

443
00:47:39,544 --> 00:47:42,130
Lindseeey!

444
00:48:00,023 --> 00:48:02,816
No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

445
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:04,651
I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Hallo?

446
00:48:04,652 --> 00:48:07,529
Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

447
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:08,822
Yes, she is.

448
00:48:08,823 --> 00:48:10,240
Get her for me, will ya?

449
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:12,242
She's washing her clothes.

450
00:48:12,243 --> 00:48:14,537
Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

451
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:16,122
Ok.

452
00:48:21,127 --> 00:48:23,421
Annie, Paul called!

453
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:39,020
You locked yourself there.
- I know.

454
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:43,649
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

455
00:49:02,251 --> 00:49:05,546
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

456
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:26,734
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

457
00:49:29,737 --> 00:49:31,738
Hello?
Hi Annie.

458
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,948
Oh, hi Paul.
Stuck, huh?

459
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:38,536
All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.
Sure ... stuck in the widow.

460
00:49:38,537 --> 00:49:42,123
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

461
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:43,541
My parents are gone.

462
00:49:43,542 --> 00:49:46,627
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

463
00:49:46,628 --> 00:49:50,048
About half ago
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

464
00:49:51,049 --> 00:49:53,217
So why don't you just walk over?

465
00:49:53,218 --> 00:49:56,846
You coming pick me up.
- Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

466
00:49:56,847 --> 00:50:02,643
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

467
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:06,355
I think that's all you ever think about.
- That's not true, I think about lots of things.

468
00:50:06,356 --> 00:50:10,318
Now why don't we not stand here
talking about them and get down to doing them?

469
00:50:11,528 --> 00:50:18,451
Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

470
00:50:18,452 --> 00:50:22,247
Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ...
- I'm scared.

471
00:50:22,622 --> 00:50:24,749
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

472
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:27,918
I don't know.
- Well, come on get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.

473
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:30,254
I don't want to.

474
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:35,634
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
- I want to stay here and watch this.

475
00:50:35,635 --> 00:50:40,347
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

476
00:50:40,348 --> 00:50:43,226
Yes.
- Well, come with me.

477
00:50:48,648 --> 00:50:50,233
Come on! Hurry up.

478
00:51:16,134 --> 00:51:19,345
That strange that has to short it out.

479
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:21,138
Hi Tommy.

480
00:51:21,139 --> 00:51:21,848
Hi.

481
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:26,144
Come on in. We're making a Jack-O-Lantern.
- You know I wanna watch TV.

482
00:51:27,729 --> 00:51:29,355
Annie, come in here.

483
00:51:29,731 --> 00:51:33,650
...now the horrifying conclusion ...

484
00:51:33,651 --> 00:51:35,820
... to ... the them.

485
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,531
Oh, fancy.

486
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:41,951
This has not been my night.

487
00:51:43,536 --> 00:51:50,250
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash. I got stuck in a window.
- I'd like you call Ben Tramer and tell him you're just fooling around.

488
00:51:50,251 --> 00:51:55,213
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with
Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

489
00:51:55,214 --> 00:51:58,049
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

490
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,344
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

491
00:52:01,345 --> 00:52:02,345
Wait a minute.

492
00:52:02,346 --> 00:52:07,351
If you watch her,
I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

493
00:52:07,727 --> 00:52:08,727
Deal.

494
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:13,731
I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

495
00:52:13,732 --> 00:52:17,652
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, ok?
- Yeah.

496
00:52:17,653 --> 00:52:19,238
Bye.

497
00:52:23,033 --> 00:52:25,619
The old girl scout comes through again.

498
00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:42,553
# My Paul ... I give you all #

499
00:52:44,847 --> 00:52:51,228
# No keys, but pleeease ... #
#my Paul #

500
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:26,554
# Oh, Paul ... #
#I can no longer stall... #

501
00:53:26,555 --> 00:53:34,645
# Oh Paul. Oh Paul ...#
#I can no longer stall... #

502
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:37,816
# Dearly Paul ... #

503
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:41,027
# my Paul #

504
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:37,750
Attention ...

505
00:54:37,751 --> 00:54:40,252
Captain and crew standby reverse polarity.

506
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:44,048
Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing.

507
00:54:44,215 --> 00:54:47,217
And until further notice all land in and hold on.

508
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:48,344
That is all.

509
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:49,845
Artificial gravity are ...

510
00:54:49,846 --> 00:54:51,721
ad lock cut primary coarse.

511
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:53,224
Primary stature.

512
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,624
Lindsey ...

513
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:21,252
Lindseyyy ...

514
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:23,254
Where are you?

515
00:55:48,612 --> 00:55:55,034
There is the boogeyman! He is outside!
Look, there is the boogeyman outside! - What's wrong?

516
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:58,913
I saw the boogeyman! I know that - Oh, Tommy stop it!
- But at Lindsey's! - You're scaring Lindsey.

517
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:02,626
He's over there!
- Tommy, stop it! There is nobody out there!

518
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:07,631
There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this
I'll have to turn off the TV and send you to bed.

519
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:16,139
Nobody believes me.
- I believe you, Tommy.

520
00:56:48,129 --> 00:56:49,130
I'm not afraid.

521
00:56:49,131 --> 00:56:50,422
Bull.

522
00:56:50,423 --> 00:56:52,217
I'm not.
- Then go in.

523
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,141
Chicken.

524
00:57:01,142 --> 00:57:02,644
Go ahead, Lonnie.

525
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:05,146
Go in!

526
00:57:08,316 --> 00:57:09,150
Hey!

527
00:57:09,818 --> 00:57:11,318
Hey, Lonnie ...

528
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:13,947
Get your ass away from there ...

529
00:57:26,251 --> 00:57:27,542
Jesus.

530
00:57:27,543 --> 00:57:29,045
Are you all right here?

531
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,545
Yeah.

532
00:57:30,546 --> 00:57:36,218
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks,
trick or treating, partying, getting high.

533
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,512
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

534
00:57:38,513 --> 00:57:41,723
You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

535
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:43,517
What more do you need?

536
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:47,521
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk
to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

537
00:57:47,522 --> 00:57:50,023
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

538
00:57:50,024 --> 00:57:54,027
sitting in a room, staring at a
wall, not seeing the wall ...

539
00:57:54,028 --> 00:57:55,529
looking past the wall

540
00:57:55,530 --> 00:57:58,950
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

541
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,912
Waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

542
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,539
to trigger him off.

543
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:09,918
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

544
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,130
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

545
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,216
More fancy talk.

546
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:17,551
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

547
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:18,635
Families ...

548
00:58:18,636 --> 00:58:21,846
Children ... all lined up in rows,
up and down these streets.

549
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:24,225
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

550
00:58:24,226 --> 00:58:25,851
They could be.

551
00:58:27,144 --> 00:58:29,229
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

552
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:30,523
just on the chance that you're right.

553
00:58:31,649 --> 00:58:33,150
And if you are right ...

554
00:58:33,651 --> 00:58:36,028
damn you for letting him go.

555
00:58:57,716 --> 00:59:00,718
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right?
Then we just talk a little.

556
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,723
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll
go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

557
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:08,017
First I rip your clothes off ...

558
00:59:08,018 --> 00:59:11,729
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot.
- Then you rip my clothes off...

559
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,649
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

560
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,651
Totally.

561
00:59:35,545 --> 00:59:38,214
Bob ... put me down.

562
00:59:38,215 --> 00:59:41,133
Put me down. This is totally silly.

563
00:59:41,134 --> 00:59:42,344
Put me down.

564
00:59:45,514 --> 00:59:47,724
Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

565
00:59:48,642 --> 00:59:49,851
Annie!

566
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:53,146
Annie, we're here!
- I wonder where they went.

567
00:59:54,022 --> 00:59:56,733
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

568
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:06,618
Hey, let's look for a note.

569
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,119
Let's not.

570
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:44,237
He's gonna get you ...

571
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:48,242
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

572
01:01:04,342 --> 01:01:06,844
Everybody's having good time tonight.

573
01:01:07,511 --> 01:01:09,346
All right, guys, what's next?

574
01:01:09,347 --> 01:01:13,351
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

575
01:01:13,517 --> 01:01:14,518
Yeah.

576
01:01:18,314 --> 01:01:19,732
All right, put it back on.

577
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:33,411
Doyle house.

578
01:01:33,412 --> 01:01:35,538
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

579
01:01:35,539 --> 01:01:37,750
I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

580
01:01:38,626 --> 01:01:40,211
Hey ... is Annie around?

581
01:01:40,628 --> 01:01:41,921
No, I thought she'd be home by now.

582
01:01:41,922 --> 01:01:45,341
She went to pick up Paul.
- Well, she's totally not here.

583
01:01:47,134 --> 01:01:49,011
She's probably stopped off some place.

584
01:01:49,012 --> 01:01:53,015
Have her call me when she gets home. I've got Lyndsey
here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.

585
01:01:53,223 --> 01:01:56,642
Okay. Later.
- Have a good time.

586
01:01:56,643 --> 01:01:58,729
We definetely will.

587
01:01:59,646 --> 01:02:00,814
Bye.

588
01:02:02,733 --> 01:02:07,738
Lindsey is gone for the night.
- Hey, now that's wonderful.

589
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:53,032
Oh, shit! Not again.

590
01:02:53,033 --> 01:02:55,035
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

591
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:58,538
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh?
- Just answer that damn phone.

592
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,540
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

593
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,209
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

594
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:09,215
Just take it off the hook.

595
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,918
Fantastic.

596
01:03:48,337 --> 01:03:51,132
Totally.
- Yeah.

597
01:04:02,518 --> 01:04:04,227
Is that all you can say?

598
01:04:04,228 --> 01:04:05,021
Yeah.

599
01:04:08,024 --> 01:04:11,026
Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

600
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:12,111
Yeaah.

601
01:04:14,614 --> 01:04:16,239
I'll be right back.

602
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,409
Don't get dressed.

603
01:05:14,214 --> 01:05:15,215
Annie?

604
01:05:16,508 --> 01:05:17,509
Paul?

605
01:05:21,346 --> 01:05:23,640
Lynda, you asshole!

606
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:29,228
Ok, Lynda.

607
01:05:29,229 --> 01:05:30,314
Come on out.

608
01:06:33,543 --> 01:06:34,836
Well, did you get my beer?

609
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:44,220
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

610
01:06:56,607 --> 01:06:58,109
See anything you like?

611
01:07:06,117 --> 01:07:08,536
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

612
01:07:17,044 --> 01:07:19,046
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

613
01:07:25,344 --> 01:07:27,013
Ok, ain't answer me?

614
01:07:31,225 --> 01:07:32,727
Ok, don't answer me?

615
01:07:34,145 --> 01:07:37,439
Oh, you're weird!
- I'm gonna call Laurie.

616
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,024
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

617
01:07:40,025 --> 01:07:41,527
This is going nowhere.

618
01:07:45,739 --> 01:07:47,116
Finally.

619
01:07:53,122 --> 01:07:54,123
Hello.

620
01:07:57,418 --> 01:07:58,335
Hello?

621
01:08:01,213 --> 01:08:05,634
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing,
now I get your famous squealing?

622
01:08:09,847 --> 01:08:11,306
Annie, you all right?

623
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:23,235
Are you fooling around again?

624
01:08:24,736 --> 01:08:26,530
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

625
01:08:27,447 --> 01:08:28,407
Annie?

626
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:32,411
Annie?

627
01:09:21,710 --> 01:09:23,545
Sleep tight, kids.

628
01:12:34,526 --> 01:12:35,735
Paul?

629
01:12:36,736 --> 01:12:38,029
Lynda?

630
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:47,205
Lynda?

631
01:12:58,716 --> 01:12:59,842
Annie?

632
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:18,736
Annie?

633
01:13:22,114 --> 01:13:23,241
Lynda?

634
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:26,911
Bob?

635
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:44,011
All right, Annie ...

636
01:14:09,244 --> 01:14:11,413
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

637
01:14:16,043 --> 01:14:17,044
Come on, Annie.

638
01:14:17,045 --> 01:14:18,128
It's enough.

639
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:25,010
This is most definitely stopping funny.
Now cut it out!

640
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:29,723
You'll be sorry.

641
01:17:41,622 --> 01:17:42,623
No.

642
01:18:08,732 --> 01:18:10,025
Help!

643
01:18:10,442 --> 01:18:12,902
Somebody help me, please!

644
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:15,029
Somebody help!

645
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:17,115
Oh, God, help me!

646
01:18:17,741 --> 01:18:18,909
Please!

647
01:18:19,534 --> 01:18:20,911
Please, help me!

648
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:24,623
Heeeelp!

649
01:18:25,332 --> 01:18:27,334
Oh, God, help me, please!

650
01:18:27,626 --> 01:18:28,710
Hello!

651
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,337
Helloo!

652
01:18:30,629 --> 01:18:31,630
Hello?

653
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:34,340
Helloo, help me!

654
01:18:34,341 --> 01:18:36,216
Will you please help me?

655
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:37,510
Please!

656
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:39,804
Can't you hear me?!

657
01:18:40,305 --> 01:18:41,514
Oh, God ...

658
01:18:44,601 --> 01:18:46,936
Help me, please!

659
01:18:58,531 --> 01:18:59,907
The keys!

660
01:18:59,908 --> 01:19:01,910
Oh, the keys!

661
01:19:06,831 --> 01:19:08,124
Tommyy!

662
01:19:09,208 --> 01:19:11,127
Tommy, it's mee!

663
01:19:13,129 --> 01:19:14,505
Tommyy!

664
01:19:23,306 --> 01:19:26,434
Who is it?
- Tommy, open up, it's mee!

665
01:19:27,602 --> 01:19:29,604
Tommy please!

666
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:32,022
Tommy, hurry up!

667
01:19:32,023 --> 01:19:34,108
Tommy please!

668
01:19:37,528 --> 01:19:40,405
Hurry up! Tommy please!

669
01:19:40,406 --> 01:19:43,117
Tommy, go upstairs. - What is it, Laurie?
- Tommy go back upstairs, grab the Lindsey and lock the door.

670
01:19:43,118 --> 01:19:46,537
I'm scared!- Do what I say! Now!
- It's the boogeyman, isn't it? - Hurry!

671
01:19:58,716 --> 01:20:00,217
Oh, no ...

672
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:16,900
Please, stop.

673
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:18,402
Please ...

674
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:37,229
Where were you? I went to the Meyers house.
- I found the car. He is here!

675
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:41,526
Where? - He's three blocks down.
You go around back off the houses, I'll watch the front.

676
01:21:41,735 --> 01:21:42,610
Go on!

677
01:22:13,099 --> 01:22:15,018
Tommy ... Lyndsey ...

678
01:22:17,103 --> 01:22:18,604
Babies ...

679
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,234
We're gonna take a little walk.

680
01:22:24,235 --> 01:22:25,528
Was it the boogeyman?

681
01:22:26,237 --> 01:22:28,405
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

682
01:22:28,406 --> 01:22:29,907
Are you sure?

683
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,410
How?

684
01:22:32,702 --> 01:22:34,120
I killed him.

685
01:22:34,829 --> 01:22:36,831
You can't kill the boogeyman.

686
01:22:40,626 --> 01:22:43,212
Get in there! Come on, Tommy! Now, lock the door!

687
01:25:21,327 --> 01:25:22,703
Tommy ...

688
01:25:22,704 --> 01:25:24,038
Unlock the door.

689
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:28,626
Come here.

690
01:25:29,502 --> 01:25:30,503
Now just listen to me ...

691
01:25:31,629 --> 01:25:33,131
I want you to go down the stairs ...

692
01:25:33,132 --> 01:25:34,714
and out the front door.

693
01:25:34,715 --> 01:25:37,135
And I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house ...

694
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:39,719
I want you to tell them to call the police.

695
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,721
And tell them to send them over here.

696
01:25:41,722 --> 01:25:43,599
Laurie ...
- Now, do you understand me?

697
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,226
