00:02:49,304 --> 00:02:52,390
-Somebody will see!
-No way.

3
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:03,735
-Does Maryann kiss as good as I do?.
-How would I know?.

4
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,335
-You said we were special.
-I meant everything.

5
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:25,816
Somebody's there!

6
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:38,913
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing a...

7
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:52,635
Please, don't!

8
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:22,784
Hi, girl. Excuse me! Hi, boy.

9
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:26,705
You speak English?.
How far is it to Camp Crystal Lake?.

10
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:31,543
That far?.
Okey-dokey. See you later.

11
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:44,598
It's 7:01 on Friday the 13th of June.

12
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:49,478
This is Big Dave and it's time for you
Lazybones to get out of bed.

13
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:53,190
It's bLack-cat day in Crystal Lake.

14
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,700
I must have seen that Kojak 82 times.

15
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:08,997
Excuse me. How far
is Camp Crystal Lake from here?.

16
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,879
What is it, Enos?. About 20 miles?.

17
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,006
-About that.
-Camp Blood?.

18
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:22,135
-They' re opening that place again?.
-Lots of luck.

19
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:25,430
-Can I get a bus or something?.
-Not likely.

20
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,894
You going out to the crossroads, Enos?.
What about a lift?. That would be halfway.

21
00:08:31,061 --> 00:08:34,564
No sweat, Trudy. Okay, kid, let's move it.

22
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:39,319
-Name's Annie.
-All right, Annie, let's go.

23
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:51,122
All the girls up there
gonna look as good as you?.

24
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:57,962
-You're going to Camp Blood, ain't you?.
-Goddamn it, Ralph, get out of here!
Leave people alone!

25
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,758
-You'll never come back!
-Oh, shut up, Ralph!

26
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:06,054
It's got a death curse!

27
00:09:08,056 --> 00:09:11,017
He's a real prophet of doom, ain't he?.

28
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,062
Climb up, miss.

29
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:36,668
He's causing problems enough
for your boss with all that talk.

30
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,256
Goddamn nuisance.

31
00:10:04,862 --> 00:10:08,160
-He tell you anything?.
-Who?.

32
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:10,826
Your boss. Steve Christy.

33
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:14,664
I'll be cooking for 50 kids and 10 staff.

34
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:20,336
-Campers will mostly be inner-city children.
-No, I mean about what happened.

35
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,091
No.

36
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:33,015
Come on. There's something
you're not telling me.

37
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:40,565
-Quit. Quit now.
-Quit?. Why would I want to quit?.

38
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:45,361
- Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!
- Terrific.

39
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:50,116
-Not you too. You sound
like your crazy friend back there.
-Well, maybe.

40
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:54,453
Did Christy tell you about
the two kids murdered in '58?.

41
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,292
Boy drowning in '57?. A bunch of fires?.

42
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,627
Nobody knows who did any of them.

43
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:06,507
In 1962, they were going to open up.
The water was bad.

44
00:11:06,674 --> 00:11:09,885
Christy will end up like his folks:
crazy and broke.

45
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:14,974
He's been up there a year fixing up that
place. Must have dropped $25,000.

46
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:19,020
And for what?. Ask anybody.

47
00:11:19,687 --> 00:11:23,232
-Quit!
-I can't.

48
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:27,111
Dumb kids. Know-it-alls.

49
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,823
Just like my nieces. Heads full of rocks.

50
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:36,746
-You're an American original.
-I'm an American original.

51
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:42,168
-Dumb kid.
-At least I'm not afraid of ghosts.

52
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:06,817
-Take care of yourself.
-No sweat. Thanks for the lift.

53
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:43,316
Hey, Marcie. You really think
there'll be other gorgeous women...

54
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:47,316
..at Camp Crystal Lake besides yourself?.

55
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:51,820
-ls sex all you ever think about, Ned?.
-Hey, no. No. Absolutely not.

56
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,657
Sometimes I just think about
kissing women.

57
00:13:57,177 --> 00:14:00,722
-You wanna give me a hand over here?.
-Sure.

58
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,601
Alice! I wanna get this tree stump out.

59
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:08,271
Get on this side, you pull
on that side. Alice!

60
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:09,815
Coming.

61
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:16,571
-That's great. I'm Steve Christy.
-Jack.

62
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,281
-Marcie
-Ned Rubinstein.

63
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:21,159
Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.
This is Alice.

64
00:14:21,368 --> 00:14:26,456
- Hi. Steve, Cabin B is all ready.
- Where's Bill?. Cleaning out the boathouse?.

65
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:31,002
- Haven't seen him in half an hour.
- I wanted him to start painting. Brenda?.

66
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:35,799
-Setting up the archery range.
-I'd rather she paint. Come on. Let's go.

67
00:14:35,966 --> 00:14:38,009
I thought we had two weeks.

68
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:42,347
Come on. I'll show you
where you can get changed.

69
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,525
-Here, let me give you a hand with that.
-Thank you.

70
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:04,995
You got it?.

71
00:15:25,932 --> 00:15:29,477
You draw very well.

72
00:15:29,644 --> 00:15:34,774
Thanks. I wish I had more time to do it.
Oh, dummy.

73
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:40,780
-When did you do this?.
-Last night.

74
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:44,909
-Do I really look like that?.
-You did last night.

75
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:53,459
You're very talented.

76
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:57,505
You're very pretty.

77
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:05,013
This really isn't your cup of tea, is it?.
Any particular reason?.

78
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:09,350
It's just a problem I have.
It's nothing personal.

79
00:16:11,978 --> 00:16:13,272
You wanna leave?.

80
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,693
I don't know. I may have to go back to California
to straighten something out.

81
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:24,365
Come on. Give me another chance.

82
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,703
Stay a week.
Help get the place ready.

83
00:16:29,162 --> 00:16:34,292
By Friday, if you're not happy,
I'll put you on the bus myself.

84
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:39,547
All right. Friday. I'll give it a week.

85
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:48,222
Thanks, Alice.

86
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:05,907
Bill?. Steve wants to know
if we need more paint.

87
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:09,660
-Paint's all right. Need more thinner.
-Okay.

88
00:17:09,827 --> 00:17:14,832
-Alice. Did the others show up?.
-Yeah, eVerybody except that girl Annie.

89
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:20,004
-Think you're gonna last all summer?.
-I don't know if I'm gonna last all week.

90
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,798
-I'll tell Steve about the thinner.
-Fine.

91
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:40,775
-You want it listed separately?.
-Right.

92
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,819
Brenda, I want you to
finish the archery range.

93
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:48,282
If Annie gets here, get her started
in the kitchen. Do your best.

94
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,660
I'll be back sometime after lunch.

95
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:55,581
It's supposed to rain like hell,
so get as much done as possible.

96
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:06,133
He neglected to mention that downtown
they call this place "Camp Blood. "

97
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:11,013
Next there'll be snakes in the
outhouse and crocodiles in the lake.

98
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,683
No, the crocodiles are in the cabins.

99
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:48,425
- Are you crazy?.
- Wanna see my trick shot?. It's even better.

100
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:52,429
I don't believe you!

101
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:58,352
You know, you're beautiful
when you're angry, sweetheart.

102
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:02,690
You come to help me or scare
me to death?. You do that again...

103
00:19:02,856 --> 00:19:07,695
-...I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
-I love that sexy talk!

104
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:35,931
Hi. I'm going to Camp Crystal Lake.

105
00:19:50,362 --> 00:19:53,365
Guess I always wanted to
work with children.

106
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:57,244
I hate when people call them "kids. "
Sounds like little goats.

107
00:19:57,411 --> 00:20:01,832
But when you've had a dream
as long as I have, you'll do anything.

108
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:27,607
Hey, wasn't that the road for
Camp Crystal Lake back there?

109
00:20:32,738 --> 00:20:35,866
I think we better stop.

110
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,453
Please?.

111
00:20:41,663 --> 00:20:46,042
Stop, please! Please! Stop!

112
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,962
Please, stop!

113
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:15,632
No. No.

114
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,803
No.

115
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,068
All right, move it out. A little to the left.
Little to the left.

116
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:44,911
Move it out. Move it out. Okay,
little to the left. Now-- No, no.

117
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:05,223
If you were a flavor of ice cream,
what would it be?.

118
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,352
-Rocky Road.
-Hey!

119
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:25,410
What's that Vitamin C
stuff do for you, anyway?.

120
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:29,789
Vitamin C is supposed to neutralize
the nitrates or something.

121
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:33,793
What's the matter?.
Do you see something?.

122
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:39,632
No. Nothing.

123
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:47,098
Ned! Get out of here!

124
00:23:55,147 --> 00:23:59,026
Hey, you guys.
Ready to go back to work?.

125
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:06,242
-Come on, Alice.
-Help! Help!

126
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:11,664
-Something's wrong with Ned.
-Get a life preserver!

127
00:24:28,097 --> 00:24:30,516
-Can he swim?.
-I don't know.

128
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:33,519
-He's right around here somewhere.
-I got it.

129
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:36,522
Go ahead, dive for him.

130
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,069
-There he is!
-Come on. Help me.

131
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,787
-Watch his head!
-Got him?.

132
00:24:57,543 --> 00:25:01,046
Can you giVe mouth-to-mouth?.

133
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:09,388
-Oh, God.
-Come on, Ned.

134
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:12,141
-Oh, Neddy!
-Oh, Jesus Christ!

135
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:22,234
Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?.

136
00:25:54,892 --> 00:25:56,602
Bill!

137
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,939
Bill, come here, quick! Hurry!

138
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:08,864
-What is it?.
-There's a snake over there.

139
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,783
Where?.

140
00:26:17,706 --> 00:26:20,626
-What do I do?.
-Kill it.

141
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,500
- It might bite.
-Haven't you ever been in the woods?.

142
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:26,131
We're not in the woods.

143
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:28,136
-Bill, what are you doing?.
-There's a snake.

144
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:31,136
-Why are we in here?.
-Feet don't fail me now!

145
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:39,353
-I can't sleep with a snake in here.
-Nobody said anything about snakes.

146
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,232
-Kill it!
-I can't get it until it comes out.

147
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:46,528
-Well, call him!
-How do you call a snake?.

148
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:48,528
I'll flush him!

149
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:56,161
-I got it.
-Where?.

150
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:11,510
Is it dead?.

151
00:27:11,677 --> 00:27:15,889
Either that or it's got a very short clone.

152
00:27:16,056 --> 00:27:20,936
-Well, at least we know what's for dinner.
-Marcie!

153
00:27:25,524 --> 00:27:28,318
I'm making salad. Want me
to make some for everybody?.

154
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:32,030
-That would be great. There's hamburger
-None for me.

155
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,616
There are apples.
Know how to make apple pie?.

156
00:27:34,783 --> 00:27:38,620
-Sure. No sweat.
-What is going on?.

157
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,965
Oh, shit.

158
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:55,887
-Who are you people?.
-Camp counselors. Ned is fooling around.

159
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:57,931
-Right, just...
-Can it, Cochise.

160
00:27:58,098 --> 00:28:00,517
SteVe Christy hire you people?.
He pay you for this?.

161
00:28:00,684 --> 00:28:02,894
-Nice bike.
-You been smoking, boy?.

162
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,730
Smoking?. Don't smoke. Causes cancer.

163
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:11,152
You just get off a spaceship or something?.
Colombian gold. Grass. Hash. The weed.

164
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:13,655
-What's he talking about?.
-Don't get smart.

165
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:17,594
-Me?. I'm as dumb as they come.
-Not another word out of you, understand?.

166
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:23,164
-Nothing's going on here.
We're getting the place in shape.
-For what?.

167
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,960
-ls there anything we can do to help?.
-I'm looking for somebody.

168
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:31,047
-Who's that?.
-A guy named Ralph. The town crazy.

169
00:28:31,214 --> 00:28:34,342
There's no crazy people around here.

170
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:39,305
I told you to sit on it, Tonto. I got word
Ralph was pedaling out this way...

171
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:42,767
-...spouting his gospel.
-We haven't seen anybody here.

172
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:45,937
-Just us.
-This guy Ralph. Is he dangerous?.

173
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:49,274
Every time that loony gets drunk,
he gets his calling.

174
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:53,069
I spend the morning in court,
he gets a week in jail.

175
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:57,449
Cycle Two, where are you?
Come in, Cycle Two.

176
00:28:57,615 --> 00:29:01,119
This is Dorf. I' m out here
at Camp Crystal Lake. Over.

177
00:29:01,286 --> 00:29:04,622
Haul it back in, Dorf.
Chief wants you back in town.

178
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:09,294
Roger that. 10-5. On my way. Out.

179
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,380
Never keep the chief waiting.

180
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:20,305
You kids keep your noses clean.
You'll be hearing from me if you don't.

181
00:29:22,932 --> 00:29:25,810
We ain't gonna stand
for no weirdness out here.

182
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:16,694
I'm a messenger of God.
You're doomed if you stay here

183
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:22,366
This place is cursed. Cursed.

184
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:27,371
-It's got a death curse!
-Who are you?.

185
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:29,582
What do you want?.

186
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:34,128
-God sent me.
-Get out of here, man!

187
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:39,175
I got to warn you.
You're doomed if you stay.

188
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:43,763
Go. Go!

189
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:59,528
-I think we just met Ralph.
-God, what's next?.

190
00:31:09,663 --> 00:31:14,668
You're doomed. You're all doomed.

191
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,365
-Who likes them rare?.
-Me.

192
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,865
How can you guys eat that?.
It looks like dead animals.

193
00:31:45,032 --> 00:31:48,619
Dead animals?. That's the old counselors.
You cannibals!

194
00:31:48,786 --> 00:31:51,872
If you would mix this stuff right,
you'd get all the protein you need.

195
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,921
-Too bad Annie never showed. She was supposed
to be a good cook.
-Don't expect me to play chef.

196
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:01,966
-Trouble?.
-Yeah. A bad bulb or no power.

197
00:32:02,132 --> 00:32:04,301
Seems a little gloomy in here.

198
00:32:04,468 --> 00:32:06,971
SteVe taught me how to use
the emergency generator.

199
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:12,935
-Town power lines are lousy.
-Don't you love that macho talk?.
Emergency generator.

200
00:32:13,102 --> 00:32:15,062
-Want to give me a hand?.
-Yeah.

201
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:19,066
-Wait for me.
-Can you watch the burgers?.

202
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:28,367
-Think he's gonna be bent out of shape?.
-I don't know.

203
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:32,454
This looks almost like the one
at my uncle's cabin in Maine.

204
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:36,166
-Well, here goes.
-What an antique.

205
00:32:44,341 --> 00:32:47,302
Well, what hath God wrought?.

206
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:05,839
Hello?.

207
00:34:15,223 --> 00:34:17,392
Can I help you?.

208
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:27,110
Hello?. Hello?.

209
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:31,615
-Come on.
-Coming, I'm coming.

210
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:39,080
Wind's come up.
Shifted a good 180 degrees.

211
00:34:39,247 --> 00:34:42,208
Makes me want to hold onto you.

212
00:34:46,046 --> 00:34:49,799
-What about Ned?.
-I don't love Ned.

213
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:53,178
-He keeps acting like such a jerk.
-Neddy!

214
00:34:53,345 --> 00:34:58,224
-Don't call him.
-Thought you wanted to give him
one of your motherly lectures.

215
00:34:58,391 --> 00:35:02,979
Look, Neddy's gonna do whatever
Neddy wants to do, you know?.

216
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:07,776
It's gonna storm. Gonna tear down
that Valley like a son of a gun.

217
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:12,947
- I've been afraid of storms since I was little.
-No. Really?.

218
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:18,161
I've had this dream about five or six
times where I'm in a thunderstorm...

219
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:25,168
...and it's raining really hard.
It sounds like pebbles when it hits the ground.

220
00:35:25,335 --> 00:35:31,174
I hear it and I try to block it out
with my hands, only it doesn't work.

221
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:34,344
It just keeps getting
louder and louder.

222
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,350
And then the rain turns to blood...

223
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:45,855
...and the blood washes away
in little rivers...

224
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:50,360
...and then the sound stops.

225
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:57,867
-It's just a dream.
-I know. I call it my "shower dream. "

226
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:02,705
Hey, hey. This is no dream.
Come on, we're gonna get soaked.

227
00:38:02,992 --> 00:38:08,539
- Jack and Marcie are gonna get drenched!
- Not if they're where I think they are.

228
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,442
That's nice.

229
00:38:37,026 --> 00:38:39,987
I know what we can do.
We'll play Monopoly.

230
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:43,365
-I hate Monopoly!
-Not the way I play it, you don't.

231
00:38:43,532 --> 00:38:46,702
-Like what?.
-We're going to play strip Monopoly.

232
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:51,000
-I'll be the shoe.
-You have got to be kidding.

233
00:38:51,001 --> 00:38:53,000
What if Steve walks in?.

234
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:57,588
We'll give him a handicap.
He can keep his boots on. It's easy.

235
00:38:57,755 --> 00:39:03,302
Instead of rent, you pay clothes. Bill
can be banker. Unless he's chicken.

236
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:06,138
Heaven help you if you land
in my hotel!

237
00:39:06,305 --> 00:39:09,725
Why don't you see if Marcie
left any of that grass?

238
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:14,229
-What happened to my 500's?.
-They're there. Where's my shoe?.

239
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:29,012
I'm not going to pass "Go"
without a glow.

240
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,973
We rolled for you. You're going last.

241
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,477
Community Chest cannot
give you your clothes back

242
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:39,648
Double sixes! I get to roll again!

243
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,901
-We're being hustled.
-I think you're right.

244
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,783
You are so fine.

245
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,750
Where are you going?.

246
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:02,045
I gotta pee.
You're lying on my bladder.

247
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,136
Hurry back, okay?.
It's getting cold in here.

248
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:22,274
-You'll save my place for me?.
-Yeah.

249
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,543
Five.

250
00:41:42,627 --> 00:41:46,923
-Baltic Avenue. I'll buy it.
-No one ever lands on Baltic Avenue.

251
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,217
I think it's a pretty color.

252
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,929
Come on.

253
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:55,390
Eight.

254
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:02,021
-Baltic Avenue. You owe me one boot.
-Coming.

255
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:04,357
Alice draws first blood.

256
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:08,403
-Terrible way to talk about my feet.
-Thank you.

257
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,573
Who's next?.

258
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:15,118
You know I think I'm beginning
to like this game.

259
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:18,246
Wait until he lands
on my old Kentucky home.

260
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,166
-More beer?. More beer.
-Let's see. A railroad.

261
00:44:23,621 --> 00:44:28,042
Forty Yards to the Outhouse,
by Willie Makit.

262
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:31,921
Come on, kids,
you can do better than that.

263
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:37,093
Jack?

264
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:43,766
Jack?

265
00:44:56,862 --> 00:45:01,075
When I looked into that mirror,
I knew I'd always be ugly.

266
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,997
I said,
"Lizzie, you'll always be plain. "

267
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,045
Hello?.

268
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,875
Ned?

269
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,964
Hey, come on, you guys.

270
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:45,762
It must be my imagination.

271
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,823
-Hello.
-Shit.

272
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,786
-Worst run of bad luck since Richard Nixon.
-You can call it quits.

273
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:15,125
Fat chance! You're two steps
from Pacific Avenue and Skin City.

274
00:47:21,423 --> 00:47:24,885
What can I say?.
It's not much, but I call it home.

275
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:31,391
-I'll get it. I'll get it.
-Get the money.

276
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,644
-God!
-It's blowing like crazy out there

277
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:38,982
I think I left the windows
in my cabin open. Shoot!

278
00:47:41,443 --> 00:47:47,741
We'll have to finish this game some other
Just when it was getting interesting.

279
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:51,119
-See you guys in the morning.
-See you.

280
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:53,663
-Good night.
-Good night.

281
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:04,299
Look at this mess! Here.

282
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:08,845
-Were you going to go ahead with it?.
-I hadn't made up my mind.

283
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:12,057
We'll have to finish
the game another night.

284
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:34,996
-ls there anything else you want?.
-No, thanks, Sandy. I'm fine.

285
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:38,374
You can't go out in that rain.
You want to drown?.

286
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,836
I've got to.
I've got six new counselors at camp.

287
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:45,340
They are babes in the woods,
in every sense.

288
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:50,094
They'll be okay if they know enough
to come out of the rain.

289
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,766
-Well, what do I owe you?.
-Just a night on the town, Steve.

290
00:48:54,933 --> 00:48:59,854
-Come on now, you know what I mean.
-That's okay. Two and a quarter.

291
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:04,609
Thank you.

292
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,041
-Here's your change.
-No, you keep it.

293
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:21,459
Thank you.

294
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,420
-Drive careful.
-I will.

295
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,211
-Hi.
-Hi.

296
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:57,466
-Thought that'd go through anything.
-Not dragging a trailer.Can you give me a lift?

297
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:01,762
-I'll have a counselor bring me back.
-Why not?.

298
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,177
Help me!

299
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,162
Help me!

300
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:20,442
Hello.

301
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:29,909
-Hello.
-Over here. Please somebody help me.

302
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,452
Hello.

303
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,165
Hello.

304
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,303
Hello.

305
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:59,606
Come quickly, please.
Come quickly. Help.

306
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:16,664
Where are you?
Hello?

307
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,935
Hello?.

308
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,610
All right.

309
00:56:47,945 --> 00:56:50,740
Come on out! You're not funny anymore!

310
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,203
It's not funny at all.

311
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,060
Bill.

312
00:58:02,144 --> 00:58:06,524
-Hi. The generator is okay.
-I thought I heard a scream.

313
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,694
-How can you hear in that wind?.
-lt sounded like Brenda.

314
00:58:10,861 --> 00:58:15,866
- I'd better look.
- Somebody turned on the lights
at the archery range.

315
00:58:18,202 --> 00:58:20,955
I can't see anything.

316
00:58:21,121 --> 00:58:26,126
- They're off now.
- I'm gonna check it out.

317
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:30,756
-Bill. Can I come?.
-Come on.

318
00:58:34,051 --> 00:58:37,846
Brenda!Brenda!

319
00:58:43,143 --> 00:58:46,647
Where is she?.

320
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:50,275
She must be with Jack and Marcie.

321
00:58:52,444 --> 00:58:55,781
Alice?.
Come here.

322
00:59:15,342 --> 00:59:18,470
What is going on?.

323
00:59:22,015 --> 00:59:24,017
Come on!

324
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:33,777
Jack! Jack, open the door.

325
00:59:36,405 --> 00:59:39,783
-Where are they?.
-I don't know. Come on.

326
00:59:45,122 --> 00:59:46,707
Brenda?.

327
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:49,334
Marcie?.

328
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:55,465
Jack?. Neddy?.

329
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:05,642
- Bill, I think we should call someone.
- If this is a joke, I'll brain them!

330
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:10,564
I'm serious.
I really think we should call someone.

331
01:00:19,072 --> 01:00:23,118
- The sucker's locked.Where's the key?
- I don't know.

332
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:24,828
Wait a minute.

333
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,964
Watch out.

334
01:00:40,218 --> 01:00:42,304
Be careful.

335
01:00:43,763 --> 01:00:46,391
Let me get the light.

336
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:58,111
- What's wrong?.
- It's dead. Try the pay phone.

337
01:00:58,278 --> 01:01:02,949
- Do you have a dime or a quarter?.
- No. Check the desk.

338
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:15,712
Hello?
This damn thing's dead too!

339
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:36,149
- What's the matter with it?.
- It's wet.I don't know.

340
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:39,944
Why don't we just hike out of here?.
Get out. Right now!

341
01:01:40,111 --> 01:01:43,865
It's 10 miles to the nearest crossroads.
Steve will be back soon.

342
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:47,327
We can use his jeep if we need
to get help. Don't worry.

343
01:01:47,494 --> 01:01:51,164
-There's some stupid explanation for this.
-Like what?.

344
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:56,211
We'll be laughing about this tomorrow,
I promise.

345
01:01:58,713 --> 01:02:00,089
Let's get out of the rain.

346
01:02:05,178 --> 01:02:10,099
It's not bad enough to have Friday the
13th, we've gotta have a full moon too.

347
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:15,063
We keep statistics. We have more
accidents, more rapes, more robberies..

348
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:18,983
...more homicides, more of everything
when there's a full moon.

349
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:24,822
- It upsets people. Makes them nuts
- You're making science out of coincidence.

350
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:29,535
I hear Ralph was out your way today.

351
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:32,747
His wife was a nervous wreck
until we got him home.

352
01:02:32,914 --> 01:02:36,292
That's all I need,
Crazy Ralph running around.

353
01:02:36,459 --> 01:02:41,631
Well, the rain's stopping.
It was a pisser while it lasted.

354
01:02:41,798 --> 01:02:45,510
Sgt. Tierney, come in.
Sgt. Tierney, Car Niner.

355
01:02:46,636 --> 01:02:48,137
This is Tierney.

356
01:02:48,304 --> 01:02:53,059
Rescue squad with Jaws of Life.
Near mile-marker 17. Possible fatals

357
01:02:53,226 --> 01:02:55,645
Three, maybe more, trapped.
Head on.

358
01:02:55,812 --> 01:03:00,108
Roger. Acknowledge receipt.
Estimate arrival, 15 minutes.

359
01:03:09,909 --> 01:03:12,912
-I have to let you off here.
-Sure.

360
01:03:13,913 --> 01:03:17,083
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

361
01:03:56,205 --> 01:03:57,748
Who is that?.

362
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:05,214
What are you doing
out in this mess?.

363
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:31,175
- What do you think happened?.
- I don't know.

364
01:05:32,468 --> 01:05:37,431
The generator's probably out of gas
I'll go check it.

365
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,643
Do you want me to come with you?.

366
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,938
Why don't you stay here
and try and sleep.

367
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:48,525
I'll be right back.

368
01:07:18,198 --> 01:07:20,700
Full of gas.

369
01:08:04,577 --> 01:08:06,621
Generator....

370
01:14:13,862 --> 01:14:17,073
What am I gonna do?.

371
01:15:34,025 --> 01:15:36,194
Who are you?.

372
01:15:36,361 --> 01:15:39,697
I'm Mrs. Voorhees.
An old friend of the Christys.

373
01:15:42,617 --> 01:15:47,372
I can't help you
if you don't calm down.

374
01:15:47,538 --> 01:15:52,335
But she's dead and he's dead.
Oh, my God! Poor Bill! Oh, God!

375
01:15:52,502 --> 01:15:55,838
-All right. Come on, dear. Show me.
-No. No!

376
01:15:56,005 --> 01:16:01,135
It's all right. I'll take care of you.
I used to work for the Christys

377
01:16:01,302 --> 01:16:03,680
What's going on?.
Help me get out of here!

378
01:16:03,846 --> 01:16:07,475
It's this place and the storm.
That's why you're upset.

379
01:16:07,642 --> 01:16:10,561
No, no! They're all dead!
They're all dead!

380
01:16:10,728 --> 01:16:15,733
-All right. I'll go look.
-Don't leave me! They'll kill you too!

381
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:18,069
I'm not afraid.

382
01:16:35,628 --> 01:16:38,714
Oh, my Lord!

383
01:16:40,174 --> 01:16:44,220
So young.
So pretty.

384
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:48,849
What monster could have done this?.

385
01:16:49,016 --> 01:16:51,519
Bill is out there!

386
01:16:51,852 --> 01:16:54,855
Oh, God, this place!

387
01:16:55,273 --> 01:17:01,153
Steve should never have opened this place again!
There's been too much trouble here.

388
01:17:01,988 --> 01:17:07,118
Did you know a young boy drowned?
The year before those two others were killed.

389
01:17:07,285 --> 01:17:13,624
The counselors weren't paying attention!
They were making love while that young boy drowned!

390
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:17,253
His name was Jason.

391
01:17:18,879 --> 01:17:22,299
I was working the day it happened.
Preparing meals.

392
01:17:22,466 --> 01:17:25,011
Here. I was the cook.

393
01:17:25,177 --> 01:17:30,141
Jason should have been watched!
Every minute! He was...

394
01:17:33,144 --> 01:17:36,647
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

395
01:17:38,023 --> 01:17:40,609
We can go now, dear.

396
01:17:40,901 --> 01:17:44,155
I think we should wait for Mr. Christy.

397
01:17:44,321 --> 01:17:48,492
- That's not necessary.
- I don't understand.

398
01:17:49,535 --> 01:17:51,454
Help me!

399
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:54,415
Help, Mommy!

400
01:17:54,582 --> 01:17:57,626
Help! Help, Mommy!

401
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:02,131
I am, Jason. I am.

402
01:18:05,259 --> 01:18:10,973
You see, Jason was my son.
And today is his birthday.

403
01:18:11,140 --> 01:18:13,642
Where's Mr. Christy?.

404
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:19,273
I couldn't let them open this place again.
Could l?.

405
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,443
Not after what happened.

406
01:18:25,112 --> 01:18:28,907
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason.

407
01:18:30,117 --> 01:18:33,912
My only child...Jason.

408
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:43,881
You let him drown!
You never paid any attention!

409
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:51,263
Look what you did to him!
Look what you did to him!

410
01:19:52,991 --> 01:19:56,244
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

411
01:20:00,499 --> 01:20:04,336
Don't let her get away, Mommy.
Don't let her live!

412
01:20:04,503 --> 01:20:08,423
I won't, Jason. I won't!

413
01:20:57,639 --> 01:21:00,725
Where are the goddamn bullets?.

414
01:21:16,074 --> 01:21:21,955
Come, dear It will be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

415
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:28,753
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her!

416
01:21:30,797 --> 01:21:33,049
Kill her.

417
01:23:09,228 --> 01:23:12,356
Kill her, Mommy. Kill her.

418
01:23:12,523 --> 01:23:16,110
She can't hide.
No place to hide.

419
01:23:16,277 --> 01:23:19,155
Get her, Mommy. Get her!

420
01:23:19,322 --> 01:23:21,657
Kill her! Kill her.

421
01:31:02,658 --> 01:31:05,369
Ten milligrams, Valium.
It's all right.

422
01:31:05,536 --> 01:31:07,705
It's all over. Everything's over.

423
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:13,294
Roll over. Roll over, dear.

424
01:31:33,856 --> 01:31:37,026
Your folks are on the way up.

425
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:41,739
Is anyone else alive?.

426
01:31:42,781 --> 01:31:46,577
- Are they all dead?.
- Yes, ma'am.

427
01:31:47,494 --> 01:31:52,541
Two of my men pulled you out of the lake.
We thought you were dead too

428
01:31:53,625 --> 01:31:55,919
Do you remember very much?.

429
01:31:56,086 --> 01:31:57,463
The boy.

430
01:31:57,629 --> 01:31:59,923
Is he dead too?.

431
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:03,677
-Who?.
-The boy, Jason.

432
01:32:04,887 --> 01:32:06,597
Jason?

433
01:32:06,764 --> 01:32:11,185
In the lake. The one who attacked me.
The one who pulled me under the water

434
01:32:13,061 --> 01:32:16,565
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

435
01:32:18,317 --> 01:32:20,903
But he....

436
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:29,411
Then he's still there.

437
