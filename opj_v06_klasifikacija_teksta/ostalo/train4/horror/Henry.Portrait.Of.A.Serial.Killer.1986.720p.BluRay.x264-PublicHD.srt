1
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,931
How was everything?

2
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,304
Real good honey, thanks.

3
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,227
Let me have a pack of
Kools too, would you?

4
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,157
Real nice smile you got there.

5
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,160
Thank you.

6
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:17,831
Good bye.

7
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:18,995
Bye.

8
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,191
<i>Shut...</i>

9
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,293
<i>Shut up, shut up!</i>

10
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,177
<i>Die bitch!</i>

11
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,306
<i>Die!</i>

12
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,381
Well Kathye mom
said she could do it.

13
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,024
Hi, are you going to the city?

14
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:40,686
Sure.

15
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,360
Hop in.

16
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,730
Becky.

17
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,441
Hello Otis.

18
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,698
Well, how are you?

19
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:29,949
Good.

20
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:30,950
It's good to see you.

21
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,531
Good to see you, too.

22
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,708
You got all your things?

23
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,750
Yeah.

24
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,290
You look terrible.

25
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,553
Okay, come on let's go.

26
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,677
It's this way.

27
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:03,645
Before you got
married I told you

28
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,605
Leroy was no damn good.

29
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,484
That he was trash

30
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,656
and he'd always be trash

31
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,530
and you was going to catch
it and you did didn't you?

32
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,986
I don't really want to
talk about him right now.

33
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,242
Okay by me, we don't
have to talk about it now.

34
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,039
We don't have to
talk about it ever.

35
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,209
How long are you
going to be up here?

36
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,330
It's hard to say.

37
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,285
What about Lurleen?

38
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,541
How long can you
leave her with mama?

39
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,997
I don't know.

40
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,423
I'm going to get a job,

41
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,247
make some money.

42
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,296
Maybe bring her up here,

43
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,592
I don't know.

44
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,544
Where did you tell
Leroy you were going?

45
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,004
I don't want to talk about him.

46
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,840
Okay, we don't have
to talk about him!

47
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,094
You hungry?

48
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,053
Yeah.

49
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,605
Good, I'm hungry too.

50
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,476
You think Leroy's hungry?

51
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,647
Do you want some more coffee?

52
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,947
Yeah, thanks.

53
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,149
Here.

54
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,125
So what kind of work do you
planning on getting up here?

55
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,296
Anything like...

56
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,999
I haven't decided yet.

57
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,176
What else can you do
besides dance naked?

58
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,594
Don't start with me Otis.

59
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,671
I can do lots of things mister.

60
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,926
Oh yea, like what?

61
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,508
Like waitressing

62
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,717
or a beautician.

63
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,767
Yeah.

64
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,892
After seeing you I might
just try brain surgery.

65
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,809
You're a card.

66
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,144
Yeah, I'm the queen.

67
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,900
Yeah, the queen of clubs.

68
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,490
Don't make me
sorry I came here, Otis.

69
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,411
Howdy.

70
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,629
Hey, Henry.

71
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,254
I brought you a present.

72
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,586
Where did you get that?

73
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,090
Picked it up.

74
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,133
Pretty nice?

75
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,219
Sure is a beauty.

76
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,659
Henry this here
is my sister, Becky.

77
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,656
She's gonna be staying here

78
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,783
with us for a
while like I said.

79
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,660
Becky this here's Henry.

80
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,662
Hello Henry.

81
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:22,583
Hello Becky.

82
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,582
Good to meet you.

83
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,663
She don't look
nothing like you,

84
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,713
that's for sure.

85
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,167
Lucky for her.

86
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,797
Henry's on his way out west.

87
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,843
Oh, where?

88
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:33,761
California.

89
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,553
She can sleep on the couch.

90
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:38,758
No, no.

91
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,811
Listen Becky I want you
to take the spare room.

92
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,388
No, Henry, thank you but no...

93
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,018
I insist.

94
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,520
Ain't that right Otis?

95
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,693
Up to you.

96
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,894
Alright,

97
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,401
but if it gets to be
a bother, we'll change.

98
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,732
Fair enough.

99
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:54,815
Well, I got to get going.

100
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,318
I got some work to do today.

101
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,921
I just stopped by
to clean up a little.

102
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,820
Where you working?

103
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,248
I'm helping Andy spray
some houses off La Grange.

104
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,325
So that's working out for you?

105
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,626
Yeah.

106
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,955
Sounds like fun.

107
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,829
Coffee?

108
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,674
No thanks, I gotta go.

109
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:15,837
See ya.

110
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,967
Yeah.

111
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,114
That's it till next week.

112
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,040
I was hoping for
a little more work.

113
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,914
So was I.

114
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,464
You never know.

115
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,916
Sometimes I get a call.

116
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,125
You know,

117
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:58,509
these assholes want you to
be out there the next day.

118
00:13:58,588 --> 00:13:59,430
You never know.

119
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,757
Yeah.

120
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,719
Here, take this.

121
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,599
We'll call it a retainer.

122
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,511
Thanks.

123
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,809
You don't here from me

124
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,563
give me a call.

125
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,433
Hold on.

126
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,856
Don't forget your sprayer.

127
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,562
Hang onto it.

128
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,906
Okay.

129
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,071
Come on, kid, come on.

130
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,781
Throw it in there.

131
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,911
Good catch.

132
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,669
Put a spiral on it.

133
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,996
Nice catch.

134
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,549
Sorry about that.

135
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,818
It's good.

136
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,827
And please check
the left rear tire.

137
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,718
It's good, too.

138
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,673
Thank you.

139
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,100
Yeah.

140
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,564
And what can I do for you, sir.

141
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,942
You got any more of
what you had last week?

142
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:02,943
I might.

143
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,150
Well do you, or don't you?

144
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,450
Yeah.

145
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,778
Well?

146
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,329
Well, I don't have
it on me, stupid.

147
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,290
Give me the money.

148
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,070
I'll bring it around the field.

149
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,172
I don't want you
hanging around practice.

150
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,046
Give me my money back.

151
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,341
UP to you.

152
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,889
Be in the parking lot at 6:30.

153
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,966
Sure thing.

154
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,393
6:30 tomorrow.

155
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,469
Tomorrow?

156
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,226
Take it or leave it.

157
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,100
Great.

158
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,602
See ya.

159
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,609
Fuckin' pervert.

160
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,288
Oh, it's so gross.

161
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:58,745
I always did hate doing this.

162
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,795
I'll do it.

163
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,497
That's alright.

164
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,091
Where did you say you met him?

165
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,172
Who?

166
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,384
You know who, Henry.

167
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,140
What do you want to know for?

168
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,220
I don't know.

169
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,979
I'm just curious.

170
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,151
Van Dalia.

171
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,523
Van Dalia?

172
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,856
Sure, Van Dalia.

173
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,241
What was he in for?

174
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,069
You don't want to know.

175
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,120
What did he do, kill his mama?

176
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,198
Come on, what was he in for?

177
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,204
You don't want to know.

178
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,002
What did he do,
rob a bank or something?

179
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,455
You were right the first time.

180
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,504
You were right the first time.

181
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,052
He killed his mama.

182
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,346
Don't you ever
tell him I told you.

183
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,468
You're kidding me?

184
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,343
No, I ain't.

185
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,256
Yes you are.

186
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,759
Alright, I'm kidding you.

187
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,095
Just don't ever
tell him I told you.

188
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,101
He killed his mama?

189
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,306
With a baseball bat.

190
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,108
Her and one of her boyfriends.

191
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:04,401
I swear if you ever
tell him I told you

192
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,150
I'll beat your ass right off.

193
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,400
How do you know all this?

194
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,107
He told me, that's how I know.

195
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,237
How else would I know?

196
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,408
Were you cellmates
or something?

197
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,328
No, we were friends.

198
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,655
When did he get out?

199
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,161
A couple of years before me.

200
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,550
Hi.

201
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,422
I got some business
I got to take care of.

202
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,214
You going out?

203
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,628
Yeah, for a while,

204
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,710
I got to run an
errand for a fellow.

205
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,592
You want to come along Henry?

206
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,469
No, you go ahead.

207
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,095
Okay.

208
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,676
See you later.

209
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:32,111
Want to play cards?

210
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,047
What was your daddy like?

211
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,750
My daddy?

212
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,085
He used to drive a truck

213
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:56,014
before he got his legs cut off.

214
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,056
I remember one time,

215
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,181
he brought me and my
little brother home bicycles.

216
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,557
He had delivered some that day

217
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,389
and he had a couple left over.

218
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,726
But, mine was
way too big for me,

219
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,855
and my brother

220
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,938
he couldn't ride his anyway.

221
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,864
Daddy, he said
I'd grow into it,

222
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,067
but, I never did.

223
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,073
Why not?

224
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,369
I never got the chance,

225
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,322
they sold it.

226
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,248
They sold them both.

227
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,917
So you have a brother?

228
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:29,788
My brother,

229
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,757
he had a bone disorder.

230
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,257
He was a little deformed.

231
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,135
What happened to him?

232
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,057
He died.

233
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,355
I can't ever remember

234
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,273
really liking my daddy.

235
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,225
I wanted to,

236
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,403
I really did.

237
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,230
One time he bought me,

238
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,157
when I was about five,

239
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:59,406
he bought me an ice cream cone

240
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,113
and I dropped it.

241
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,197
And he slapped me

242
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,705
and made me
pick it up and eat it.

243
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,381
I never liked my daddy.

244
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,082
One time,

245
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,088
when my momma was at work,

246
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,340
and I was about 13,

247
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,341
he come into my room

248
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,141
and he told me to
take my shirt off

249
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,436
'cause he wanted to see
how I was developed.

250
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:26,512
And when I wouldn't

251
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,565
he got real mad and he hit me.

252
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,267
And he told me he had a right

253
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,317
because he was my daddy

254
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,020
and I was his daughter

255
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:35,696
and he fed me

256
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,444
and let me live in his house

257
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,244
and he could do
whatever he wanted.

258
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,743
And he did.

259
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,699
Then he started coming
into my room a lot,

260
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,376
after that.

261
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,452
And I didn't fight him

262
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,915
because when
I did he just hit me.

263
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:57,002
I was afraid I was
going to have a baby

264
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,963
and that my baby
would be deformed

265
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,298
but, I never got pregnant.

266
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,432
I tried to tell mama,

267
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:11,391
but she didn't
want to hear about it.

268
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,975
She pretended not to believe me

269
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,311
but I knew she did.

270
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,403
It sure is good to talk...

271
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,406
to talk to you Henry,

272
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,279
because I know

273
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,325
you're not judgmental

274
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,532
or anything like that.

275
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,537
I never would have married
Leroy in the first place

276
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,749
if I hadn't wanted to get
away from daddy so bad.

277
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,425
Didn't get along
with your daddy?

278
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,934
Did you really kill your mama?

279
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,227
What?

280
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:53,691
Did you really kill your mama?

281
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:57,145
I guess I did.

282
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:01,107
How did it happen?

283
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,942
I stabbed her.

284
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,325
Otis said you hit her
with a baseball bat.

285
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,406
Otis said that?

286
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,662
Yeah.

287
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,962
Well, he's mistaken.

288
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,914
Well, don't tell
him I told you,

289
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,467
he made me promise.

290
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,592
She must have
treated you real bad.

291
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,683
She was a whore.

292
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:36,017
My mama was a whore.

293
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,569
But I don't fault her for that.

294
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,566
It ain't what she done

295
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,818
it's how she done it.

296
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,192
As long as I can remember

297
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,785
she'd be bringing
men up to the house.

298
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,115
My daddy was there too

299
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:56,045
but it didn't
matter none to her.

300
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,499
She'd make me watch it.

301
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,504
That's creepy.

302
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:05,463
She beat me too, a lot.

303
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,221
She beat me when
I wouldn't watch it.

304
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,098
And sometime she'd beat me

305
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,600
make me wear a dress

306
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,684
and watch her doing it.

307
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,019
And then they'd laugh at me.

308
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,525
She made you wear a dress?

309
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,732
You think I'm lying?

310
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,205
I feel like I know you.

311
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,534
Like I've known
you for a long time.

312
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,916
I feel like I've known
you for ever and ever.

313
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,755
Yeah...

314
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:52,302
I killed my mama...

315
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,599
One night,

316
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:58,057
It was my 14th birthday

317
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:00,768
and she was drunk and,

318
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,730
we had an argument.

319
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:08,568
She hit me with
a whiskey bottle.

320
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,652
And I shot her.

321
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,660
I shot her dead.

322
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,162
I thought you said
you stabbed her?

323
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,374
Oh yeah.

324
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,588
That's right.

325
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,923
I stabbed her.

326
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,275
Hey.

327
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,699
Anything good on TV?

328
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,754
I got a job today.

329
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:53,462
Oh yeah?

330
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:54,297
Doing what?

331
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,550
At a beauty parlor.

332
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,554
A beauty parlor?

333
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,135
I'm a shampoo girl.

334
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,310
What's that?

335
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:00,808
What's it sound
like, you dummy?

336
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:01,728
How the hell should I know?

337
00:28:01,729 --> 00:28:03,599
You ever seen me
in a beauty parlor?

338
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,150
I give shampoos,

339
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,465
a woman gets her hair shampooed

340
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,485
before she gets it cut

341
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,689
and I do it.

342
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,364
They pay you for that?

343
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,817
Of course they do.

344
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,380
Besides I used to
do it some back home

345
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,903
after I met Leroy.

346
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,205
Do you like it better
than dancing naked?

347
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,500
Don't start with me Otis.

348
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,827
You used to dance naked?

349
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,503
Sure, all the time
around the house.

350
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:25,750
Otis.

351
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,309
Best little naked
dancer you ever saw.

352
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,208
You never.

353
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,795
Were you really a dancer?

354
00:28:32,878 --> 00:28:34,130
I danced some,

355
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,840
in a club,

356
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:37,891
and I wasn't naked.

357
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,685
I wore a costume.

358
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,763
But I guess it
wasn't very much.

359
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,395
When you gonna dance for us?

360
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:50,025
When the pope
pees in his hat, Otis.

361
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,650
Ain't she got a mouth on her?

362
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,902
I better have something on me

363
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,858
to defend me
from a pig like you.

364
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,361
Otis.

365
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,453
Them's pretty earrings
you got on Becky.

366
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,250
Thank you Henry.

367
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,626
At least there's one
gentleman at this table.

368
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,796
Oh, I'm sorry honey,

369
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,169
now don't get mad.

370
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:11,842
I was just having
a little fun with you,

371
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,840
that's all.

372
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:14,383
Oh, wait.

373
00:29:14,384 --> 00:29:15,345
I got something to show you.

374
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,886
What?

375
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:16,801
Wait.

376
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,350
Nice.

377
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,851
Real nice.

378
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:26,853
Put it on.

379
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:27,728
Right now?

380
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,901
Okay, but turn around first.

381
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,981
Turn around.

382
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,590
Okay, you can look.

383
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,893
What does it say on there?

384
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,597
I love Chicago.

385
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,602
Looks good,

386
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:08,603
don't it Otis?

387
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,820
Oh, hey honey,

388
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,096
Why don't you bring me a beer,

389
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,904
this one's empty.

390
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:18,779
I ain't your maid,

391
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,452
get it yourself.

392
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,074
Oh, now come on honey,

393
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,371
I ain't asking you

394
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,415
to wash the windows or nothing,

395
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,412
I just want a beer.

396
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,495
Come on, bring your poor
old brother a beer, will ya?

397
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,218
Don't do that Otis,

398
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,261
she's your sister!

399
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,055
Okay, I was only
kidding around, Henry.

400
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,632
Tell her you're sorry.

401
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,763
Okay, I'm sorry.

402
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,970
Now, tell her you
won't do it again.

403
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:46,975
I won't.

404
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:50,103
I swear Becky I swear, I won't.

405
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,058
Ouch!

406
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,939
Shit, Henry!

407
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,823
Serves you right.

408
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:58,945
Thank you, Henry.

409
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,867
That's alright.

410
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,036
Listen, I'll do the dishes.

411
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,488
I don't mind.

412
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,993
I don't.

413
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,802
Listen, why don't you boys

414
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:22,927
go out and get a beer.

415
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:23,973
I'll do these,

416
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,722
I don't mind, honest.

417
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,940
Well, what do you say Otis?

418
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,903
You want to go grab a beer?

419
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,034
Sure, I don't mind.

420
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,086
I'll just go spruce up.

421
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:08,678
That was a real
nice supper, Becky.

422
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,852
Thanks.

423
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,522
Have fun.

424
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:17,478
Yeah.

425
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,934
Easy.

426
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,184
Easy.

427
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,857
Oh, come on, slow down!

428
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,113
Easy tiger, easy!

429
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,364
Slow down.

430
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,663
Now, wait a minute!

431
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,365
Hey come on, I'm not kidding!

432
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,457
Suzie?

433
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,130
Suzie!

434
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:03,425
Suzie...

435
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:39,703
Otis!

436
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:41,838
Come here,

437
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,252
I'll drive.

438
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,070
What's gonna happen
when they find those bodies?

439
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:06,937
Nothing.

440
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,235
What do you mean nothing?

441
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:09,195
Just what I said Otis,

442
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,446
nothing.

443
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,744
Nothing's gonna happen
cause nothing happened.

444
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,540
And I don't know nothing
about it whatever it is.

445
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,414
Do you?

446
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:22,336
Hey, I don't know nothing.

447
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,834
Good.

448
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,005
Oh, fuck.

449
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,940
Feeling better?

450
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,313
Yeah.

451
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,528
You want some fries?

452
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,239
You telling me you never
killed anybody before?

453
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,157
I ain't saying that.

454
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,577
Then you've killed
before, right?

455
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:38,531
Well, maybe I didn't
have no choice.

456
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:42,038
You didn't have no
choice here neither.

457
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,164
Did you?

458
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,290
Did you?

459
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,592
I don't know,

460
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,338
it ain't the same.

461
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,765
It's always the same,

462
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,389
and it's always different.

463
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,720
What do you mean?

464
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,146
It's either you or them,

465
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,145
one way or the other.

466
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,272
Ain't that right?

467
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,318
Open your eyes, Otis.

468
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,275
Look at the world.

469
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,238
It's either you or them.

470
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,039
You know what I mean.

471
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,128
Yeah.

472
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,792
Good.

473
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,170
You want a beer?

474
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,425
Okay.

475
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,660
There was only one left.

476
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,672
He knows nothing about this

477
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:15,043
but you can bet
a dollar to a doughnut

478
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,594
that when he finds out,

479
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,637
and he will find out
'cause I'll tell him

480
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:19,930
there'll be hell to pay.

481
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,839
Really.

482
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,716
I'll never go back there again

483
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,052
I can tell you that.

484
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,557
Not when he's not there anyway.

485
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:28,686
First of all there ain't two
of them that speaks English.

486
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,108
It's gone down so badly

487
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,230
the way it's changed

488
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,107
it breaks my heart.

489
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,654
It's like that all over.

490
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,652
People spit at you.

491
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,358
I wish I was lying.

492
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,841
Yeah, you can't have a regular
good time in the city no more.

493
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,444
Shit!

494
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,109
Fuck.

495
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:27,366
What did you do that for?

496
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,452
I guess I got carried away.

497
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:34,039
Well, I guess you did, Otis.

498
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:39,629
Shit, I got to have a TV.

499
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,806
Well, let's go shopping.

500
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,355
So what can I do
for you gentlemen?

501
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,523
It's hot in here, isn't it?

502
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,397
I'm kind of cold.

503
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:38,774
We want a TV.

504
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,072
How much you got to spend?

505
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,364
What do you got?

506
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,442
50 bucks.

507
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,620
I can let you have the set
over there for 50 bucks.

508
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,444
Well, turn it on

509
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,538
we want to see if it works.

510
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,332
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

511
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,331
Here plug it in down there.

512
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,665
Here?

513
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,295
Yeah, down there, real good.

514
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,377
I see you've had some college.

515
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,755
Like you can see
it works real good.

516
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,511
Just takes a while to warm up.

517
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,807
It's black and white!

518
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,556
Of course it's black and white.

519
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,182
What do you
expect for 50 bucks?

520
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,763
Fuckin' 3-D for Christ sake.

521
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,564
Well, how much is color?

522
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,983
We want color.

523
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,060
You can't get
color for 50 dollars.

524
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,440
That's okay,

525
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,646
let's see what you got.

526
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,447
What have I got?

527
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:24,490
You want cable ready?

528
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:25,817
You want remote control?

529
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,527
You want UHF?

530
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,452
You want 13"?

531
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,246
You want 19"?

532
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,039
I bet you'd like to have a 19".

533
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:34,416
You want Sony?

534
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,209
You want Zenith?

535
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:37,249
You want a Gold Star?

536
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,456
What can we get for a $150?

537
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,541
I can let you have
this set for $150.

538
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,171
It's worth $300.

539
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,548
But here, take a look at this.

540
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,096
For an extra $75,

541
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,845
you can take this $600 set.

542
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:52,560
What's this?

543
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,852
It's a camcorder.

544
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,594
What?

545
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,847
It's a videotape recorder

546
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,648
and camera rolled into one.

547
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,101
You just pop in a cassette

548
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,104
and you're ready to go.

549
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,440
You can make your
own movies with that?

550
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,613
What else would you do with it?

551
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,985
How much you want for it?

552
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,156
It's worth a grand,

553
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,529
I'd take half.

554
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,484
500 bucks?

555
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,162
Yeah, half of a grand is $500.

556
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,204
That's a little more

557
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,748
than we were planning to spend.

558
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:15,951
I think we should
just take the TV.

559
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,503
Okay, which one do you want?

560
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,667
The $50 one.

561
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,592
You guys come in here,

562
00:42:24,593 --> 00:42:25,631
I show this,

563
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,087
I show you that,

564
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,514
and you creeps got
a lousy $50 to spend.

565
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:31,466
You should have
stopped me a long time ago.

566
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,846
Take the $50 set

567
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,847
and get the hell out,

568
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:34,893
I'm a busy man.

569
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,143
Well, we were really
counting on a color set.

570
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:38,937
What's the matter,

571
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:40,604
You got shit in your ears?

572
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,060
The black and white is $50,

573
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,440
take it or leave it.

574
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,896
Sorry we wasted your time,

575
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:45,775
come on, Otis.

576
00:42:45,776 --> 00:42:49,026
Don't give me
sorry, you dumb ass!

577
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,234
Did I stutter?

578
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,320
Gimme the $50 and get out!

579
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,163
I'll give you 50...

580
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,921
No!

581
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,769
Otis,

582
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,525
Plug it in.

583
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:48,214
Oh get out of here
you're so ugly.

584
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,590
Lurleen, here's
your Uncle Otis.

585
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,718
Hi Lurleen, hi honey,

586
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,515
how are you,
hi it's Uncle Otis.

587
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,309
Henry come dance with me.

588
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,432
Come on, come on, just dance.

589
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,683
Who me?

590
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:00,512
Yeah.

591
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:01,139
No, no, no.

592
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,393
Come on Henry.

593
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,567
Come on do it Henry.

594
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,270
All right lets go.

595
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:08,525
That's it.

596
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,775
Get down.

597
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,781
Wig it as they say here.

598
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,999
More, more,

599
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,334
come on, go for it...

600
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:30,634
come on Henry, that's it,

601
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,427
that's it...

602
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:33,012
Work them hands, Henry.

603
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,966
That's it, that's it.

604
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,050
Lo and behold, what a guy.

605
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:41,388
Come on, come on,
see look how good it is.

606
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,814
Right there yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,891
Come on,

608
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,976
more, more!

609
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,606
More!

610
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,778
More damn it!

611
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,276
Fight your own battles.

612
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,323
Get this...

613
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,995
Turn it off!

614
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,000
Turn it off!

615
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,046
I want more,

616
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:08,839
just a little bit more.

617
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,798
All right.

618
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,798
That's it, that's it,
just a little bit,

619
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:13,678
all right that's it.

620
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:14,925
Hi baby.

621
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,802
Come on Henry, say hi.

622
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:17,714
No.

623
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,339
Say hi, Henry.

624
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,183
No more, Otis.

625
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,176
Say hi, Henry.

626
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,556
No more, Otis!

627
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,853
He doesn't want to.

628
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,725
Say hi baby.

629
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,181
I said hi.

630
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,818
Yeah?

631
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,481
Look I'll do the best I can,

632
00:45:38,486 --> 00:45:40,159
but I don't promise...

633
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:41,785
Fuck him.

634
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,662
Yeah, yeah, good-bye.

635
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,334
Crazy guy!

636
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,376
What?

637
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,251
Some jerk off hasn't
been out of jail six months,

638
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:49,794
gets drunk,

639
00:45:49,795 --> 00:45:51,041
gets busted up in a fight.

640
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,466
So he goes home and gets a gun

641
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,669
and comes back later
and shoots the guy.

642
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:55,376
They find the gun on him.

643
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,971
He claims he was framed.

644
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,719
What are you going to do?

645
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,517
So, everything going okay?

646
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,388
Yeah.

647
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,134
Okay,

648
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,729
You still working at Bobs Gas?

649
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:06,772
Yes sir.

650
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,100
Good, you working everyday?

651
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,730
Two, three days a week.

652
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:11,732
It's a little slow now.

653
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,905
Well, if it's less than
two days a week let me know.

654
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,260
We'll see what
we can do for you.

655
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,237
You still living
at 1801 West North?

656
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:18,738
Yes sir.

657
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,401
Good.

658
00:46:19,402 --> 00:46:20,779
I got to cut it
short today, Otis.

659
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,704
My kid's scheduled
for oral surgery.

660
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,781
I promised to take him over.

661
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:24,911
Sure.

662
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,540
Good, I'll see you next month.

663
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,416
Take it easy.

664
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,872
Bye.

665
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:52,810
You got it?

666
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,315
Got what?

667
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,988
You know what.

668
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,109
Here you go.

669
00:47:01,736 --> 00:47:02,988
You wanna try it?

670
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,210
God damn, you son of a bitch!

671
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,261
Fuckin'...!

672
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,093
Damn it!

673
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,810
Fucker.

674
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,347
Let me see that.

675
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,559
That little fuckin' bastard.

676
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:33,481
I ought to kill him.

677
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:34,898
I ought to cut his
fuckin' head off.

678
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,820
That'd be a mistake.

679
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,069
Look who's talking.

680
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,652
Watch your mouth Otis.

681
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,703
I'm sorry, Henry.

682
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:45,826
You kill that high school boy

683
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:47,122
they're going to slap your ass

684
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,541
right back in jail.

685
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:50,368
Otis that's a promise.

686
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,920
People have seen you together.

687
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,123
I'd still like
to kill him though.

688
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,833
I bet you would.

689
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,260
I'd like to kill somebody.

690
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,838
Say that again.

691
00:48:01,921 --> 00:48:03,889
I'd like to kill somebody.

692
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,932
Let's me and you
go for a ride Otis.

693
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,895
Here, I want to
show you something.

694
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,150
Where'd you get this?

695
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,276
Careful Otis,

696
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:45,357
it's loaded.

697
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:46,533
Where'd you get it?

698
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,486
Guns are easy to get.

699
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,490
I can make a phone call

700
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:50,825
and get a gun.

701
00:49:50,905 --> 00:49:52,623
Anybody can get a gun Otis.

702
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,450
What do you got in mind Henry?

703
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,035
What do you think?

704
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,753
I don't know.

705
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,459
Put up the hood.

706
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,338
Why?

707
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,546
Just put up the hood, Otis.

708
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:53,263
You guys need any help?

709
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,561
Otis, do you need some help,

710
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,640
or can you do it yourself?

711
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,859
Feel better?

712
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,908
Yeah.

713
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,285
Alright.

714
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:29,136
If you shoot somebody

715
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,554
in the head with a 45

716
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,506
every time you kill somebody

717
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,309
it becomes like
your fingerprint see.

718
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:36,806
But if you strangle one

719
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,932
and stab another,

720
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:39,229
one you cut up

721
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:40,431
one you don't

722
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,642
then the police
don't know what to do.

723
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:45,148
They think you're
four different people.

724
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,104
What they really like,

725
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,235
what makes their
job so much easier,

726
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:51,192
a pattern.

727
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:54,620
What they call
a modus operandi.

728
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,117
That's Latin.

729
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,119
Bet you didn't know
any Latin, did ya?

730
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,122
Big fuckin' deal.

731
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,168
What?

732
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,962
Nothing.

733
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,799
It's like a trail
of shit, Otis.

734
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,127
It's like a blood droppings

735
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,052
from a deer you've shot

736
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,095
and all they gotta do

737
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,343
is follow those droppings

738
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,222
and pretty soon they're
going to find that deer.

739
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:31,236
Why do we use a gun?

740
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,158
You can use a gun.

741
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,031
I'm not saying
you can't use a gun.

742
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,239
Just don't use
the same gun twice.

743
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,335
The most important
thing is to keep moving.

744
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,290
That way they might
never catch up to you.

745
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,373
I'm gonna have to pack up

746
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,172
and be on the move
too, pretty soon.

747
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,218
Where are you going?

748
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,591
Nowhere.

749
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,015
You wanna come?

750
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,685
We could be back this
way in about a month.

751
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,228
I'm not supposed
to leave the state

752
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,143
without telling them.

753
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,146
So who's gonna know?

754
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,223
As long as you show up

755
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,308
when you're supposed to?

756
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:09,191
What if they check
up on me at work?

757
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,899
Well, no plan is perfect.

758
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,131
Bring her in.

759
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,082
Bring her in Otis.

760
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,213
Come on.

761
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,965
That's it.

762
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:15,760
Yeah, yeah.

763
00:54:15,761 --> 00:54:16,419
Sit down.

764
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,388
Sit her down.

765
00:54:18,464 --> 00:54:19,511
Oh, good, good,
good, good, good.

766
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,466
Take her blouse off.

767
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,641
Take it off.

768
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,853
Oh yeah, Otis, good.

769
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,351
My oh, yeah, yeah.

770
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,058
Skirt, skirt, skirt.

771
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:29,767
Do it Otis,

772
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:30,984
you're a star.

773
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,196
Shut up!

774
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:47,201
I'll do what the hell
I want to do bitch!

775
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,254
Leave me alone!

776
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,251
Do it Otis.

777
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,707
Do it.

778
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:54,633
Henry look.

779
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,381
You got it.

780
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,677
Go for it boy.

781
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,932
Shut up!

782
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,303
Get the fuckin' kid!

783
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:33,372
Son of a bitch!

784
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,002
Henry, look!

785
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:03,618
Hey Henry?

786
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,037
Henry?

787
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,369
What?

788
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,290
Hi!

789
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,242
Looky here, where you at.

790
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,158
Bye!

791
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:11,876
Where you at?

792
00:56:11,877 --> 00:56:13,587
Say hello, honey!

793
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,380
I have to wave to my baby.

794
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,422
Henry, bye.

795
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,296
Henry, look at this, Henry.

796
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,752
Ain't that a view.

797
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:22,512
Otis!

798
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:24,135
No, Otis!

799
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,511
Otis!

800
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,639
No!

801
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:29,846
Let's go!

802
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,242
What are you doing?

803
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,994
I want to see it again.

804
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:28,653
In jail?

805
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:30,122
Are you sure?

806
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,669
Is Lurleen there?

807
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,337
Does she know?

808
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,170
In the what,

809
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,000
in the army?

810
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,462
Go get her, will you?

811
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:53,228
Hi.

812
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,021
Hi, hi.

813
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,602
Do you miss me?

814
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,904
I miss you.

815
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,280
You did?

816
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,488
That's wonderful.

817
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,413
Are you being a good girl?

818
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,163
I don't think so honey.

819
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,466
I know I promised, but...

820
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,090
a couple of things
have happened here.

821
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:31,593
I know, he is a good soldier.

822
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,731
Soon, real soon, I promise.

823
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:42,861
I love you, too.

824
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,698
Yeah, put your
grandma back on, okay?

825
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,578
Hi.

826
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,287
I know.

827
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,913
I'll think about it.

828
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:04,166
I can't right now.

829
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,626
I will, soon.

830
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,380
I can't talk now okay,

831
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,807
I gotta go.

832
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,475
Okay.

833
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:14,802
Bye.

834
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:22,521
Great, great.

835
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,107
I got one,
I got one, here, look.

836
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,033
Oh, look, look,
look, look, look.

837
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:30,950
Look at this, look at this.

838
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,494
Tight on there.

839
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,741
Yeah, no, no, no,

840
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:34,912
oh, no, I like this one better.

841
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,036
Look Henry, Henry look.

842
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,241
Oh, yeah, I love it,

843
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:39,116
I love her.

844
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,084
Oh god, how she looks,

845
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,582
isn't she pretty.

846
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,038
God, look at that dress,

847
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,589
look at the way it moves.

848
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,257
Oh yeah!

849
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:48,381
Pull up next to her, real slow.

850
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,677
Look what you did!

851
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,928
Oh God!

852
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,009
Oh Jesus!

853
00:59:57,969 --> 00:59:59,721
Look at it, it's ruined.

854
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:02,308
Damn Henry you ought to
look where you're driving.

855
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,059
Who the hell told you

856
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:04,981
to stick your head
out the window anyway?

857
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,061
You could have killed me!

858
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,270
Oh, that's right.

859
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:10,073
Blame it on me!

860
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,527
Oh, this fucking camera!

861
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,079
What did you do that for?

862
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,997
It wasn't any good anymore.

863
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:19,416
Could have fixed it.

864
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,744
Shit, the lens was
busted right off!

865
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:22,703
Could have fixed it!

866
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:23,628
How do you know,

867
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,673
you a camera repair man.

868
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:27,749
You should have said something.

869
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,255
You didn't give
me a chance, Otis.

870
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,177
You threw the fucker
right out the window.

871
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:32,675
It ain't my fault it broke.

872
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,472
Oh right.

873
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,226
Go back and get it if you want.

874
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:39,518
Yeah.

875
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,694
Want to get a beer?

876
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,693
Not particularly.

877
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,524
I want a beer.

878
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,745
If you want a
beer so bad, Otis,

879
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,790
go ahead and get one.

880
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,788
All right, I will.

881
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:06,541
See you later.

882
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:07,998
Yeah.

883
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:16,674
I talked to Lurleen.

884
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,804
Yeah?

885
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,387
You'd like her.

886
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:24,313
God, I miss her.

887
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,891
I'm thinking,

888
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:29,695
I might be
heading on back home.

889
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:31,316
I quit.

890
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,148
You quit what?

891
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,618
My job.

892
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:37,740
What happened?

893
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,786
Nothing.

894
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:41,706
I just figured it
was time to go home.

895
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,046
You want to come with me?

896
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,419
I thought you wanted
to make some money?

897
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:53,377
Yeah, but,

898
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,757
I'm thinking,

899
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,134
I don't want to bring
Lurleen up here after all.

900
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,057
You know,
that was my intention.

901
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,479
There's just too
much going on up here.

902
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,227
She'd get lost.

903
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:13,697
We're better off
living with mama.

904
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,774
I can work back home,

905
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,736
I won't make as much
money I'm sure, but,

906
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,820
I won't need <i>as</i> much either.

907
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:25,410
And I can live with mama.

908
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:29,838
You can stay there, too.

909
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,961
You figure it's
safe to go back?

910
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:34,759
I hope so.

911
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,177
Leroy's in jail for murder

912
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,052
and his bond's
a million dollars.

913
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,553
So, unless he wins the lottery

914
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:46,104
Leroy won't be going
anywhere for quite a while.

915
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,853
Where's Otis?

916
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:52,311
He had a dinner
date I think he said.

917
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,941
Really?

918
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:55,237
Well.

919
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,693
Come with me?

920
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,653
When are you leaving?

921
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:04,865
Tomorrow.

922
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:13,165
Better think fast Henry.

923
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,966
You got your ticket?

924
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,918
Not yet.

925
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,721
But my mind's made up.

926
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,798
Might as well just do it.

927
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:27,721
Might as well.

928
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,182
I'd rather ride with you.

929
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,361
Let me think about it.

930
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,741
I'll tell you what,

931
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:40,863
let's me and you

932
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,239
go get us a steak dinner,

933
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,946
I'm buying.

934
01:03:44,029 --> 01:03:46,873
I got a new Visa card
I want to try out.

935
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:48,245
You've got a Visa card?

936
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:51,955
Yeah, who you think you're
associating with anyway?

937
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,540
Great, let's go.

938
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,456
Alright.

939
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,834
Where are we going?

940
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:58,589
We'll find a place.

941
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,180
Grab your jacket and let's go.

942
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,986
I gotta go to the bathroom.

943
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,237
Okay.

944
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,965
He's passed out.

945
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,031
I ain't
interrupting nothing, am I?

946
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:50,997
You guys want a beer?

947
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,039
You got any cigarettes?

948
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,086
Not since Superman died.

949
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,589
I gotta, go out and
get some cigarettes,

950
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:04,339
get some air.

951
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,169
Henry?

952
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,046
I'll be right back I promise,

953
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:07,551
I just need some air.

954
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,973
Henry.

955
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,470
You want anything?

956
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,938
Otis?

957
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,826
How about getting your
poor ol' brother a beer?

958
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:21,167
Hi.

959
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,213
Two packs of Kools.

960
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,038
What kind?

961
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,040
What?

962
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:24,794
What kind?

963
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:26,964
Milds, Regulars, 100's...

964
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,260
Regulars.

965
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,014
Two, sixty.

966
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:41,099
Hey, how about those Bears?

967
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:43,025
Fuck the Bears.

968
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,483
Okay.

969
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:03,129
Hi.

970
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,172
That's a nice looking
dog you got there.

971
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:06,295
Thank you.

972
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,217
What kind is it?

973
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:09,419
Heinz.

974
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,549
What?

975
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,881
57 varieties.

976
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,181
What?

977
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,554
It's a mutt,

978
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,260
half Yorkshire, half Shitzu.

979
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:20,472
Shitzu.

980
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:21,852
What's his name?

981
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:23,308
Delores.

982
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:24,141
What?

983
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,112
Her name is Delores.

984
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:30,235
That's a nice name.

985
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,612
Hear that Delores?

986
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,318
Say thank you.

987
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:36,867
We gotta go.

988
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,448
Bye now.

989
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:42,179
Come here,
come here, come here.

990
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,485
No!

991
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,779
You god damn bitch.

992
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,178
You son of a...

993
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,559
Adios, mother fucker!

994
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,299
Relax, take it easy.

995
01:11:36,501 --> 01:11:38,299
No, no, no, easy.

996
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,050
Why don't you call the police?

997
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,221
No, no, no.

998
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:42,046
What about Otis?

999
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:42,924
It's not a good idea.

1000
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,475
No.

1001
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,893
What are we going to do?

1002
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:48,221
Shut up, let me think!

1003
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,430
Shut up!

1004
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:52,433
Let me think!

1005
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,772
Let me think!

1006
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:09,556
You want to
listen to the radio?

1007
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:12,679
Henry.

1008
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,261
That was so awful.

1009
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,724
I'm scared.

1010
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,565
What do we do now?

1011
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,944
We just got to keep moving,

1012
01:15:28,024 --> 01:15:31,619
that's for sure.

1013
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:32,574
My sister owns a ranch

1014
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,740
outside San Bernardino.

1015
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:38,497
She raises horses there.

1016
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:41,079
She's got about
1/2 dozen of them.

1017
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:42,209
Arabians.

1018
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,711
They're beautiful.

1019
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:49,591
<i>We can stay there
as long as we want to.</i>

1020
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:53,220
What about Lurleen?

1021
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:54,221
We'll send for her,

1022
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:58,646
soon as we get there.

1023
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,770
You promise?

1024
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,897
I promise.

1025
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,574
I love you Henry.

1026
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,166
I guess, I love you too.

1027
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:30,086
Where are we going to go now?

1028
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:32,092
We'll find a place.

1029
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:42,682
You want to
listen to the radio?

1030
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,360
Okay.

1031
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,735
This is a nice guitar.

1032
01:18:19,820 --> 01:18:22,243
I used to play a little.

1033
01:18:22,323 --> 01:18:24,872
But, I'm out of practice.

1034
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,966
We better go to bed now.
