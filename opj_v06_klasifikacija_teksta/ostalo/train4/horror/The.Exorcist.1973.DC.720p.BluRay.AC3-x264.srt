1
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,280
Sure do love you.

2
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:30,910
-Morning.
-Good morning, Mrs. MacNeil.

3
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:32,990
-How are you today?
-Fine, thank you.

4
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,450
That's good.

5
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,370
It's okay, I've got it. Thanks.

6
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,080
-Good morning, madam.
-Good morning, Karl.

7
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,170
Oh, Karl, we've got rats in the attic.
You'd better get some traps.

8
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,670
-Rats?
-I'm afraid so.

9
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,135
But the attic is clean.

10
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,052
All right, then, we've got clean rats.

11
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,514
-No, no. No rats.
-I just heard them, Karl.

12
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:55,932
Maybe plumbing.

13
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,269
Yeah, or maybe rats.
Now, will you just get the traps?

14
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:00,687
Yes, I go now.

15
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:02,730
Don't go now.
The stores aren't open yet.

16
00:13:02,898 --> 00:13:04,649
-I'll go see.
-They're closed!

17
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,277
In the group over here...

18
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,696
...I need a priest, a nun
and two students.

19
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,200
That's what we want.
That's exactly what we want.

20
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:19,706
Burke. Oh, Burke.

21
00:13:19,874 --> 00:13:21,708
-Is this scene really essential?
-Chris.

22
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,668
Just consider if we can do without it.

23
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,671
Take a look at this damn thing.
It just doesn't make sense.

24
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,717
It's plain. You're a teacher of the college.
You don't want the building torn down.

25
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:34,137
-Come on. I can read, for Christ's sake.
-Well, what's wrong?

26
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:36,556
Well, why are they tearing
the building down?

27
00:13:36,724 --> 00:13:39,726
Shall we summon the writer?
He's in Paris, I believe.

28
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:41,060
- Hiding?
- Fucking.

29
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:46,733
Hotel. Take four.

30
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:49,736
All right. Hustle, background. And action.

31
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,404
Hasn't there been enough killing?

32
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,616
Is this your campus?

33
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:59,078
Get the Defense Department
off this campus!

34
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,916
It's our school!

35
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,084
-You have no rights!
- Hypocrite!

36
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,212
Military complex, man!

37
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,130
And action, Chris.

38
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:11,341
I've seen enough killing in my lifetime!

39
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:15,011
There's no need for it!

40
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:20,391
That's right! That's right!

41
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,437
We're all concerned with human rights,
for God's sake...

42
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:27,440
...but the kids who want
to get an education have a right too!

43
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:36,783
Don't you understand? It's against
your own principle, for God's sake!

44
00:14:39,453 --> 00:14:42,622
You can't accomplish anything by
shutting kids off from their....

45
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:51,047
If you want-- Hold it, hold it!
Quiet!

46
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,634
If you want to effect any change,
you have to do it within the system.

47
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:00,223
Okay, cut. That's a wrap.

48
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,449
-I'll walk home tonight.
-Okay.

49
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,077
Here, take that
and drop it at my house, yeah?

50
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:23,079
-Good night, Tom.
- Good night.

51
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:03,578
There's not a day in my life
that I don't feel like a fraud.

52
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,039
I mean, priests, doctors, lawyers.
I've talked to them all.

53
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,083
I don't know anyone who hasn't
felt that.

54
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:16,382
Hello?

55
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,967
In here.

56
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,846
-Hi. How did your day go?
-Oh, not too bad.

57
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,308
It was like the, uh, Walt Disney version
of the Ho Chi Minh story.

58
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:26,726
Other than that, terrific.

59
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:29,520
-What we got, anything exciting?
-Here.

60
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,231
-Oh, all right.
-And also, you got an invitation.

61
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,942
-What's this?
-Dinner at the White House.

62
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,362
You're kidding.
Is it a big party or something?

63
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,821
I think it's five or six people.

64
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:41,824
Oh. Thursday, huh? All right.

65
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:43,034
Hi, Mom.

66
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,036
What'd you do today?

67
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,871
-Stuff.
-What's that mean, stuff?

68
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,875
Well, uh, me and Sharon played a game
in the backyard.

69
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,378
-You did.
-And we had a picnic down by the river.

70
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,380
That sounds good.

71
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,589
You should have seen.

72
00:16:56,757 --> 00:16:59,759
This man came along on this
beautiful gray horse.

73
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,636
-Really? What kind?
-Wasn't he pretty?

74
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:03,888
Was it a mare, a gelding, what?

75
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,099
-I think it was a gelding.
-Mm-hm.

76
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:08,893
It was gray. Oh, it was so beautiful.

77
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,312
The guy let me ride it all around
and everything.

78
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,481
-You're kidding.
- She rode for half an hour.

79
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:18,569
It was so nice. Oh, I loved it.
Oh, Mom, can't we get a horse?

80
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:22,115
-Not while we're in Washington, honey.
-Why not, Mom? Ha, ha.

81
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:24,117
We'll see when we get home, okay?

82
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:26,911
-When could I have one?
-We'll see, Regan. We'll see.

83
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,289
Hey, listen, on the party invitations,
I wanted to write a personal--

84
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:33,209
-Regan, don't! Regan, come back here!
-Ha-ha-ha.

85
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,299
- All right, give it up. Give it up!
- No!

86
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,427
Ooh!
Ha-ha-ha.

87
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,220
-You'll be sorry! Come on.
-No!

88
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:16,502
Father?

89
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,130
Could you help an old altar boy?

90
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,339
I'm a Catholic.

91
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,531
All right, come on, man.

92
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,909
- What, are you crazy?
- Go ahead.

93
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,594
Mama?

94
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:00,398
Mama?

95
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,775
Mama?

96
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:06,946
Dimmy! Dimmy!

97
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,285
Oh, how are you, Mama?

98
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,620
-I'm so glad to see you.
-You look good.

99
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:16,497
I'm all right.

100
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:19,125
-How's your leg?
-How about you? You are all right?

101
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:20,626
I'm fine, Mama. I'm fine.

102
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,885
Your Uncle John passed by to visit me.

103
00:20:29,052 --> 00:20:31,387
Oh, really? When?
-Last month.

104
00:20:35,976 --> 00:20:38,311
-Too tight?
-No.

105
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:43,399
You have to stay off it. You can't go up and
down the stairs. You have to give it a rest.

106
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:44,984
Okay.

107
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,915
I could take you somewhere where
you'd be safe. You wouldn't be alone.

108
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,877
There would be people around. You
wouldn't be sitting here listening to a radio.

109
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:08,883
You understand me?

110
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:13,763
This is my house
and I'm not going no place.

111
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,861
Dimmy, you worry for something?

112
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,030
-No, Mama.
-You are not happy?

113
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:32,949
Tell me, what is the matter?

114
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:36,285
Mama, I'm all right. I'm fine.
Really, I am.

115
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,988
Here it comes.

116
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:13,489
There.

117
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,994
-Oh, look at that.
-Do you like it?

118
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,913
Aw, isn't that funny? Ha, ha.

119
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,750
I better put him over here to dry, though.
He's still wet.

120
00:22:24,918 --> 00:22:27,211
Oh, here we go.

121
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:29,922
There, he can dry there.

122
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,258
Hey, where'd this come from?

123
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,845
-I found it.
-Where?

124
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:38,597
Closet.

125
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:41,142
Huh.

126
00:22:41,351 --> 00:22:42,935
You been playing with it?

127
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:45,104
-Yup.
-Do you know how?

128
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,106
I'll show you.

129
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:52,778
Wait a minute. You need two.

130
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:56,240
No, you don't. I do it all the time.

131
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,617
Oh, yeah? Well, let's both play with it.

132
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:02,955
You really don't want me to play, huh?

133
00:23:03,123 --> 00:23:06,333
No, I do. Captain Howdy said no.

134
00:23:06,501 --> 00:23:09,462
-Captain who?
-Captain Howdy.

135
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:11,130
Who's Captain Howdy?

136
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:15,009
You know. I make the questions
and he does the answers.

137
00:23:15,177 --> 00:23:18,846
-Oh, Captain Howdy. Yeah, I see.
-He's nice.

138
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:20,973
Oh, I'll bet he is.

139
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:23,976
-Here, I'll show you.
-All right.

140
00:23:24,144 --> 00:23:28,147
Captain Howdy,
do you think my mom's pretty?

141
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,109
Captain Howdy?

142
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,361
Captain Howdy, that isn't very nice.

143
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:37,031
-Well, maybe he's sleeping.
-You think?

144
00:23:39,076 --> 00:23:41,911
Regan, why are you reading that stuff?

145
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,329
Because I like it.

146
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:46,248
It's not even a good picture of you.
Look at that.

147
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,001
-You look so mature.
-I wouldn't talk.

148
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:52,171
You wouldn't talk?
Well, I didn't know they were taking it.

149
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,340
I didn't have my makeup man there.

150
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:57,176
Let me take an eyelash off your face.

151
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:59,512
Okay. No, I didn't get it.

152
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:01,931
-Mm.
-What are we gonna do on your birthday?

153
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:04,975
Isn't it nice it's on Sunday this year?

154
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:07,269
No work? What can we do?

155
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:08,479
I don't know.

156
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:09,897
Well, what would you like to do?

157
00:24:10,065 --> 00:24:11,982
-Got any ideas?
-Mm-mm.

158
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,818
Hmm?

159
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:16,821
Let me think. Let me think.
What can we do?

160
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,698
Hey, we never finished seeing all the sights
in Washington.

161
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:22,201
Didn't get to Lee Mansion
and lots of stuff.

162
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:25,871
Shall we do that? Go sightseeing?
If it's a nice day?

163
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,165
-Yeah, let's do that.
-Okay.

164
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:33,754
And tomorrow night,
I'll take you to a movie. Okay?

165
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:35,840
Oh, I love you.

166
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,551
I love you, Rags.

167
00:24:41,138 --> 00:24:42,263
We'll have a good day, yeah?

168
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:45,349
You can bring Mr. Dennings, if you like.

169
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,143
Mr. Dennings?

170
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,395
Well, you know, it's okay.

171
00:24:49,563 --> 00:24:50,855
Well, thank you very much...

172
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:54,024
...but why on earth would I wanna bring
Burke on your birthday?

173
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,734
Well, you like him.

174
00:24:55,902 --> 00:24:59,864
Yeah, I like him. Don't you like him?
Hey, what's going on? What is this?

175
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:03,534
-You're gonna marry him, aren't you?
-Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

176
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,369
-What?
-Me marry Burke Dennings?

177
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:07,663
Don't be silly. Of course not.

178
00:25:07,831 --> 00:25:09,748
Where did you ever get an idea like that?

179
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,917
But you like him.

180
00:25:12,085 --> 00:25:15,921
Of course I like him. I like pizzas too,
but I'm not gonna marry one.

181
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:18,340
You don't like him like Daddy?

182
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:21,760
Regan, I love your daddy.

183
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:24,180
I'll always love your daddy, honey.

184
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:27,933
Okay? Burke just comes
around here a lot, because...

185
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,770
...well, he's lonely.
He don't got nothing to do.

186
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:35,024
Well, I heard differently.

187
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:37,526
Oh, you did? What did you hear, huh?

188
00:25:37,694 --> 00:25:40,446
-I don't know. I just thought.
-Come on. What did you hear?

189
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:42,281
Well, you didn't think so good.

190
00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:44,658
-How do you know? Ha, ha.
-Ha-ha-ha.

191
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:47,494
Because Burke and I are just friends.
Okay? Really.

192
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:48,787
Okay.

193
00:25:49,164 --> 00:25:51,207
You ready for sleep?

194
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:56,045
-Good night.
-Good night, honey.

195
00:25:56,463 --> 00:26:00,758
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

196
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:06,472
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man

197
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,692
It's my mother, Tom.

198
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:21,862
She's alone. I never should have left her.

199
00:26:23,323 --> 00:26:26,325
At least in New York, I'd be near her.
I'd be close to her.

200
00:26:26,493 --> 00:26:29,161
I could see about a transfer, Damien.

201
00:26:30,872 --> 00:26:35,584
I need reassignment, Tom. I want out of
this job. It's wrong, it's no good.

202
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:37,836
You're the best we've got.

203
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:40,714
Am I really?

204
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:45,344
It's more than psychiatry,
and you know that, Tom.

205
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:48,305
Some of their problems come down
to faith...

206
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:52,017
...their vocation, the meaning of their lives,
and I can't cut it anymore.

207
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,566
I need out. I'm unfit.

208
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,698
Think I've lost my faith, Tom.

209
00:27:09,202 --> 00:27:10,202
Hello?

210
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,871
Yes, this is Mrs. MacNeil.

211
00:27:13,081 --> 00:27:14,999
Operator, you have got to be kidding!

212
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:18,127
I have been on this line for 20 minutes!

213
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:20,587
Jesus Christ. Can you believe this?

214
00:27:20,755 --> 00:27:23,549
He doesn't even call his daughter
on her birthday.

215
00:27:23,717 --> 00:27:26,010
-Maybe the circuit is busy.
-Oh, circuits, my ass!

216
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,553
He doesn't give a shit.

217
00:27:27,721 --> 00:27:31,181
-Why don't you let me--?
-No, I've got it, Sharon. It's all right.

218
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,310
Yes. No, operator,
don't tell me there's no answer.

219
00:27:34,477 --> 00:27:36,270
It's the Hotel Excelsior in Rome.

220
00:27:36,479 --> 00:27:39,064
Would you try it again, please,
and let it ring?

221
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:41,233
Hello? Yes.

222
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:46,113
No, operator,
I've given you the number four times.

223
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:49,658
Do you take an illiteracy test to get
that job, for Christ's sakes?

224
00:27:49,826 --> 00:27:52,202
Don't tell me to be calm, goddamn it!

225
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,381
Yeah?

226
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,676
You're kidding me.

227
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,057
Okay. I thought I just went to bed.

228
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,726
Yeah.

229
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:18,645
Hey, what are we doing, scene 61 ?

230
00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:22,816
Okay. Oh, just remind Flo about
that blue belt, huh?

231
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:24,943
All right. Yeah, I'll see you.

232
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,000
What are you doing here?

233
00:28:40,168 --> 00:28:42,544
My bed was shaking.

234
00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:44,755
I can't get to sleep.

235
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,965
Oh, honey.

236
00:30:07,714 --> 00:30:09,506
Goddamn it.

237
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:14,636
Jesus.

238
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,801
There's nothing.

239
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:57,054
Oh, Karl.

240
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:00,390
Jesus Christ, Karl, don't do that.

241
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,018
Very sorry, but you see, no rats.

242
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:05,896
No rats. Thanks a lot. That's terrific.

243
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:15,257
Oh, my God.

244
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,361
Okay. Unroll your fist.

245
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:38,363
Arm up.

246
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:41,283
Very good. That wasn't so bad, was it?

247
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:44,453
Remain perfectly still. Breathe normally.

248
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:00,385
Tell me if you feel a vibration.

249
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:03,347
Regan?

250
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:09,561
You feel anything?

251
00:33:10,647 --> 00:33:12,564
Can you feel this?

252
00:33:12,732 --> 00:33:14,691
I don't feel anything.

253
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,699
Put this in your mouth.

254
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:25,243
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.

255
00:33:25,411 --> 00:33:28,789
When the red light goes on,
that's your temperature.

256
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:31,208
I don't want it.

257
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,786
A disorder of the nerves.

258
00:34:07,954 --> 00:34:09,413
At least we think it is.

259
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,498
We don't know yet exactly how it works.

260
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:14,126
It's often seen in early adolescence.

261
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:15,752
She shows all the symptoms.

262
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,796
Hyperactivity.

263
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,548
Her temper.

264
00:34:20,466 --> 00:34:21,967
Performance in math.

265
00:34:22,135 --> 00:34:24,386
Yeah. Why the math? What is that?

266
00:34:24,554 --> 00:34:26,638
It affects her concentration.

267
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:28,473
Ah-ha.

268
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:32,352
-Now, this is for Ritalin.
-Okay.

269
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,771
Ten milligrams a day.

270
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:36,523
Is that a tranquilizer?

271
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:37,858
It's a stimulant.

272
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:40,652
A stimulant? My God,
she's higher than a kite now.

273
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,613
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.

274
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,658
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic
behavior in a child.

275
00:34:46,826 --> 00:34:49,286
The Ritalin seems to work
to relieve the condition.

276
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,830
And as to how or why,
we really don't know.

277
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,334
But, uh, her symptoms could be
overreaction to depression.

278
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:58,170
That's out of my field.

279
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,922
My daughter isn't depressed.

280
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:06,011
Well, you mentioned her father
and the separation.

281
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:08,847
You think I should take her
to a psychiatrist?

282
00:35:09,015 --> 00:35:12,434
No. I think we should wait
and see what happens with the Ritalin.

283
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:14,686
I think that's the answer.

284
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:17,481
-Okay.
-Let's wait two, three weeks.

285
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:21,067
All right. And the lies she's been telling?
That's part of it, huh?

286
00:35:21,235 --> 00:35:24,654
-Lies?
-Like saying her bed's shaking. That stuff.

287
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:29,075
Have you ever known your daughter
to swear?

288
00:35:29,243 --> 00:35:32,037
-To use obscenities?
-No, never.

289
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,207
Hmm. Interesting.

290
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:40,128
Similar-- Similar to things like her lying...

291
00:35:40,296 --> 00:35:44,216
-...it's uncharacteristic for her.
-I don't understand. She doesn't swear.

292
00:35:45,218 --> 00:35:48,678
Well, she let loose quite a string
while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.

293
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:53,058
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?

294
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:57,729
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.

295
00:35:57,897 --> 00:36:00,065
Well, give me an example. Like what?

296
00:36:00,233 --> 00:36:02,442
Specifically, what did she say?

297
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,402
Specifically, Mrs. MacNeil...

298
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:08,740
...she advised me to keep my fingers
away from her...

299
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:11,743
...goddamn cunt.

300
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:18,542
I can't believe it.

301
00:36:22,004 --> 00:36:24,422
-She--
-You don't think a psychiatrist...?

302
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,426
No. I think the best explanation
is always the simplest.

303
00:36:28,594 --> 00:36:32,180
-Well, we'll wait. We'll wait and see.
-Yeah.

304
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,600
So in the meantime...

305
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,352
...try not to worry.

306
00:36:38,521 --> 00:36:40,105
How?

307
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:44,526
The edema affected her brain,
you understand?

308
00:36:44,694 --> 00:36:46,570
She don't let no doctor come near her.

309
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,155
She was all the time screaming,
talking to the radio.

310
00:36:49,323 --> 00:36:51,908
-You should've called me when it happened.
-Listen.

311
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:54,077
Regular hospital not gonna
put up with that.

312
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,162
We give her a shot and bring her here...

313
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,207
...until the doctors fix up her leg,
then we take her right out.

314
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,793
Two or three months and she's out,
good as new.

315
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:09,718
-Miss?
-Yes?

316
00:37:09,886 --> 00:37:11,136
We want to see Mrs. Karras.

317
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:12,846
-Do you have an appointment?
-Yes.

318
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:16,057
-Are you a relative?
-Yes, I am her brother. He is her son.

319
00:37:16,225 --> 00:37:17,934
Just a minute.

320
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,042
You know, it's funny.

321
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,337
If you wasn't a priest, you'd be famous
psychiatrist on Park Avenue.

322
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:48,965
Your mother, she'd be living in a penthouse
instead of there.

323
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:57,057
You go in, Dimmy.
I'll wait for you outside.

324
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,646
You'll find Mrs. Karras in the last bed
on the left-hand side.

325
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,149
No, no. No, no.

326
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:09,736
Go get someone else.
Don't bother the father.

327
00:38:09,904 --> 00:38:11,571
Go to your bed. Go to your bed.

328
00:38:13,282 --> 00:38:14,532
No, no. No, no.

329
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,286
The father will be back to see you.
It's all right.

330
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:30,215
Mama.

331
00:38:30,383 --> 00:38:31,967
It's Dimmy, Mama.

332
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:37,555
Dimmy.

333
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:40,308
Why you did this to me, Dimmy?

334
00:38:40,476 --> 00:38:42,102
Why?

335
00:38:45,147 --> 00:38:47,399
Come on,
I'm gonna take you out of here, Mama.

336
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:50,068
I'm gonna take you home.
I'll get you out of here tonight, Mama.

337
00:38:52,238 --> 00:38:55,657
Mama, everything's gonna be all right.
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

338
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,827
Mama, I'm gonna take you home.

339
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,999
-Couldn't you have put her someplace else?
-Like what? Private hospital?

340
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:07,544
Who got the money for that, Dimmy?
You?

341
00:39:38,492 --> 00:39:42,287
There seems to be an alien pubic hair
in my drink.

342
00:39:42,455 --> 00:39:47,792
-I beg your pardon?
-Never seen it before in my life. Have you?

343
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:55,008
We're pretty comfortable up there compared
to the Gemini and Mercury programs.

344
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:56,384
They were tight for space.

345
00:39:56,552 --> 00:39:59,804
You see, we got about 210 cubic feet,
so we can move around.

346
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:02,098
If you ever go up there again,
will you take me along?

347
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,309
Ha-ha-ha. What for?

348
00:40:04,477 --> 00:40:05,769
First missionary on Mars.

349
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:11,232
Tell me, was it public relations you did
for the Gestapo or community relations?

350
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,985
-I'm Swiss.
-Yes, of course.

351
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,281
And you never went bowling with Goebbels,
either, I suppose, eh?

352
00:40:18,824 --> 00:40:20,658
Nazi bastard.

353
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:23,036
Over behind the church.
You know where I mean?

354
00:40:23,204 --> 00:40:25,622
-It's a red brick wing.
-Saint Mike's.

355
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,750
What goes on there?
Who's the priest I keep seeing there?

356
00:40:28,918 --> 00:40:32,712
He's there all the time. He has black hair.
He's very intense looking. Who's that?

357
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,005
-Damien Karras.
-Karras?

358
00:40:34,173 --> 00:40:39,427
That's his office, back of Saint Mike's.
He's our-- Our psychiatric counselor.

359
00:40:40,513 --> 00:40:44,015
He had a pretty rough knock last night,
poor guy. His mother passed away.

360
00:40:44,183 --> 00:40:46,559
She was living by herself...

361
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:50,480
...and I guess she was dead
a couple of days before they found her.

362
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:54,317
Cunting Hun.

363
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:58,363
Bloody, damned, butchering Nazi pig.

364
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,783
Stop it! I'll kill you!

365
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,045
What's the matter with you?

366
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:15,880
What's for dessert?

367
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:25,557
You sleeping?

368
00:41:34,108 --> 00:41:35,275
You get some sleep.

369
00:41:38,154 --> 00:41:43,074
Okay. Very good. All right.

370
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:47,704
Listen, Burke, your car's at the curb.
Louie's waiting. It's nice and warm.

371
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:58,006
Yes, honey. What?

372
00:41:59,341 --> 00:42:00,466
Fuck it.

373
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:10,894
-I've never seen him acting up.
-Really. Blind is what he was.

374
00:42:14,607 --> 00:42:19,277
Down on Thoity-Thoid and Thoid

375
00:42:19,445 --> 00:42:22,447
-Hi, Chris. This is a great party.
-Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.

376
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:26,784
I don't need any encouragement. My idea
of heaven is a solid white nightclub...

377
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:30,955
...with me as a headliner for all eternity,
and they love me.

378
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:35,293
Down on the east side

379
00:42:35,461 --> 00:42:37,587
Of Thoity-Thoid and Thoid

380
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:43,635
That's my home sweet home

381
00:42:44,136 --> 00:42:49,682
Some people think
It's the home of black eyes

382
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,684
Just because--

383
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:54,145
Hey, I think we've got a guest.

384
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,982
You're gonna die up there.

385
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:07,325
Regan?

386
00:43:07,493 --> 00:43:09,244
Oh, my God, honey.

387
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:11,371
Honey, what's the matter?

388
00:43:11,538 --> 00:43:12,956
-Sorry, she's sick.
-It's okay.

389
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,251
She didn't know what she was saying.
Come upstairs. Come on.

390
00:43:25,177 --> 00:43:27,011
What made you say that, Regan?

391
00:43:29,556 --> 00:43:31,391
Do you know, sweetheart?

392
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,189
Mother?

393
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:40,525
What's wrong with me?

394
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:52,870
It's just like the doctor said.
It's nerves, and that's all. Okay?

395
00:43:53,038 --> 00:43:55,873
You just take your pills
and you'll be fine. Really.

396
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,583
Okay?

397
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:24,610
Is it coming out, Willi?

398
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,405
-Yes, I think so.
-Good.

399
00:44:30,242 --> 00:44:32,994
Mother! Mother!

400
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:36,164
Mother! Mother!

401
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:40,251
Mother! Mother!

402
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:43,963
-Oh, my God!
-Make it stop!

403
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:52,472
- I'm gonna fold.
- Big flop.

404
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,517
Another five for the pair.
There's the ten with two and three of clubs.

405
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:59,979
And a six. Pair of threes still best.

406
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:05,735
- I'll talk to you about it tomorrow.
- Yeah!

407
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:10,990
Yeah.

408
00:45:13,452 --> 00:45:16,037
Hey, if you get a chance,
can you take a look at it for me?

409
00:45:17,122 --> 00:45:19,332
Where'd you get the money
for the Chivas Regal...

410
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,750
-...the poor box?
-Ha.

411
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,669
That's an insult. I got a vow of poverty.

412
00:45:26,465 --> 00:45:28,174
Where'd you get it, then?

413
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:29,801
I stole it.

414
00:45:32,137 --> 00:45:33,471
I believe you.

415
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:37,266
College presidents shouldn't drink.
Tends to set a bad example.

416
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:40,311
I figure I saved him from
a big temptation.

417
00:45:42,147 --> 00:45:43,731
Oh, Christ!

418
00:45:43,899 --> 00:45:46,609
I should have been there. I wasn't there.
Should have been.

419
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,277
There was nothing you could do.

420
00:45:48,987 --> 00:45:50,488
Lie down.

421
00:45:50,906 --> 00:45:53,449
Give me the butt. Come on.

422
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:58,788
-Now you think you can sleep?
-Yeah.

423
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:01,916
-Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
-No.

424
00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:05,711
I tell fortunes by reading the creases.
Now, shut up and go to sleep.

425
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:18,724
Good night.

426
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:27,275
Stealing is a sin.

427
00:47:13,989 --> 00:47:15,323
I don't want it!

428
00:47:15,491 --> 00:47:18,075
-Regan, honey, it's to help you.
-I don't want it!

429
00:47:18,243 --> 00:47:20,536
-Hold still, honey.
-I don't want it!

430
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,914
You fucking bastard!

431
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:28,211
Remember also, O Lord,
thy servant, Mary Karras...

432
00:47:30,797 --> 00:47:36,177
...who has gone before us with the sign of
faith and sleeps the sleep of peace.

433
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:41,641
Lord, I am not worthy to receive you.

434
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:45,561
But only say the word
and I shall be healed.

435
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:50,358
May the body of Christ bring me
to everlasting life.

436
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:08,042
Well, it's a symptom...

437
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,798
...of a type of disturbance in
the chemical-electrical activity of the brain.

438
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:17,969
In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe,
up here in the lateral part of the brain.

439
00:48:18,136 --> 00:48:19,345
-Mm-hm.
-It's rare...

440
00:48:19,513 --> 00:48:21,639
...but it does cause bizarre
hallucinations...

441
00:48:21,807 --> 00:48:23,808
...and usually just before a convulsion.

442
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:25,059
A convulsion?

443
00:48:25,227 --> 00:48:28,854
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.

444
00:48:29,022 --> 00:48:32,275
Oh, no, no, that was no spasm.

445
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:33,818
Look, I got on the bed.

446
00:48:33,986 --> 00:48:37,655
The whole bed was thumping
and rising off the floor...

447
00:48:37,823 --> 00:48:40,616
...and shaking, the whole thing,
with me on it.

448
00:48:40,784 --> 00:48:43,828
Mrs. MacNeil, the problem
with your daughter is not her bed.

449
00:48:43,996 --> 00:48:45,830
It's her brain.

450
00:48:52,004 --> 00:48:54,839
So, um, ahem. What causes this?

451
00:48:55,007 --> 00:48:57,174
Lesion. Lesion in the temporal lobe.

452
00:48:57,342 --> 00:48:59,302
It's a kind of seizure disorder.

453
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:03,806
Look, Doc, I really don't understand how
her whole personality could change.

454
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:06,684
-In the temporal lobe, it's very common.
-It is?

455
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:10,229
It, uh, can last for days, even weeks.

456
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:13,691
It isn't rare to find destructive...

457
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:15,860
...even criminal behavior.

458
00:49:17,404 --> 00:49:20,323
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Tell me something good.

459
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,744
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion,
in a way, she's fortunate.

460
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:27,496
All we have to do is remove the scar.

461
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:45,931
-Let's move her.
- Regan, can you sit up, scoot over?

462
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,272
A little more.

463
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:55,399
Good.

464
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:02,281
Regan, I'm just gonna move you down
on the table, okay?

465
00:50:02,574 --> 00:50:04,241
Let me do this.

466
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:06,243
It's okay.

467
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:10,706
See? There we go.

468
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:17,421
It's just for a short time.

469
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,102
You're doing fine.

470
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:32,311
Very sticky.

471
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:37,066
Good. Now, Regan, you're gonna feel
something a little bit cold and wet.

472
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:52,039
Okay. Now you're gonna feel
a little stick here. Don't move.

473
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:57,420
Good.

474
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,803
Okay. You're gonna feel
some pressure here. Now, don't move.

475
00:52:03,737 --> 00:52:04,862
Hook up.

476
00:52:37,562 --> 00:52:39,230
There's nothing there.

477
00:52:39,397 --> 00:52:41,857
No vascular displacement at all.

478
00:52:42,025 --> 00:52:44,276
Do you want me to run another series?

479
00:52:44,444 --> 00:52:45,569
I don't think so.

480
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:47,321
I'd like you to see her again.

481
00:52:47,781 --> 00:52:50,741
Excuse me, doctor.
Chris MacNeil is on the phone.

482
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,493
She says it's urgent.

483
00:52:52,661 --> 00:52:55,162
-You got some time?
-Of course.

484
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,127
-Dr. Klein?
-Yes, I'm Dr. Klein.

485
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:03,921
-This is Dr. Taney.
-How do you do?

486
00:53:04,089 --> 00:53:06,590
Things have gotten worse since I phoned.
Come upstairs.

487
00:53:06,758 --> 00:53:09,218
-Is she having spasms again?
-They've gotten violent.

488
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,387
-Did you give her the medication?
-Yes.

489
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:14,098
-What was that?
-Thorazine.

490
00:53:14,266 --> 00:53:16,141
Before that, it was Ritalin.

491
00:53:19,104 --> 00:53:21,105
Chris, doctors.

492
00:53:21,273 --> 00:53:23,357
-This is Dr. Taney.
- Mother, please!

493
00:53:23,525 --> 00:53:25,276
What is it?
-Please, make it stop!

494
00:53:25,443 --> 00:53:27,736
It's burning! It's burning!

495
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:30,030
Do something, doctor. Please, help her.

496
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:35,452
Please, Mother, make it stop!
He's trying to kill me!

497
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,122
Mother! Mother!

498
00:53:42,627 --> 00:53:44,795
All right, Regan,
let's see what the trouble--

499
00:53:44,963 --> 00:53:45,963
Regan!

500
00:53:46,131 --> 00:53:48,382
Keep away! The sow is mine!

501
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:53,387
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

502
00:54:02,981 --> 00:54:05,983
Stay away from me! Stay away!

503
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,612
Hold her steady. Hold her tight!

504
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,488
Don't let them!

505
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,181
She's heavily sedated.

506
00:54:37,891 --> 00:54:40,351
She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

507
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:45,814
What was going on in there?
How could she fly off the bed like that?

508
00:54:46,608 --> 00:54:51,737
Pathological states can induce
abnormal strength...

509
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:54,573
...accelerated motor performance.

510
00:54:55,075 --> 00:54:57,034
For example...

511
00:54:57,285 --> 00:55:01,372
...say a 90-pound woman sees her child
pinned under the wheel of a truck...

512
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,167
...runs out and lifts the wheels
a half a foot up off the ground.

513
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,795
You've heard the story. Same thing here.

514
00:55:09,422 --> 00:55:11,548
Same principle, I mean.

515
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:16,011
So, what's wrong with her?

516
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:19,390
We still think that the temporal lobe--

517
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:22,601
Oh, what are you talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

518
00:55:22,769 --> 00:55:24,812
Did you see her or not?

519
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:27,189
She's acting like she's fucking
out of her mind!

520
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:31,735
Psychotic, like a split personality, or....

521
00:55:33,738 --> 00:55:35,656
Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

522
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,450
There haven't been more than
100 authentic cases...

523
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:42,204
...of so-called "split personality,"
Mrs. MacNeil.

524
00:55:43,123 --> 00:55:47,751
Now, I know the temptation is
to leap to psychiatry...

525
00:55:47,919 --> 00:55:52,589
...but any reasonable psychiatrist would
exhaust the somatic possibilities first.

526
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,511
So, what's next?

527
00:55:57,929 --> 00:56:02,099
A pneumoencephalogram,
I would think, to pin down that lesion.

528
00:56:02,267 --> 00:56:04,184
It will involve another spinal.

529
00:56:04,352 --> 00:56:05,686
Oh, Christ!

530
00:56:05,854 --> 00:56:09,314
Well, what we missed in the EEG
and the arteriograms...

531
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:12,067
...could conceivably turn up there.

532
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:17,072
At least it would eliminate certain
other possibilities.

533
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:33,130
Dr. Taney says the x-rays are negative.

534
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:36,300
In other words, normal.

535
00:56:43,516 --> 00:56:45,059
You keep any drugs in your house?

536
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:48,645
No, of course not. Nothing like that.

537
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:50,064
Are you sure?

538
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:52,483
Well, of course, I'm sure.

539
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,151
I'd tell you.

540
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,403
Christ, I don't even smoke grass.

541
00:57:01,743 --> 00:57:03,827
Are you planning to be home soon?

542
00:57:03,995 --> 00:57:06,080
I mean, uh, to L.A., I mean.

543
00:57:06,498 --> 00:57:08,290
Um....

544
00:57:09,167 --> 00:57:10,667
No, I, uh--

545
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,296
I'm building a new house.

546
00:57:15,006 --> 00:57:17,091
My old one has been sold.

547
00:57:18,259 --> 00:57:20,010
I don't know.

548
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,306
I was gonna take....

549
00:57:26,851 --> 00:57:31,480
I was gonna take Regan to Europe
for a while after she finished school.

550
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:35,359
Why do you ask?

551
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:42,074
I think it's time we started looking
for a psychiatrist.

552
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:12,688
Hello?

553
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,704
Sharon?

554
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,450
Shit.

555
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:19,796
God.

556
00:59:27,222 --> 00:59:28,722
Sharon!

557
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:34,144
What do you mean,
leaving Regan by herself?

558
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,231
Her window's wide open.
The room is freezing.

559
00:59:37,398 --> 00:59:39,024
-Didn't he tell you?
-Who?

560
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:41,193
-Burke is--
-What's Burke got to do with it?

561
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:43,779
Nobody was here.
When I went to get the Thorazine...

562
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,323
-...I had him stay with her, and....
-Oh.

563
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:49,159
-I should have known better. Sorry.
-I guess you should have.

564
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:50,661
How were the tests?

565
00:59:50,828 --> 00:59:53,163
We have to start looking for a shrink.

566
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:54,957
Hi, Chuck. Come on in.

567
00:59:56,251 --> 00:59:57,501
I suppose you heard.

568
00:59:58,002 --> 00:59:59,336
Heard what?

569
01:00:01,923 --> 01:00:03,340
You haven't heard.

570
01:00:05,593 --> 01:00:06,635
Burke's dead.

571
01:00:10,223 --> 01:00:13,600
He must have been drunk. He fell from
the top of the steps right outside.

572
01:00:13,768 --> 01:00:16,353
By the time he hit M Street,
he broke his neck.

573
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:19,022
Oh, God.

574
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:21,775
No!

575
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:29,408
Yeah, I know.

576
01:00:44,966 --> 01:00:47,551
Sharon--

577
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:48,885
Oh, my God.

578
01:00:52,473 --> 01:00:54,683
Oh, my God.

579
01:01:02,817 --> 01:01:06,069
When I touch
your forehead, open your eyes.

580
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,162
Are you comfortable, Regan?

581
01:01:17,915 --> 01:01:19,124
Yes.

582
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:22,252
How old are you?

583
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:23,795
Twelve.

584
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:27,966
Is there someone inside you?

585
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,052
Sometimes.

586
01:01:31,596 --> 01:01:32,846
Who is it?

587
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,265
I don't know.

588
01:01:36,142 --> 01:01:38,185
Is it Captain Howdy?

589
01:01:38,353 --> 01:01:39,686
I don't know.

590
01:01:40,271 --> 01:01:43,857
If I ask him to tell me,
will you let him answer?

591
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:46,318
No.

592
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:48,278
Why not?

593
01:01:48,863 --> 01:01:50,822
I'm afraid.

594
01:01:51,115 --> 01:01:53,575
If he talks to me, I think he'll leave you.

595
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,577
Do you want him to leave you?

596
01:01:56,329 --> 01:01:57,412
Yes.

597
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,716
I'm speaking to the person
inside of Regan now.

598
01:02:09,884 --> 01:02:15,097
If you are there, you, too, are hypnotized
and must answer all my questions.

599
01:02:16,724 --> 01:02:18,308
Come forward...

600
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:22,437
...and answer me now.

601
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:34,408
Are you the person inside of Regan?

602
01:02:38,663 --> 01:02:40,122
Who are you?

603
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,216
-Help me!
- Let go!

604
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,723
Father Karras?

605
01:03:42,935 --> 01:03:44,478
Have we met?

606
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:49,399
No, we haven't met,
but they said I could tell.

607
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:52,068
That you look like a boxer.

608
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:55,489
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.

609
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:57,657
What's this all about?

610
01:03:57,825 --> 01:04:01,036
It's true. You do look like a boxer.

611
01:04:01,287 --> 01:04:04,331
Like John Garfield in Body and Soul.

612
01:04:04,499 --> 01:04:07,209
Exactly. John Garfield.
People tell you that, Father?

613
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,254
Do people tell you
you look like Paul Newman?

614
01:04:11,422 --> 01:04:12,881
Always.

615
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:22,849
Well, you know this director
who was doing the film here...

616
01:04:23,017 --> 01:04:24,518
...Burke Dennings?

617
01:04:24,685 --> 01:04:26,186
I've seen him.

618
01:04:26,354 --> 01:04:27,854
You've seen him.

619
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:32,234
You're also familiar how last week
he died?

620
01:04:32,401 --> 01:04:34,110
Only what I read in the papers.

621
01:04:34,278 --> 01:04:38,949
Father, what do you know on
the subject of witchcraft?

622
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:42,452
From the witching end, not the hunting.

623
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:44,454
I once did a paper on it.

624
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:45,830
Really?

625
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:48,083
From the psychiatric end.

626
01:04:48,876 --> 01:04:50,752
I know. I read it.

627
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:55,090
All of this desecration in the church...

628
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:58,593
...do you think this has anything to do
with witchcraft?

629
01:04:59,303 --> 01:05:02,305
Maybe. Some rituals used in
the black mass, maybe.

630
01:05:02,473 --> 01:05:06,977
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?

631
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:08,478
In a fall.

632
01:05:11,732 --> 01:05:16,486
Let me tell you how.
And please, Father...

633
01:05:16,988 --> 01:05:18,697
...confidential.

634
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:22,409
Burke Dennings, good Father...

635
01:05:22,577 --> 01:05:25,495
...was found at the bottom of those steps
leading to M Street...

636
01:05:25,663 --> 01:05:28,582
...with his head turned completely
around...

637
01:05:28,749 --> 01:05:30,709
...facing backwards.

638
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,507
Didn't happen in the fall?

639
01:05:38,175 --> 01:05:39,759
It's possible.

640
01:05:41,554 --> 01:05:44,514
-Possible, however--
-Unlikely.

641
01:05:44,682 --> 01:05:46,141
Exactly.

642
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,688
So on the one hand,
we've got a witchcraft kind of murder...

643
01:05:51,856 --> 01:05:57,319
...and on the other hand, a black mass-type
desecration in the church.

644
01:05:57,486 --> 01:06:00,697
You think the killer
and the desecrator are the same?

645
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:03,742
Maybe somebody crazy...

646
01:06:03,909 --> 01:06:06,911
...somebody with a spite against
the Church.

647
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:09,873
Some unconscious rebellion.

648
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,374
A sick priest, is that it?

649
01:06:11,542 --> 01:06:16,212
Look, Father, this is hard for you.
Please, I understand...

650
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,758
...but for priests on the campus here,
you're the psychiatrist.

651
01:06:19,925 --> 01:06:22,344
You'd know who was sick at the time,
who wasn't.

652
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:25,305
I mean, this kind of sickness,
you'd know that.

653
01:06:25,473 --> 01:06:28,350
I don't know anyone who fits
that description.

654
01:06:29,894 --> 01:06:31,394
Ah.

655
01:06:33,064 --> 01:06:35,649
Doctor's ethics.
If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?

656
01:06:35,816 --> 01:06:36,983
No, I probably wouldn't.

657
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:40,528
Not to bother you with trivia,
but a psychiatrist...

658
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:43,531
...in sunny California, no less...

659
01:06:43,699 --> 01:06:48,161
...was put in jail for not telling the police
what he knew about a patient.

660
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:53,124
-Is that a threat?
-No, I mention it only in passing.

661
01:06:54,752 --> 01:06:56,836
Incidentally,
I mention it only in passing...

662
01:06:57,004 --> 01:07:00,090
...I could always tell the judge it was
a matter of confession.

663
01:07:03,928 --> 01:07:06,179
Hey, Father, wait a minute.

664
01:07:06,347 --> 01:07:08,264
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.

665
01:07:08,432 --> 01:07:11,476
Well, I get passes
to the best shows in town.

666
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:15,605
Mrs. K, though, you know,
she gets tired, never likes to go.

667
01:07:15,773 --> 01:07:17,899
-That's too bad.
-Yeah, I hate to go alone.

668
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,568
I love to talk film...

669
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:24,155
...discuss, to critique.

670
01:07:24,323 --> 01:07:29,494
You want to see a film with me?
I got passes to the Crest. It's Othello.

671
01:07:29,662 --> 01:07:31,496
-Who's in it?
-Who's in it?

672
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:35,625
Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona,
and Othello, Groucho Marx. You happy?

673
01:07:35,793 --> 01:07:37,794
-I've seen it.
-Ah.

674
01:07:38,129 --> 01:07:41,840
One last time. You can think
of some priest who fits the bill?

675
01:07:42,007 --> 01:07:46,302
-Come on.
-No, answer the question, Father Paranoia.

676
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:50,140
All right. All right.

677
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:53,643
-You know who I think really did it?
-Who?

678
01:07:53,811 --> 01:07:55,645
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.

679
01:07:56,397 --> 01:07:58,898
I could have you deported,
you know that?

680
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:02,235
I lied.

681
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:05,488
You look like Sal Mineo.

682
01:08:09,827 --> 01:08:13,246
It looks like a type of disorder
that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore...

683
01:08:13,414 --> 01:08:15,498
...except in primitive cultures.

684
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:20,003
We call it, uh,
somnambular-form possession.

685
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:23,339
Quite frankly, we really don't know
much about it at all...

686
01:08:23,507 --> 01:08:27,844
...except that it starts with a conflict
or a guilt...

687
01:08:28,012 --> 01:08:31,806
...and it leads to the patient's delusions
that his body has been invaded...

688
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:35,810
...by some alien intelligence. Um....

689
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,145
A spirit, if you will.

690
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:40,815
Look, I'm telling you again,
and you'd better believe me...

691
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,818
...I am not going to lock her up
in some goddamn asylum.

692
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,654
-Well, it's out of--
-And I don't care what you call it.

693
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:48,531
I'm not putting her away.

694
01:08:48,699 --> 01:08:50,200
Well, I'm sorry.

695
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,202
You're sorry? Jesus Christ!

696
01:08:52,369 --> 01:08:57,081
Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can
tell me with all your bullshit is....

697
01:09:13,933 --> 01:09:18,728
Of course, there is one outside chance
for a cure.

698
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:25,360
But, um, I think of it
as a shock treatment.

699
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,321
As I said, it's a very outside chance--

700
01:09:28,489 --> 01:09:31,157
Would you just name it, for God's sakes?
What is it?

701
01:09:31,325 --> 01:09:33,827
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.

702
01:09:33,994 --> 01:09:36,412
What about your daughter?

703
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,373
No. Why?

704
01:09:38,582 --> 01:09:40,250
Have you ever heard of exorcism?

705
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,421
Well, it's a stylized ritual...

706
01:09:45,589 --> 01:09:52,178
...in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try
to drive out the so-called invading spirit.

707
01:09:52,346 --> 01:09:54,430
It's been pretty much discarded
these days...

708
01:09:54,598 --> 01:09:59,352
...except by the Catholics, who keep it
in the closet as a sort of embarrassment.

709
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,605
But it, uh, has worked, in fact...

710
01:10:02,773 --> 01:10:05,692
...although not for the reasons they think,
of course.

711
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:09,612
It's purely force of suggestion.

712
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:14,576
The, uh-- The victim's belief in possession
is what helped cause it...

713
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:16,369
...so in that same way...

714
01:10:16,537 --> 01:10:19,789
...the belief in the power of exorcism
can make it disappear.

715
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:26,212
You're telling me that I should
take my daughter to a witch doctor.

716
01:10:27,131 --> 01:10:28,590
Is that it?

717
01:12:07,314 --> 01:12:08,940
Karl?

718
01:12:10,234 --> 01:12:12,735
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?

719
01:12:15,447 --> 01:12:17,407
She's going to be well?

720
01:12:18,617 --> 01:12:23,037
Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom,
I want you to tell me. Now, did you?

721
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:25,873
No, not me.

722
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:27,083
I didn't.

723
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:48,604
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?

724
01:12:48,981 --> 01:12:50,398
Of course, I didn't.

725
01:12:51,984 --> 01:12:53,192
I didn't put it.

726
01:12:54,987 --> 01:12:57,405
Excuse me, madam.
-What?

727
01:12:58,449 --> 01:13:00,616
-A man to see you.
- What man?

728
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:09,584
Might your daughter remember, perhaps...

729
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:12,754
...if Mr. Dennings was in her room
that night?

730
01:13:14,214 --> 01:13:16,132
-Why do you ask?
-Mm.

731
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:18,384
Might she remember?

732
01:13:20,554 --> 01:13:23,848
No, she was heavily sedated.

733
01:13:24,349 --> 01:13:25,808
It's serious?

734
01:13:26,643 --> 01:13:28,269
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

735
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:32,190
-May I ask...?
-We still don't know.

736
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:34,734
Watch out for drafts.

737
01:13:34,902 --> 01:13:40,323
A draft in the fall when the house is hot
is a magic carpet for bacteria.

738
01:13:40,491 --> 01:13:42,283
Excuse me, madam. Anything else?

739
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,577
No, Karl, we're fine. Thank you.

740
01:13:45,162 --> 01:13:46,954
It's all right, Karl.

741
01:13:51,168 --> 01:13:52,794
Why are you asking all this?

742
01:13:52,961 --> 01:13:54,337
It's strange.

743
01:13:55,589 --> 01:14:00,009
The deceased comes to visit,
stays only 20 minutes...

744
01:14:00,177 --> 01:14:04,347
...and leaves all alone a very sick girl.

745
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,600
And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil...

746
01:14:07,768 --> 01:14:12,897
...it isn't likely he would fall
from a window.

747
01:14:13,524 --> 01:14:16,442
Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck
what we found.

748
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:19,445
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.

749
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,240
No. My hunch....

750
01:14:22,533 --> 01:14:25,785
My opinion...

751
01:14:25,953 --> 01:14:29,956
point one.

752
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:33,793
point two...

753
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:36,712
...plus the various other things
we mentioned...

754
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:40,842
...would make it very probable...

755
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,803
...probable, not certain...

756
01:14:44,429 --> 01:14:50,226
...that the deceased was killed and
then pushed from your daughter's window.

757
01:14:50,394 --> 01:14:54,981
But nobody was in the room
except your daughter, so how can this be?

758
01:14:58,819 --> 01:15:01,154
It could be one way.

759
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:04,448
If someone came calling
between the time Miss Spencer left...

760
01:15:04,616 --> 01:15:06,784
...and the time you returned.

761
01:15:06,952 --> 01:15:09,453
Judas Priest, just a second.

762
01:15:10,455 --> 01:15:13,541
-The servants? They have visitors?
-Not at all.

763
01:15:13,709 --> 01:15:16,252
You were expecting a package that day,
some delivery?

764
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,628
Not that I know of.

765
01:15:17,796 --> 01:15:20,464
Groceries, cleaning, uh, a package?

766
01:15:20,632 --> 01:15:23,342
I really wouldn't know.
See, Karl takes care of all that.

767
01:15:25,429 --> 01:15:26,721
I see.

768
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,848
Would you like to ask him?

769
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:32,185
No, never mind, it's....

770
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,855
It's very remote.

771
01:15:36,565 --> 01:15:39,108
No, never mind.

772
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,152
Yeah.

773
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,621
Would you like some more coffee?

774
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:53,956
Please.

775
01:16:28,909 --> 01:16:30,326
That's cute.

776
01:16:31,578 --> 01:16:33,829
Your daughter, she's the artist?

777
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,167
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

778
01:16:38,835 --> 01:16:40,670
Incidentally, um...

779
01:16:41,713 --> 01:16:43,506
...you might ask your daughter...

780
01:16:43,674 --> 01:16:47,009
...if she remembers seeing Mr. Dennings
in her room that night.

781
01:16:47,177 --> 01:16:50,513
Look, he wouldn't have any reason
in the world to go up to her room.

782
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:53,766
Oh, I know, I realize...

783
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:57,436
...but if certain British doctors never asked,
"What is this fungus?"...

784
01:16:57,604 --> 01:17:00,815
...we wouldn't today have penicillin.
Correct?

785
01:17:01,066 --> 01:17:04,652
Well, when she's better, I'll ask her.

786
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:07,446
-Yeah, couldn't hurt.
-Okay.

787
01:17:07,614 --> 01:17:10,032
Uh, in the meantime....

788
01:17:11,535 --> 01:17:12,868
That's okay.

789
01:17:13,036 --> 01:17:17,206
-I really hate to ask you this, but--
-What?

790
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:21,544
For my daughter,
could you please give an autograph?

791
01:17:21,712 --> 01:17:24,088
Of course. Uh, where's a pencil?

792
01:17:24,256 --> 01:17:26,090
Right here. Here.

793
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:27,967
Oh.

794
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:29,552
She'd love it.

795
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,722
And what's her name?

796
01:17:35,267 --> 01:17:37,518
I lied. It's for me.

797
01:17:39,313 --> 01:17:43,357
Kinderman.
-Okay.

798
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:46,944
You know that film you made, um, Angel?

799
01:17:47,112 --> 01:17:49,530
-Oh, yeah.
-I saw that six times.

800
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,907
-Really?
-It was beautiful.

801
01:17:52,326 --> 01:17:54,869
Ha, ha. Thank you.

802
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,708
You're a very nice lady.

803
01:18:02,961 --> 01:18:05,296
-Thank you.
-You're a nice man.

804
01:18:06,256 --> 01:18:09,467
Uh, I'll come back
when she's feeling better.

805
01:18:13,263 --> 01:18:15,097
-Bye.
-Bye.

806
01:18:35,952 --> 01:18:37,912
Please, no!

807
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,164
- Do it!
- Please, don't!

808
01:18:40,332 --> 01:18:43,709
You bitch! Do it! Do it!

809
01:18:43,877 --> 01:18:45,461
Please, no!

810
01:18:47,964 --> 01:18:51,050
Yes! Let Jesus fuck you!

811
01:18:51,218 --> 01:18:54,136
Let Jesus fuck you! Let him fuck you!

812
01:18:58,433 --> 01:18:59,475
Aah!

813
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:02,478
Give it! Give it to me! Aah!

814
01:19:03,188 --> 01:19:06,649
-Ugh!
-Lick me! Lick me!

815
01:19:12,155 --> 01:19:13,239
Chris!

816
01:19:14,866 --> 01:19:17,952
Mrs. MacNeil, open the door!

817
01:19:25,252 --> 01:19:26,502
Open the door!

818
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:29,130
Do you know what she did...

819
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,340
...your cunting daughter?

820
01:19:51,361 --> 01:19:52,987
Chris MacNeil?

821
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,363
Please, go away.

822
01:19:54,531 --> 01:19:56,615
I'm Father Karras.

823
01:19:58,535 --> 01:20:00,411
I'm very sorry. Hello.

824
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:02,913
I should have told you
I wouldn't be in uniform.

825
01:20:03,081 --> 01:20:04,665
Yeah, that would have helped.

826
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:07,209
-Have you got a cigarette, Father?
-Sure.

827
01:20:11,214 --> 01:20:12,381
Thanks.

828
01:20:24,561 --> 01:20:25,895
Cold.

829
01:20:26,062 --> 01:20:27,229
Yeah.

830
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:30,566
Uh--

831
01:20:31,735 --> 01:20:34,195
How did a shrink ever get to be a priest?

832
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:37,323
It's the other way around. The Society
sent me through medical school.

833
01:20:37,491 --> 01:20:38,616
Oh.

834
01:20:38,783 --> 01:20:40,117
Where?

835
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:44,538
Harvard, Bellevue, Johns Hopkins.

836
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,082
-Places like that.
-I see.

837
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,921
-You're a friend of Father Dyer's, right?
-Yes, I am.

838
01:20:52,088 --> 01:20:54,465
-Pretty close?
-Pretty close.

839
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:56,509
Did he talk to you about my party?

840
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:58,260
He sure did.

841
01:20:58,803 --> 01:21:00,346
About my daughter?

842
01:21:00,514 --> 01:21:02,306
No, I didn't know you had one.

843
01:21:04,601 --> 01:21:07,144
-He didn't mention her?
-No.

844
01:21:07,312 --> 01:21:08,938
Oh.

845
01:21:09,397 --> 01:21:11,607
Didn't tell you what she did?

846
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:13,651
He didn't mention her.

847
01:21:15,278 --> 01:21:17,696
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed,
then, huh?

848
01:21:17,864 --> 01:21:19,865
That depends.

849
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:22,159
-On what?
-The priest.

850
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:24,411
Sure.

851
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:29,542
I mean, what if a person,
uh, came to you...

852
01:21:29,709 --> 01:21:32,962
...you know, that was a murderer
or criminal of some kind...

853
01:21:33,129 --> 01:21:36,382
...and they wanted some kind of help?

854
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,551
I mean, would you have to turn him in?

855
01:21:38,718 --> 01:21:41,762
Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice,
I'd say no.

856
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,889
-You wouldn't?
-No, I wouldn't.

857
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,517
But I would try to convince him
to turn himself in.

858
01:21:46,685 --> 01:21:48,143
Mm-hm.

859
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:52,606
And, uh, how do you go about
getting an exorcism?

860
01:21:56,861 --> 01:21:58,362
I beg your pardon?

861
01:22:01,825 --> 01:22:07,371
If, um-- If a person's, you know,
possessed by a demon, or something...

862
01:22:07,539 --> 01:22:09,957
...how do they get an exorcism?

863
01:22:10,667 --> 01:22:14,628
I'd have to get them into a time machine
and get them back to the 16th century.

864
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:16,463
I didn't get you.

865
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,841
It just doesn't happen anymore,
Mrs. MacNeil.

866
01:22:19,009 --> 01:22:20,718
Oh, yeah? Since when?

867
01:22:22,012 --> 01:22:25,973
Well, since we learned about mental illness,
paranoia, schizophrenia.

868
01:22:26,141 --> 01:22:28,100
All those things they taught me
at Harvard.

869
01:22:28,268 --> 01:22:30,936
Mrs. MacNeil,
since the day I joined the Jesuits...

870
01:22:31,104 --> 01:22:34,857
...I've never met one priest
who has performed an exorcism. Not one.

871
01:22:36,276 --> 01:22:38,152
Yeah, well...

872
01:22:40,614 --> 01:22:44,408
...it just so happens that somebody
very close to me...

873
01:22:44,868 --> 01:22:46,535
...is probably possessed.

874
01:22:47,537 --> 01:22:49,246
And needs an exorcist.

875
01:22:49,706 --> 01:22:52,541
Father Karras, it's my little girl.

876
01:22:54,085 --> 01:22:56,337
Then that's all the more reason
to forget about exorcism.

877
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:57,755
Why? I don't understand.

878
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:00,633
-To begin with, it could make things worse.
-Oh, how?

879
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,052
Secondly, the Church,
before it approves an exorcism...

880
01:23:03,219 --> 01:23:06,430
...conducts an investigation to see if
it's warranted. That takes time.

881
01:23:06,598 --> 01:23:08,140
-Yeah, but--
-Meanwhile, your daughter--

882
01:23:08,308 --> 01:23:11,018
-You could do it yourself.
-No. I'd need Church approval...

883
01:23:11,186 --> 01:23:14,021
-...and that's rarely given.
-But-- Uh....

884
01:23:16,066 --> 01:23:17,650
-Could you see her?
-Yes, I could.

885
01:23:17,817 --> 01:23:19,401
I could see her as a psychiatrist, but I--

886
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:22,029
Oh, not a psychiatrist. She needs a priest.

887
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:25,866
She's seen every fucking psychiatrist
in the world, and they sent me to you.

888
01:23:26,034 --> 01:23:27,785
Now are you gonna send me
back to them?

889
01:23:27,952 --> 01:23:30,829
-Jesus Christ, won't somebody help me?
-You don't understand--

890
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:34,083
Oh, God, can't you help her?
Just help her!

891
01:24:05,115 --> 01:24:06,865
It wants no straps.

892
01:24:22,507 --> 01:24:23,841
Hello, Regan.

893
01:24:27,429 --> 01:24:30,264
I'm a friend of your mother's.
I'd like to help you.

894
01:24:30,974 --> 01:24:33,350
You might loosen these straps, then.

895
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:36,645
I'm afraid you might hurt yourself,
Regan.

896
01:24:37,355 --> 01:24:39,481
I'm not Regan.

897
01:24:40,316 --> 01:24:41,608
I see.

898
01:24:46,531 --> 01:24:49,450
Well, then, let's introduce ourselves.
I'm Damien Karras.

899
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:51,243
And I'm the devil.

900
01:24:51,411 --> 01:24:53,328
Now, kindly undo these straps.

901
01:24:53,997 --> 01:24:56,582
If you're the devil,
why not make the straps disappear?

902
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,918
That's much too vulgar a display
of power, Karras.

903
01:25:01,379 --> 01:25:02,713
Where's Regan?

904
01:25:03,006 --> 01:25:04,840
In here, with us.

905
01:25:07,051 --> 01:25:09,303
Show me Regan
and I'll loosen one of the straps.

906
01:25:10,221 --> 01:25:13,098
Could you help an old altar boy, Father?

907
01:25:14,058 --> 01:25:16,435
Your mother's in here with us, Karras.

908
01:25:16,603 --> 01:25:18,687
Would you like to leave a message?

909
01:25:18,855 --> 01:25:21,106
I'll see that she gets it.

910
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:28,030
If that's true...

911
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:33,452
...then you must know my mother's
maiden name.

912
01:25:35,038 --> 01:25:36,288
What is it?

913
01:25:44,339 --> 01:25:45,380
What is it?

914
01:26:39,936 --> 01:26:41,436
Thank you.

915
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:48,777
Look, I'm only against the possibility of
doing your daughter more harm than good.

916
01:26:49,195 --> 01:26:52,281
Nothing you could do
could make it any worse.

917
01:26:52,824 --> 01:26:54,491
I can't do it.

918
01:26:55,118 --> 01:26:57,244
I need evidence that the Church
would accept...

919
01:26:57,412 --> 01:26:59,288
-...as signs of possession.
-Like what?

920
01:26:59,455 --> 01:27:01,874
Speaking in a language
she's never known or studied.

921
01:27:02,041 --> 01:27:03,375
What else?

922
01:27:04,627 --> 01:27:07,963
I don't know. I'd have to look it up.

923
01:27:08,131 --> 01:27:10,507
I thought you were supposed
to be an expert.

924
01:27:11,384 --> 01:27:13,302
There are no experts.

925
01:27:14,137 --> 01:27:17,598
You probably know as much about
possession as most priests.

926
01:27:18,182 --> 01:27:20,475
Look, your daughter doesn't say
she's a demon.

927
01:27:20,643 --> 01:27:23,020
She says she's the devil himself.

928
01:27:23,187 --> 01:27:25,314
If you've seen as many psychotics
as I have...

929
01:27:25,481 --> 01:27:29,151
...you'd realize that's the same thing
as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.

930
01:27:30,361 --> 01:27:34,948
You asked me what I think is best
for your daughter.

931
01:27:35,825 --> 01:27:41,580
Six months under observation
in the best hospital you can find.

932
01:27:44,208 --> 01:27:46,293
You show me Regan's double...

933
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:50,547
...same face, same voice, everything...

934
01:27:50,715 --> 01:27:52,758
...and I'd know it wasn't Regan.

935
01:27:53,676 --> 01:27:55,260
I'd know in my gut.

936
01:27:56,679 --> 01:28:00,265
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs
isn't my daughter.

937
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:03,393
I want you to tell me that you know
for a fact...

938
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:06,647
...that there's nothing wrong
with my daughter except in her mind.

939
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:09,858
Tell me you know for a fact
that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.

940
01:28:10,026 --> 01:28:11,985
You tell me that!

941
01:28:23,539 --> 01:28:26,416
Did Regan know a priest was
coming over?

942
01:28:27,877 --> 01:28:31,004
-No.
-Did you know my mother died recently?

943
01:28:31,714 --> 01:28:34,216
-Yes, I did. I'm very sorry.
-No.

944
01:28:34,884 --> 01:28:36,551
Is Regan aware of it?

945
01:28:37,929 --> 01:28:39,221
Not at all.

946
01:28:40,723 --> 01:28:42,057
Why do you ask?

947
01:28:43,893 --> 01:28:45,894
It's not important. Good night.

948
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:14,548
Hello?

949
01:29:16,926 --> 01:29:21,221
- Here, take it and just don't....
- Okay. Um.

950
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:22,848
Hello, Daddy?

951
01:29:23,016 --> 01:29:24,599
This is me.

952
01:29:25,393 --> 01:29:28,520
-What should I say? I don't know.
- Just talk to your daddy.

953
01:29:28,688 --> 01:29:31,023
-Anything you want.
- All right, um....

954
01:29:31,190 --> 01:29:35,902
Tell him what you've been doing
and how you're feeling and like that.

955
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:38,655
Uh....

956
01:29:38,823 --> 01:29:41,283
Well, you see, um--

957
01:29:41,701 --> 01:29:44,786
I mean, I hope you can hear me.
Can you hear me okay?

958
01:29:44,954 --> 01:29:47,122
-Well, uh, let me see.
- He's not gonna answer you.

959
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:49,374
Uh, ha-ha-ha.

960
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:51,877
- Go on. Talk to your daddy, honey.
- Um....

961
01:29:52,045 --> 01:29:54,379
I don't know what to say, though. Um--

962
01:29:54,839 --> 01:29:58,133
Well, let's see. First we-- No.

963
01:29:58,509 --> 01:30:01,636
-Wait. I don't know.
- Come on, Regan.

964
01:30:01,804 --> 01:30:03,805
-Tell him about Washington.
- Okay.

965
01:30:03,973 --> 01:30:06,808
See, we're in Washington now,
Daddy, and....

966
01:30:09,103 --> 01:30:12,689
He broke the bread,
gave it to his disciples and said:

967
01:30:15,485 --> 01:30:18,028
"Take this, all of you, and eat it...

968
01:30:21,866 --> 01:30:23,158
...for this is my body."

969
01:30:29,874 --> 01:30:32,793
When the supper was ended,
he took the cup.

970
01:30:33,252 --> 01:30:36,213
Again he gave you thanks and praise.

971
01:30:36,839 --> 01:30:40,217
He gave the cup to his disciples and said,
"Take this...

972
01:30:40,551 --> 01:30:42,928
...all of you, and drink from it.

973
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,892
This is the cup of my blood.

974
01:30:50,394 --> 01:30:54,481
The blood of the new and everlasting
covenant, the mystery of faith."

975
01:30:55,775 --> 01:30:58,193
What an excellent day for an exorcism.

976
01:31:00,363 --> 01:31:01,571
You'd like that?

977
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:03,657
Intensely.

978
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:06,910
But wouldn't that drive you
out of Regan?

979
01:31:07,078 --> 01:31:09,329
It would bring us together.

980
01:31:10,706 --> 01:31:11,915
You and Regan?

981
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:13,792
You and us.

982
01:31:25,054 --> 01:31:28,974
-Did you do that?
-Uh-huh.

983
01:31:33,896 --> 01:31:35,897
-Do it again.
-In time.

984
01:31:36,065 --> 01:31:37,649
No, now.

985
01:31:37,817 --> 01:31:39,568
In time.

986
01:31:40,611 --> 01:31:43,989
Mirabile dictu, don't you agree?

987
01:31:45,491 --> 01:31:46,741
You speak Latin?

988
01:31:57,712 --> 01:32:00,005
How long are you planning
to stay in Regan?

989
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:03,049
Until she rots and lies stinking
in the earth.

990
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:07,304
What's that?

991
01:32:07,847 --> 01:32:09,514
Holy water.

992
01:32:10,892 --> 01:32:12,434
You keep it away.

993
01:32:15,771 --> 01:32:17,772
It burns!

994
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,442
Oh, it burns!

995
01:32:43,216 --> 01:32:44,549
Who are you?

996
01:32:56,938 --> 01:33:00,106
You know, I'm, like, in seclusion.

997
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:06,279
No, I'm just exhausted from work.

998
01:33:08,616 --> 01:33:10,033
Um....

999
01:33:10,493 --> 01:33:12,827
She's-- She's all right.

1000
01:33:12,995 --> 01:33:14,871
She's just a little....

1001
01:33:17,667 --> 01:33:19,459
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

1002
01:33:22,338 --> 01:33:24,130
Um--

1003
01:33:24,423 --> 01:33:28,677
Okay, I'll talk to you.
I'll call you as soon as it's over, all right?

1004
01:33:30,012 --> 01:33:32,389
No, I just-- I'm really--
I'm going through something...

1005
01:33:32,556 --> 01:33:34,474
...and I just have to, uh....

1006
01:33:35,518 --> 01:33:37,185
No, no. No, no.

1007
01:33:37,436 --> 01:33:39,312
There's nothing.

1008
01:33:40,106 --> 01:33:41,773
Hey, thanks a lot.

1009
01:33:42,525 --> 01:33:44,025
Bye, now.

1010
01:33:58,082 --> 01:34:00,333
-Want a drink?
-Please.

1011
01:34:01,043 --> 01:34:02,377
What do you drink?

1012
01:34:02,545 --> 01:34:04,129
Uh, Scotch.

1013
01:34:05,548 --> 01:34:08,842
-Ice, water.
-Okay.

1014
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:16,683
No ice. I'll get some from the kitchen.

1015
01:34:16,892 --> 01:34:18,393
-No, I'll take it straight.
-It's fine.

1016
01:34:18,561 --> 01:34:19,561
No, please, sit.

1017
01:34:19,729 --> 01:34:21,688
-Really? You sure?
-Yeah, sit.

1018
01:34:33,242 --> 01:34:34,868
Where's her father?

1019
01:34:35,036 --> 01:34:36,244
In Europe.

1020
01:34:36,412 --> 01:34:38,246
-Have you told him what's happening?
-No.

1021
01:34:38,414 --> 01:34:40,707
Well, I think you should.

1022
01:34:48,299 --> 01:34:53,595
I told Regan that was holy water. I sprinkled
it on her and she reacted very violently.

1023
01:34:55,514 --> 01:34:56,765
It's tap water.

1024
01:34:56,932 --> 01:34:58,016
What's the difference?

1025
01:34:58,184 --> 01:35:02,937
Holy water's blessed. And that doesn't
help support a case for possession.

1026
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:16,868
She killed Burke Dennings.

1027
01:35:17,036 --> 01:35:18,244
What?

1028
01:35:21,957 --> 01:35:24,000
She killed Burke Dennings.

1029
01:35:25,628 --> 01:35:28,463
She pushed him out her window.

1030
01:35:42,144 --> 01:35:43,228
Who are you?

1031
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:48,858
It's a language, all right. It's English.

1032
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:51,444
What do you mean?

1033
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:53,822
It's English in reverse. Listen.

1034
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:56,241
Give us time.

1035
01:35:56,409 --> 01:35:58,368
Let her die.

1036
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:03,915
I am no one. I am no one.

1037
01:36:04,083 --> 01:36:05,375
Fear the priest.

1038
01:36:07,378 --> 01:36:09,045
Fear the priest.

1039
01:36:11,757 --> 01:36:13,174
Merrin!

1040
01:36:20,891 --> 01:36:23,017
I am no one.

1041
01:36:25,396 --> 01:36:26,855
Merrin! Fear the priest.

1042
01:36:28,899 --> 01:36:30,692
Merrin!

1043
01:36:31,277 --> 01:36:34,028
Merrin!

1044
01:36:34,613 --> 01:36:35,905
Yeah?

1045
01:36:37,533 --> 01:36:38,908
Yeah?

1046
01:36:40,161 --> 01:36:41,202
I'll be right there.

1047
01:36:59,722 --> 01:37:01,473
I don't want Chris to see this.

1048
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,184
-Well, what's wrong? What is it?
-Shh.

1049
01:38:13,003 --> 01:38:15,338
You're convinced that it's genuine?

1050
01:38:15,881 --> 01:38:17,298
I don't know.

1051
01:38:18,467 --> 01:38:20,760
No, not really, I suppose.

1052
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:23,304
But I have made...

1053
01:38:23,472 --> 01:38:27,850
...a prudent judgment that it meets
the conditions set down in The Ritual.

1054
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:30,520
You would want to do the exorcism
yourself?

1055
01:38:31,814 --> 01:38:33,064
Yes.

1056
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:38,861
Might be best to have a man
with experience.

1057
01:38:39,029 --> 01:38:42,323
Maybe someone who's spent time
in foreign missions.

1058
01:38:42,992 --> 01:38:44,951
I understand, Your Excellency.

1059
01:38:45,411 --> 01:38:46,661
Let's see who's around.

1060
01:38:46,829 --> 01:38:49,998
In the meantime,
I'll call you as soon as I know.

1061
01:38:50,833 --> 01:38:53,126
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1062
01:38:53,502 --> 01:38:55,587
Well, he does know the background.

1063
01:38:55,754 --> 01:38:59,215
I doubt there's any danger in just
having him assist.

1064
01:38:59,383 --> 01:39:02,093
There should be a psychiatrist present,
anyway.

1065
01:39:02,261 --> 01:39:04,053
What about the exorcist?

1066
01:39:04,346 --> 01:39:05,763
Have you any ideas?

1067
01:39:06,807 --> 01:39:08,850
How about Lankester Merrin?

1068
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:10,852
Merrin?

1069
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:12,645
I had a notion he was in Iraq.

1070
01:39:12,813 --> 01:39:15,023
I read he was working on a dig
near Nineveh.

1071
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:16,691
You're right, but he's finished.

1072
01:39:16,859 --> 01:39:20,361
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.

1073
01:39:20,529 --> 01:39:22,196
What's he doing there, teaching?

1074
01:39:22,364 --> 01:39:24,949
He's working on another book.

1075
01:39:25,117 --> 01:39:28,995
Don't you think he's too old, Tom?
How's his health?

1076
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:32,874
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.

1077
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,584
Mm.

1078
01:39:34,752 --> 01:39:38,296
-Besides, he's had experience.
-I didn't know that.

1079
01:39:38,505 --> 01:39:40,715
Ten, 12 years ago, I think, in Africa.

1080
01:39:40,883 --> 01:39:44,802
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.

1081
01:39:49,224 --> 01:39:50,600
Father?

1082
01:40:57,376 --> 01:40:59,460
-You're Mrs. MacNeil?
-Yes.

1083
01:40:59,628 --> 01:41:01,003
I'm Father Merrin.

1084
01:41:01,213 --> 01:41:03,506
-Come in.
-Thank you.

1085
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:05,633
-Is Father Karras here?
-Yes.

1086
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:07,844
-He's here already.
-Father?

1087
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:11,472
-Father Karras.
-It's an honor to meet you, Father.

1088
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:20,064
-Are you very tired?
-No.

1089
01:41:21,316 --> 01:41:24,318
I'd like you to go quickly across
to the Residence, Damien...

1090
01:41:24,486 --> 01:41:26,320
...and gather up a cassock for myself...

1091
01:41:26,488 --> 01:41:30,450
...two surplices, a purple stole,
and some holy water...

1092
01:41:30,617 --> 01:41:32,160
...and, um...

1093
01:41:32,494 --> 01:41:35,455
...your copy of The Roman Ritual.
The large one.

1094
01:41:35,622 --> 01:41:37,331
I believe we should begin.

1095
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:40,251
Do you want to hear the background
of the case first?

1096
01:41:40,419 --> 01:41:41,669
Why?

1097
01:41:42,171 --> 01:41:44,338
This is yours to do with as you please.

1098
01:41:44,506 --> 01:41:48,092
You can choose to escape, if you want,
but you may never be able to return.

1099
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:50,094
Don't let anyone decide for you.

1100
01:42:03,066 --> 01:42:05,693
Hail Mary, full of grace....

1101
01:42:18,582 --> 01:42:20,708
-Excuse me.
-Thank you.

1102
01:42:22,961 --> 01:42:24,545
Thank you very much.

1103
01:42:24,713 --> 01:42:26,130
You're welcome.

1104
01:42:36,433 --> 01:42:38,726
Would you like some brandy in that,
Father?

1105
01:42:40,771 --> 01:42:43,064
Well, the doctors say I shouldn't.

1106
01:42:43,732 --> 01:42:45,233
But thank God...

1107
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,527
...my will is weak.

1108
01:42:56,411 --> 01:43:01,374
Especially important is the warning
to avoid conversations with the demon.

1109
01:43:01,542 --> 01:43:05,920
We may ask what is relevant,
but anything beyond that is dangerous.

1110
01:43:06,088 --> 01:43:08,214
He's a liar. The demon is a liar.

1111
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:10,758
He will lie to confuse us.

1112
01:43:11,885 --> 01:43:15,972
But he will also mix lies with the truth...

1113
01:43:16,598 --> 01:43:17,932
...to attack us.

1114
01:43:19,017 --> 01:43:21,686
The attack is psychological, Damien.

1115
01:43:22,646 --> 01:43:24,105
And powerful.

1116
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:26,440
So don't listen.

1117
01:43:26,608 --> 01:43:29,694
Remember that. Do not listen.

1118
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:33,781
It might be helpful
if I gave you some background...

1119
01:43:33,949 --> 01:43:36,492
...on the different personalities Regan
has manifested.

1120
01:43:36,660 --> 01:43:38,536
So far, I'd say there seem to be three.

1121
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:41,330
-She's convinced that she's--
-There is only one.

1122
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:08,357
What is your daughter's middle name,
Mrs. MacNeil?

1123
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:10,151
Teresa.

1124
01:44:13,196 --> 01:44:15,239
What a lovely name.

1125
01:44:51,234 --> 01:44:53,110
Stick your cock up her ass...

1126
01:44:53,278 --> 01:44:56,030
...you motherfucking
worthless cocksucker.

1127
01:44:56,198 --> 01:44:58,950
-Be silent!
-Aah!

1128
01:45:10,212 --> 01:45:12,713
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1129
01:45:14,132 --> 01:45:15,549
...hallowed be thy name.

1130
01:45:15,717 --> 01:45:17,426
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...

1131
01:45:17,636 --> 01:45:19,679
...on earth as it is in heaven.

1132
01:45:19,846 --> 01:45:22,390
Give us this day our daily bread.

1133
01:45:22,975 --> 01:45:25,518
Forgive us our trespasses...

1134
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:28,396
...as we forgive those who trespass
against us.

1135
01:45:28,563 --> 01:45:30,773
And lead us not into temptation.

1136
01:45:30,941 --> 01:45:32,483
But deliver us from the evil one.

1137
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:36,404
Save me, O God, by thy name.
By thy might, defend my cause.

1138
01:45:38,240 --> 01:45:43,160
Proud men have risen up against me,
and men of violence seek my life...

1139
01:45:43,328 --> 01:45:47,873
...but God is my helper
and the Lord sustains my life.

1140
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:49,709
In every need, he has delivered me.

1141
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:52,545
Glory be to the Father,
to the Son and to the Holy Spirit.

1142
01:45:52,713 --> 01:45:55,756
As it was in the beginning,
is now and shall be, world without end.

1143
01:45:55,924 --> 01:45:59,093
-Save your servant.
-Who places her trust in thee, my God.

1144
01:45:59,261 --> 01:46:02,888
-Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.
-In the face of the enemy....

1145
01:46:04,266 --> 01:46:07,727
-Let the enemy have no power over her.
-Son of Iniquity be powerless to harm her.

1146
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:11,731
Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras.
You faithless slime.

1147
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:12,940
The Lord be with you.

1148
01:46:13,108 --> 01:46:15,109
-And also with you.
-Let us pray.

1149
01:46:15,277 --> 01:46:16,610
Holy Lord, almighty Father...

1150
01:46:17,946 --> 01:46:18,988
...everlasting God...

1151
01:46:19,156 --> 01:46:21,699
...and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ...

1152
01:46:21,867 --> 01:46:25,745
...who, once and for all, consigned
that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell...

1153
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:30,458
...who sent your only begotten son
into the world to crush that roaring lion...

1154
01:46:31,084 --> 01:46:32,960
...hasten to our call for help...

1155
01:46:33,128 --> 01:46:38,007
...and snatch from ruination and
from the clutches of the noonday devil...

1156
01:46:38,175 --> 01:46:42,386
...this human being,
made in your image and likeness.

1157
01:46:42,554 --> 01:46:47,558
Strike terror, Lord, into the beast
now laying waste to your vineyard.

1158
01:46:47,726 --> 01:46:52,521
Let your mighty hand cast him out
of your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil...

1159
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:56,901
...so he may no longer hold captive
this person...

1160
01:46:57,110 --> 01:46:59,653
...whom it pleased you to make
in your image...

1161
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:00,821
Aah!

1162
01:47:00,989 --> 01:47:04,700
...and to redeem through your son,
who lives and reigns with you...

1163
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:09,330
...in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
God, forever and ever.

1164
01:47:09,831 --> 01:47:11,874
-Amen.
-O Lord, hear my prayer.

1165
01:47:14,795 --> 01:47:16,378
Father Karras.

1166
01:47:18,757 --> 01:47:20,508
Father Karras.

1167
01:47:22,302 --> 01:47:25,846
Damien. The response, please, Damien!

1168
01:47:26,681 --> 01:47:29,016
And let my cry come unto thee.

1169
01:47:29,184 --> 01:47:33,229
Almighty Lord, word of God the Father,
Jesus Christ...

1170
01:47:33,396 --> 01:47:35,856
...God and Lord of all creation...

1171
01:47:37,234 --> 01:47:38,943
...who gave to your holy apostles...

1172
01:47:39,111 --> 01:47:42,196
...the power to tramp underfoot
serpents and scorpions.

1173
01:47:42,364 --> 01:47:44,281
Grant me...

1174
01:47:44,449 --> 01:47:46,200
...your unworthy servant...

1175
01:47:46,368 --> 01:47:48,244
-...pardon for all my sins...
-Bastards!

1176
01:47:48,411 --> 01:47:53,040
...and the power to confront
this cruel demon.

1177
01:48:09,724 --> 01:48:14,103
See the cross of the Lord.
Be gone, you hostile power.

1178
01:48:14,312 --> 01:48:17,231
-O Lord, hear my prayer.
-And let my cry come unto thee.

1179
01:48:17,566 --> 01:48:20,401
-The Lord be with you.
-And also with you.

1180
01:48:50,891 --> 01:48:52,266
Father.

1181
01:49:14,206 --> 01:49:17,458
I cast you out, unclean spirit!

1182
01:49:17,626 --> 01:49:20,753
-Shove it up your ass, you faggot!
-In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!

1183
01:49:22,923 --> 01:49:25,090
It is he who commands you!

1184
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:28,719
He who flung you straight from heaven
to the depths of hell!

1185
01:49:28,929 --> 01:49:30,179
-Fuck him!
-Be gone...

1186
01:49:30,347 --> 01:49:33,307
Fuck him, Karras!
-...from this creature of God.

1187
01:49:36,144 --> 01:49:37,353
Be gone!

1188
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,649
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son...

1189
01:49:41,816 --> 01:49:43,651
...and the Holy Spirit.

1190
01:49:43,818 --> 01:49:48,280
By this sign of the Holy Cross,
of our Lord Jesus Christ...

1191
01:49:48,448 --> 01:49:52,534
...who lives and reigns with the Father
and the Holy Spirit.

1192
01:49:54,246 --> 01:49:55,621
Damien!

1193
01:49:56,289 --> 01:49:57,414
Amen.

1194
01:49:57,624 --> 01:50:00,668
God, defender of the human race...

1195
01:50:02,879 --> 01:50:04,171
...look down in pity....

1196
01:50:04,339 --> 01:50:07,341
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!

1197
01:50:07,509 --> 01:50:09,635
-Shut up!
-She'll never forgive you!

1198
01:50:09,803 --> 01:50:11,929
- Shut up!
- Bastard!

1199
01:50:13,515 --> 01:50:15,057
I command you...

1200
01:50:15,475 --> 01:50:18,269
...by the judge of the living
and the dead...

1201
01:50:18,436 --> 01:50:22,022
...to depart from this servant of God.

1202
01:50:24,693 --> 01:50:26,986
It's the power-- Holy water.

1203
01:50:31,783 --> 01:50:35,286
It's the power of Christ that compels you.

1204
01:50:35,745 --> 01:50:38,831
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1205
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:42,209
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1206
01:50:42,377 --> 01:50:45,421
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1207
01:50:45,588 --> 01:50:48,716
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1208
01:50:48,883 --> 01:50:52,219
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1209
01:50:52,387 --> 01:50:55,931
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1210
01:50:56,099 --> 01:50:59,768
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1211
01:51:00,061 --> 01:51:04,064
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1212
01:51:04,232 --> 01:51:07,985
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1213
01:51:08,403 --> 01:51:11,572
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1214
01:51:12,073 --> 01:51:15,659
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1215
01:51:15,827 --> 01:51:19,246
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1216
01:51:19,414 --> 01:51:22,750
-The power of Christ compels you!
-The power of Christ compels you!

1217
01:51:22,917 --> 01:51:26,295
-The power of Christ compels you.
-The power of Christ compels you.

1218
01:51:26,463 --> 01:51:29,798
He brought you low
by his blood-stained cross!

1219
01:51:29,966 --> 01:51:33,594
Do not despise my command,
because you know me to be a sinner.

1220
01:51:37,891 --> 01:51:41,101
It is God himself who commands you.

1221
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:47,566
The majestic Christ who commands you.

1222
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:50,778
God, the Father, commands you.

1223
01:51:54,199 --> 01:51:56,533
God, the Son, commands you.

1224
01:52:00,413 --> 01:52:03,165
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

1225
01:52:03,333 --> 01:52:05,501
The mystery of the cross commands you.

1226
01:52:05,668 --> 01:52:08,504
The blood of the martyrs commands you.

1227
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:32,653
Give way to Christ, you prince of murderers.

1228
01:52:33,947 --> 01:52:37,282
You're guilty before almighty God.

1229
01:52:37,909 --> 01:52:40,411
Guilty before his son.

1230
01:52:40,578 --> 01:52:43,664
Guilty before the whole human race.

1231
01:52:43,998 --> 01:52:46,333
It is the Lord who expels you...

1232
01:52:46,501 --> 01:52:52,089
...he who is coming to judge both the living
and the dead and the world, by fire.

1233
01:53:14,112 --> 01:53:15,696
Are you tired?

1234
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:25,914
Let's rest before we start again.

1235
01:54:01,159 --> 01:54:04,912
Why this girl? It doesn't make sense.

1236
01:54:13,421 --> 01:54:16,548
I think the point is to make us despair.

1237
01:54:19,594 --> 01:54:21,762
To see ourselves as...

1238
01:54:23,264 --> 01:54:25,516
...animal and ugly.

1239
01:54:28,853 --> 01:54:32,856
To reject the possibility that God
could love us.

1240
01:54:40,406 --> 01:54:42,741
Will you excuse me, Damien?

1241
01:55:34,669 --> 01:55:39,006
Why? Why?

1242
01:55:40,675 --> 01:55:44,636
No. No.

1243
01:56:10,371 --> 01:56:13,749
Dimmy, why you do this to me?

1244
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:19,671
Please, Dimmy. I'm afraid.

1245
01:56:21,215 --> 01:56:23,300
You're not my mother.

1246
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:26,470
Dimmy, please!

1247
01:56:39,567 --> 01:56:41,234
What is it?

1248
01:56:46,282 --> 01:56:47,366
Her heart.

1249
01:56:47,909 --> 01:56:49,785
Can you give her something?

1250
01:56:49,952 --> 01:56:51,787
She'll go into a coma.

1251
01:56:55,750 --> 01:56:57,918
You're not my mother!

1252
01:56:58,086 --> 01:56:59,086
Don't listen.

1253
01:56:59,253 --> 01:57:00,879
Why, Dimmy?

1254
01:57:01,839 --> 01:57:03,173
Damien.

1255
01:57:03,341 --> 01:57:04,591
-Dimmy, please.
- Damien.

1256
01:57:09,013 --> 01:57:10,764
Get out.

1257
01:59:04,086 --> 01:59:08,298
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name....

1258
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:25,690
Is it over?

1259
01:59:26,234 --> 01:59:27,818
Mm-mm.

1260
01:59:35,743 --> 01:59:37,536
Is she gonna die?

1261
01:59:42,875 --> 01:59:44,251
No.

1262
02:01:02,163 --> 02:01:04,122
You son of a bitch!

1263
02:01:10,087 --> 02:01:12,005
Take me.

1264
02:01:12,173 --> 02:01:13,465
Come into me.

1265
02:01:13,674 --> 02:01:16,676
Goddamn you, take me!

1266
02:01:17,345 --> 02:01:18,970
Take me!

1267
02:01:32,193 --> 02:01:33,652
No!

1268
02:01:43,245 --> 02:01:44,287
Mother.

1269
02:01:47,291 --> 02:01:49,042
Mother.

1270
02:01:54,507 --> 02:01:57,342
Mother.

1271
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:01,221
Did somebody fall?

1272
02:02:01,389 --> 02:02:02,847
- The steps!
- Help!

1273
02:02:03,015 --> 02:02:04,724
Mother!

1274
02:02:06,602 --> 02:02:07,644
Mother!

1275
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:10,522
Rags?

1276
02:02:31,919 --> 02:02:34,337
Do you want to make your confession?

1277
02:02:40,219 --> 02:02:42,262
Are you sorry for--?

1278
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:47,058
Are you sorry for having offended God
and for all the sins of your past life?

1279
02:03:16,255 --> 02:03:17,672
-Where do you want this?
-What?

1280
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,090
Phonograph.

1281
02:03:19,258 --> 02:03:20,467
Storage.

1282
02:03:29,977 --> 02:03:31,394
That's everything.

1283
02:03:33,481 --> 02:03:35,190
I'm gonna miss you.

1284
02:03:35,357 --> 02:03:36,733
Same here.

1285
02:03:37,276 --> 02:03:38,943
Sure you won't change your mind?

1286
02:03:54,794 --> 02:03:57,337
I found this in her room.

1287
02:04:02,009 --> 02:04:03,843
You better hurry.

1288
02:04:13,604 --> 02:04:15,438
Come on, honey, we have to get going.

1289
02:04:39,505 --> 02:04:41,297
She doesn't remember any of it.

1290
02:04:41,882 --> 02:04:43,550
That's good.

1291
02:04:47,388 --> 02:04:48,972
-All done.
-Okay.

1292
02:04:49,140 --> 02:04:50,682
Honey, this is Father Dyer.

1293
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:53,059
-Hi, Father.
-Hello.

1294
02:04:53,936 --> 02:04:55,019
Ready, missus.

1295
02:04:56,981 --> 02:04:58,398
-Goodbye, Father.
-Goodbye.

1296
02:04:58,566 --> 02:04:59,983
I'll call you.

1297
02:05:20,796 --> 02:05:22,380
Bye.

1298
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:28,469
-Bye, Father.
-I hope I see you again.

1299
02:05:28,637 --> 02:05:30,138
I hope so too.

1300
02:05:30,723 --> 02:05:32,599
Father Dyer?

1301
02:05:37,271 --> 02:05:39,772
I thought you'd like to keep this.

1302
02:05:48,908 --> 02:05:50,491
Why don't you keep it?

1303
02:06:55,057 --> 02:06:56,307
Lieutenant.

1304
02:06:57,351 --> 02:06:58,851
You just missed them.

1305
02:07:02,147 --> 02:07:03,648
How's the girl?

1306
02:07:04,566 --> 02:07:06,192
She seemed fine.

1307
02:07:06,902 --> 02:07:08,611
That's important.

1308
02:07:10,698 --> 02:07:12,240
That's important.

1309
02:07:13,367 --> 02:07:15,493
Well, well...

1310
02:07:15,661 --> 02:07:18,037
...back to business, back to work.

1311
02:07:18,747 --> 02:07:21,416
-Goodbye, Father.
-Goodbye.

1312
02:07:26,130 --> 02:07:27,380
Father Dyer...

1313
02:07:29,550 --> 02:07:31,342
...do you go to films?

1314
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:32,552
Sure.

1315
02:07:32,845 --> 02:07:35,930
Well, I got passes.

1316
02:07:36,098 --> 02:07:38,433
In fact, I got a pass to the Crest
tomorrow night.

1317
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:39,726
Would you like to go?

1318
02:07:39,893 --> 02:07:42,645
-What's playing?
-Wuthering Heights.

1319
02:07:42,813 --> 02:07:44,314
Who's in it?

1320
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:51,195
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role
of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.

1321
02:07:52,700 --> 02:07:54,240
I've seen it.

1322
02:07:58,620 --> 02:08:00,080
Another one.

1323
02:08:00,915 --> 02:08:03,415
-Had your lunch?
-No.
