00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,595
Tina...

3
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:41,226
Tina!

4
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,525
Tina...

5
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,720
You OK, Tina?

6
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,848
Just a dream, Ma.

7
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,350
Some dream, judging from that.

8
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,775
You coming back
to the sack or what?

9
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,527
Hold your horses.

10
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:01,241
Tina, honey, you got
to cut your fingernails...

11
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,702
or you got to stop
that kind of dreaming.

12
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:04,786
One or the other.

13
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,673
One...two...

14
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,927
Freddy's coming for you.

15
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,095
Three...four...

16
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,140
Better lock your door.

17
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,142
Five...six...

18
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,062
Grab your crucifix.

19
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,855
Seven...eight...

20
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,816
Gonna stay up late.

21
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,818
Nine...ten...

22
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,529
Never sleep again...

23
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,696
It was so scary.

24
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,573
When I woke up...

25
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,492
it seemed like he was still
in the room with me.

26
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,701
Sounds like a real bogeyman.

27
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,162
"One...two...
Freddy's coming for you."

28
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:50,290
That's what it reminded me of--
that old jump rope song.

29
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,834
It was
the worst nightmare I ever had.

30
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,252
You wouldn't believe it.

31
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,838
As a matter of fact, I had
a bad dream last night myself.

32
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,674
I had a hard-on this morning
when I woke up, Tina.

33
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,300
Had your name
written all over it.

34
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,177
There's four letters
in my name, Rod.

35
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,722
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?

36
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,475
Hey! Up yours
with a twirling lawnmower.

37
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,519
Rod says the sweetest things.

38
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,854
He's nuts about you.

39
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:13,814
Yeah, nuts. Anyway...

40
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,400
I couldn't go back
to sleep last night.

41
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,360
So, what did you dream?

42
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:19,862
Forget it, Tina.

43
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,030
The point is that everyone has
a bad dream once in a while.

44
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,323
It's no biggie.

45
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,075
Next time you're having one,
just tell yourself...

46
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:26,869
that's all it is
right while you're having it.

47
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,537
Once you do that,
you wake right up.

48
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:30,914
At least, it works for me.

49
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:36,879
Did you have a nightmare, too?

50
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,843
Maybe we're going
to have a big earthquake.

51
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:45,220
They say things get
really weird just before.

52
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,813
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.

53
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,524
When my mom said she was taking
off for two days, I almost died.

54
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,777
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.

55
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,281
I can't believe his mother's
letting him spend the night.

56
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,701
Right, well...she's not exactly.

57
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,580
See, I got this cousin
who lives near the airport.

58
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,956
It's OK for me
to stay with him.

59
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,417
And I got this
sound effects tape from Rod--

60
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,420
Hello, Mom?

61
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,422
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,636
Yeah, noisy as usual.

63
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,554
Glad we don't live here, huh?

64
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,598
Aunt Eunice says hello.

65
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,644
I'll call you in the morning.

66
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,270
Yeah, sure--

67
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,360
Just some kids drag racing
outside, I think, Mom.

68
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,111
Listen, Mom. I gotta go.

69
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,030
I think there's been
an accident out front.

70
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,913
All right, I'll call the police.

71
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,542
I'll call the police!

72
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,044
Just some neighbors having
a fight, I guess.

73
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,212
I'm fine.

74
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,672
I'll call you in the morning.

75
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,014
It worked like a charm.

76
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,432
Smooth.

77
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:13,642
Jesus.

78
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,145
See? I told you
you'd be feeling better.

79
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:23,068
All day long I've been seeing
that guy's weird face...

80
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,404
and hearing those fingernails.

81
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,240
Fingernails?

82
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,075
That's amazing you saying that.

83
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,287
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.

84
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,872
What did you dream?

85
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,876
I dreamed about a guy in
a dirty red and green sweater.

86
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:44,131
What about the fingernails?

87
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,718
He scraped his fingernails
along things.

88
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,137
Actually, they were more like
finger-knives...

89
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,514
something he made himself.

90
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,017
But they made a horrible sound.

91
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,393
It was like...

92
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,815
You dreamed
about the same creep I did.

93
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,152
That's impossible.

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,281
What?

95
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,201
Nothing.

96
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,620
There's something out there,
isn't there?

97
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,288
I didn't hear anything.

98
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,582
I heard something.

99
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,494
I'm going to punch out
your lights, whoever you are.

100
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,708
Kitty, kitty.

101
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,384
Chow, chow, chow?

102
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,517
It's Rod Lane
bringing Lantz down...

103
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,894
just three yards
from the goal line!

104
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:23,647
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild!

105
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,023
What the hell
are you doing here?

106
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:28,068
Came to make up. No big deal.

107
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,111
Your mom home?

108
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,406
Of course. What's that?

109
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,657
Intense, huh?

110
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,247
What's going on here,
an orgy or something?

111
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,207
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.

112
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,877
It's just
a sleep-over date, Rod.

113
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,880
Tina and me.
Glen was just leaving.

114
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,258
Did you see his face?

115
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,305
Your mom ain't home, is she?

116
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,640
Me and Tina
got stuff to discuss.

117
00:10:02,144 --> 00:10:04,104
We got her mother's bed.

118
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,772
You guys got the rest.

119
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,696
I think we should
get out of here.

120
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:15,490
You guys are going
to hang around, right?

121
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,577
Don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.

122
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,829
Please, Nancy?

123
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,420
Glen, not now.

124
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:32,925
We're here for Tina now,
not ourselves.

125
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,097
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare anyway?

126
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,267
Because he was scary,
that's why!

127
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,601
Morality sucks.

128
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,032
I knew there was something
about you I liked.

129
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,993
You feel better now?

130
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,161
Jungle man fix Jane.

131
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,206
No more fights?

132
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,585
No more fights.

133
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,298
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.

134
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,342
When did you have a nightmare?

135
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,765
Guys can have nightmares, too,
you know.

136
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,518
You ain't got a corner
on the market.

137
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:48,453
Who do you think you are?

138
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,498
Whoever you are.

139
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:03,195
Somebody there?

140
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:26,885
Who the hell is that?

141
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,665
Shit.

142
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:08,510
Please, God--

143
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,804
This...

144
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:11,889
is God.

145
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,746
Watch this.

146
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:49,468
Nancy! Open the door!

147
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,149
Rod, help me!

148
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,823
Help me, Rod!

149
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,918
Who did this? I'll kill you!

150
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,003
Who did this?

151
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,463
You scared me!

152
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,607
What have you got?

153
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,026
Her name was Tina Gray.
It was her home.

154
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,777
Father abandoned, 10 years ago.

155
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:31,820
Mother's in Vegas
with a boyfriend.

156
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:32,946
We're trying to reach her now.

157
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:34,615
What's the coroner got?

158
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,159
Something like a razor
was the weapon...

159
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,369
but nothing was found
at the scene.

160
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,747
It looks like
the victim's boyfriend.

161
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,789
Lieutenant, where is she?

162
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,999
I put her in your office.

163
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,501
His name's Rod Lane.

164
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,085
He's a musician type.

165
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,963
He's been arrested for drugs,
brawling.

166
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,840
Terrific. What the hell was she
doing there?

167
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:52,841
She lived there.

168
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,887
I don't mean her.

169
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,139
I mean you.

170
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:02,518
What was she doing there?

171
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,811
Hello to you, too, Donald.

172
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,064
Marge. OK.

173
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,238
How you doing, baby?

174
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,367
I'm OK, Dad.

175
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,410
Look, I don't want to get
into this now.

176
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:21,870
God knows you need time.

177
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,413
But I sure would like to know
what the hell you were doing...

178
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:27,417
shacking up with three kids
in the middle of the night...

179
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,753
especially a lunatic
delinquent like Lane.

180
00:19:29,795 --> 00:19:32,548
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.

181
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,508
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?

182
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:39,429
Apparently,
he was crazy jealous.

183
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:41,723
Nancy said they'd had a fight.

184
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,559
It wasn't that serious.

185
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,270
Maybe you don't think
murder is serious.

186
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,106
How can you say I don't
take her death seriously?

187
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,777
Look, all I meant...

188
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:59,324
was that their fights
weren't that serious.

189
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:07,916
You know Tina dreamed
this was going to happen.

190
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,418
What?

191
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:16,508
She'd had a nightmare that
someone was trying to kill her.

192
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,596
That's why we were there, Mom.

193
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,222
She just didn't want
to sleep alone.

194
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:32,482
Police say the victim,
15-year-old Christina Gray...

195
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:36,236
had quarreled earlier
with her boyfriend Rod Lane.

196
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,989
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.

197
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:40,490
The murder weapon...

198
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,826
a straight razor or similar
sharp object, has not yet--

199
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:50,292
Where do you think you're going?

200
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:51,793
To school.

201
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,129
Honey, you were tossing and
turning all night last night.

202
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:56,340
You have no business
going to school today.

203
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,133
I've got to go to school,
Mother.

204
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,843
Otherwise, I'll sit up there
and go crazy.

205
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,678
Did you sleep?

206
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,891
I'll sleep in study hall.

207
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,977
I'd rather keep busy.

208
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,938
Right home after?

209
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,981
Right home after.

210
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,484
See you.

211
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:57,234
I'm not going to hurt you!

212
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,072
They're going
to kill me for sure.

213
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,116
Nobody's going to kill you.

214
00:22:06,702 --> 00:22:07,744
Did you do it?

215
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,414
I never touched her.

216
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,791
You were screaming like crazy.

217
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,751
There was somebody else there.

218
00:22:14,793 --> 00:22:17,129
The door was locked
from your side!

219
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,464
Don't look at me
like I'm some fucking fruitcake!

220
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,133
I'm warning you!

221
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:24,386
Just move away from her, son.

222
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,556
Real easy, like your ass
depended on it.

223
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:28,974
Hold it!

224
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:31,894
Jesus Christ!

225
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:41,820
Hold it right there!

226
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,572
Watch it!

227
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:44,573
I'm cool!

228
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:45,574
I got him.

229
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:46,575
On the ground! Now!

230
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,993
Come on! Get down!

231
00:22:48,035 --> 00:22:49,828
Lieutenant, look at this!
A switchblade!

232
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,581
I didn't do it!
I didn't kill her, Nancy!

233
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,041
Daddy?

234
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,126
You used me.

235
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:57,961
What the hell were you doing...

236
00:22:58,003 --> 00:22:59,505
going to school today for
anyway?

237
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:07,638
Let go of my arm !

238
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,642
What is seen
is not always what is real.

239
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,269
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating...

240
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:21,485
in nature, perhaps inside human
nature itself, that was rotten.

241
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:24,988
"A canker," as he put it.

242
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,616
Of course,
Hamlet's response to this...

243
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:34,081
and to his mother's lies was to
continually probe and dig.

244
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,959
Just like the gravediggers...

245
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,337
always trying to get
beneath the surface.

246
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,839
The same is true
in a different way...

247
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,881
in Julius Caesar.

248
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,299
John, will you go ahead, please?

249
00:23:53,016 --> 00:23:55,394
"In the most high
and palmy state of Rome...

250
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,314
"A little ere
the mightiest Julius fell.

251
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,816
"The grave stood tenantless...

252
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:03,026
"and the sheeted dead
did squeak and gibber...

253
00:24:03,068 --> 00:24:04,945
"in the Roman streets.

254
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,948
"As stars with trains
of fire and dues of blood...

255
00:24:07,948 --> 00:24:10,325
"disaster's in the sun
and the moist air...

256
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,537
"upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands..."

257
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,134
"Oh, God, I could be
bounded in a nutshell...

258
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:33,182
"and count myself
a king of infinite space...

259
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:38,270
"were it not
that I have bad dreams."

260
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,235
Where's your pass?

261
00:25:26,276 --> 00:25:28,654
Screw your pass.

262
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,117
Hey, Nancy!

263
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,538
No running in the hallway.

264
00:26:58,494 --> 00:26:59,995
Who are you?

265
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:49,503
Gonna get you.

266
00:27:58,554 --> 00:27:59,930
It's only a dream !

267
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,558
Come to Freddy.

268
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:04,226
God damn you!

269
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:16,238
OK! OK! Thompson!

270
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,116
I'll call your mother.

271
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:21,326
Everything is all right now.

272
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:22,786
Come on. Sit down.

273
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:28,584
I'm OK.

274
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:29,585
I'm fine.

275
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:30,919
You sure?

276
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,922
I'll go straight home.

277
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,757
You'll need a hall pass.

278
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,512
Back to work.

279
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:36,401
And then what happened?

280
00:29:36,443 --> 00:29:39,738
I told you.

281
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,574
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...

282
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,034
under the covers with her.

283
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:46,745
How could somebody be under
the covers with you guys...

284
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:48,247
without you knowing about it?

285
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,791
How the fuck do I know?

286
00:29:50,833 --> 00:29:53,794
I don't expect you
to believe me anyway.

287
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:57,089
What did he look like?

288
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:00,968
Did you get a look at him?

289
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:08,183
Then how do you know
that somebody else was there?

290
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,937
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.

291
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,231
And you didn't get a look
at him?

292
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:17,276
I couldn't even see the fucker.

293
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:20,320
You could just see...

294
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,322
cuts happening...

295
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:23,532
all at once.

296
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:28,120
What do you mean all at once?

297
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:34,376
It was as if
there were four razors...

298
00:30:34,418 --> 00:30:37,588
cutting her at the same time...

299
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,298
but invisible ones.

300
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:44,970
You know, I probably
could have saved her...

301
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:46,597
if I'd have moved sooner.

302
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:52,144
But I thought it was
just another nightmare...

303
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,771
Like the one I had
the night before.

304
00:30:57,649 --> 00:31:00,194
There was this guy.

305
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,324
He had knives for fingers.

306
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,253
You think I did it?

307
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,150
One...two...

308
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:43,403
Freddy's coming for you.

309
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,197
Three...four...

310
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:48,867
Better lock your door.

311
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:50,953
Five...six...

312
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:54,790
Grab your crucifix.

313
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:55,791
Seven...eight...

314
00:31:55,833 --> 00:32:02,339
Gonna stay up late.

315
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,424
Nine...ten...

316
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:09,096
Never sleep...again.

317
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:26,822
What, Mother?

318
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,949
Don't fall asleep in there.

319
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,284
You could drown, you know.

320
00:32:30,325 --> 00:32:32,161
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

321
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:33,620
It happens all the time.

322
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,581
I've heated up
some warm milk for you, honey.

323
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:38,083
Warm milk?

324
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,126
Gross.

325
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,201
Help!

326
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:28,967
Hold on, baby!

327
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:30,552
Mom !

328
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:36,725
I'm OK.

329
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:39,728
-You're OK?
-I'm OK.

330
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,397
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.

331
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:45,984
I just slipped getting out
of the tub, Mom.

332
00:33:46,026 --> 00:33:47,402
But I told you...

333
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,738
hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.

334
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,740
I know, but I'm OK, Mother.

335
00:33:51,782 --> 00:33:53,534
I'm sorry for scaring you.

336
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,120
I'll turn down your bed.

337
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,039
I'll get my pajamas on.

338
00:34:21,603 --> 00:34:24,606
...the act of
bodily dismemberment.

339
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,941
I'm sorry.
I saw your light was on.

340
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,568
I thought I'd see how you were.

341
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,237
Sometimes I wish you didn't live
right across the street.

342
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,530
Will you shut up and let me in?

343
00:35:13,572 --> 00:35:16,325
Did you ever stand on a trellis
in your bare feet?

344
00:35:16,366 --> 00:35:19,077
Get inside before
somebody sees you.

345
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,579
I hit my head.

346
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:22,664
Gotta be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.

347
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:28,545
If you don't mind.

348
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:39,765
So, I heard you freaked out
in English class today.

349
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,683
Yeah, I guess I did.

350
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,894
You haven't slept yet, have you?

351
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:45,938
Not really.

352
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:47,940
What did you do to your arm?

353
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,484
I burned it in English class.

354
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,575
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.

355
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:04,957
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?

356
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,542
Slept like a rock.

357
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,293
Do you believe that people...

358
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,462
can dream about
what's going to happen?

359
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:14,967
No.

360
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,635
Do you believe in the bogeyman?

361
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,303
No.

362
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,138
Rod killed Tina,
and you know that.

363
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,393
I've got a crazy favor
to ask you.

364
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:27,145
It's nothing hard or anything.

365
00:36:27,187 --> 00:36:32,359
I'm gonna go and look
for somebody...

366
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:36,822
and I want you to stand...
Like a sort of a guard, OK?

367
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,205
Now, you can't mess up.

368
00:36:45,247 --> 00:36:46,832
A lot might depend on this.

369
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,667
I won't screw up.

370
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:50,419
Turn off the light.

371
00:36:55,549 --> 00:36:57,718
Here's what we're going to do.

372
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:59,219
It's dark in here.

373
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,889
And it's not
what you're thinking.

374
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,276
Are you still watching?

375
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:00,364
Yeah. So?

376
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,490
I'm just checking.

377
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:50,641
Watch out!

378
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,060
Watch out!

379
00:40:22,214 --> 00:40:24,675
Wake up!

380
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:29,221
Are you there?

381
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,889
I'm here.

382
00:41:00,586 --> 00:41:04,173
Nancy, help me, please.

383
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,507
Save me from--

384
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:06,884
Freddy!

385
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:18,562
This is just a dream.

386
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,813
This isn't real.

387
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:21,356
This is just a dream.

388
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:23,192
He isn't real.

389
00:42:13,742 --> 00:42:17,162
Glen, you bastard.

390
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:18,622
What did I do?

391
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:20,999
I just
asked you to do one thing...

392
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:23,168
just stay awake and watch me...

393
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,172
just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...

394
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,549
and what did you do?

395
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,425
You shit.

396
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,844
You fell asleep.

397
00:42:33,345 --> 00:42:34,346
Oh, shit.

398
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,098
Hurry.

399
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,852
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.

400
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:46,400
Are you OK?

401
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:49,403
Yeah. It was just
a little dream, that's all.

402
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,738
I'm going right back to sleep.

403
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,991
Call me if you need anything.

404
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,303
You mind telling me
what's going on?

405
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:16,054
Just come on.

406
00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:21,894
Garcia, I've got to see
Rod Lane again.

407
00:43:21,935 --> 00:43:23,562
You know,
I took the night shift...

408
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:25,522
so I could get
some peace and quiet.

409
00:43:25,564 --> 00:43:26,732
It's urgent!

410
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,334
We have reason to believe
that there might be...

411
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,169
something very strange
going on here.

412
00:43:47,211 --> 00:43:48,795
Got no argument with that.

413
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:50,589
What are you doing here?

414
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,090
There's an unsolved murder...

415
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:53,759
and I don't like
unsolved murders...

416
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,011
especially ones that
my daughter's mixed up in.

417
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:57,429
What are you doing here?

418
00:43:57,471 --> 00:43:59,181
At this hour,
you should be home in bed.

419
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:00,933
I just want to see if he's OK.

420
00:44:00,974 --> 00:44:03,060
Nancy, take my word for it.

421
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,603
The guy's sleeping like a baby.

422
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:05,854
He's not going anywhere.

423
00:44:14,029 --> 00:44:15,989
Just go down and look at him.

424
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:19,743
Please, Daddy.

425
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,996
All right.

426
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:25,332
Garcia, give me the keys.

427
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:26,875
Right.

428
00:44:28,001 --> 00:44:30,337
Where the hell
did I put the keys?

429
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:50,691
Help! Help!

430
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:01,368
Jesus!

431
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,085
Cut him down.

432
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:13,088
Grab his legs.

433
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:14,923
I got him.

434
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:22,264
Grab his back, would you?

435
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:23,515
Lower him.

436
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,291
Ashes to ashes...

437
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,751
Dust to dust.

438
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,295
May God be
with this young man's soul.

439
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:58,258
His life and his death...

440
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,512
attest to
the scriptures' warning...

441
00:46:01,553 --> 00:46:05,057
that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.

442
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,519
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...

443
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:14,650
that we judge not,
lest we be judged.

444
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:17,653
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.

445
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:24,868
Time to go, honey.

446
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:32,960
Hop in.

447
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,257
The killer's still loose,
you know?

448
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:41,760
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina?

449
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:42,845
Who?

450
00:46:42,886 --> 00:46:46,306
I don't know who he is...

451
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:50,519
but he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...

452
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:55,232
and a red and green sweater,
really dirty...

453
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:59,153
and he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.

454
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,200
You better keep her home
for a few days...

455
00:47:05,242 --> 00:47:06,785
until she really gets
over the shock of this.

456
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:08,287
I've got something better.

457
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,789
I'm going to get her some help.

458
00:47:35,647 --> 00:47:38,025
I don't see why you couldn't
just give me a pill...

459
00:47:38,066 --> 00:47:39,318
to keep me from dreaming.

460
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,403
Everyone's got to dream,
young lady.

461
00:47:41,445 --> 00:47:45,073
If you don't dream, you go.

462
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,241
All set.

463
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:51,622
Please, Nancy, trust us.

464
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:54,791
It's not you I don't trust.
It's just...

465
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:05,802
Let's do it.

466
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:12,392
Thank you, nurse.

467
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:31,662
How long has this been going on?

468
00:48:31,703 --> 00:48:33,997
Since the murders.

469
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,083
She was fine before that.

470
00:48:36,124 --> 00:48:38,627
Now she thinks
her dreams are real.

471
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:42,339
There's no sign
of pathology in her EEG.

472
00:48:42,381 --> 00:48:45,008
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...

473
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,344
who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.

474
00:48:56,562 --> 00:48:59,064
She's asleep now.

475
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:01,191
Thank God.

476
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:07,364
What the hell are dreams anyway?

477
00:49:07,406 --> 00:49:08,574
Mysteries.

478
00:49:08,615 --> 00:49:10,951
Incredible body hocus-pocus.

479
00:49:10,993 --> 00:49:13,787
The truth is we still
don't know what they are...

480
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:16,248
or where they come from.

481
00:49:24,173 --> 00:49:27,092
She's going into deep sleep now.

482
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,930
Heart rate is a little high.

483
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:33,974
It's just due to anxiety.

484
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:36,226
Otherwise, she's nicely relaxed.

485
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:38,228
All signs are normal.

486
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:40,772
She could dream at any time now.

487
00:49:44,401 --> 00:49:46,403
Beta waves are slowing.

488
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,077
She's into REMs now.

489
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:55,996
She's definitely dreaming now.

490
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:59,041
It's a good one, too.

491
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,084
Typical dream parameter.

492
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:06,381
A nightmare now would be
plus or minus five or six.

493
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:09,676
She's about three.

494
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,060
Doctor, what's she doing now?

495
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,479
Is she asleep or awake?

496
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,981
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.

497
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:25,150
What's she doing?

498
00:50:25,192 --> 00:50:26,568
I don't know.

499
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:27,986
Is she dreaming?

500
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:38,622
Nancy, it's Mom !

501
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:43,710
What?

502
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,128
Her hair.

503
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,171
Excuse me.

504
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:47,506
This'll help you sleep.

505
00:50:50,717 --> 00:50:51,844
Oh, my God, her arm !

506
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:53,011
Get something.

507
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:55,013
What happened, baby?

508
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,682
What happened?

509
00:51:00,227 --> 00:51:01,728
It's OK.

510
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:07,609
I brought something out
from my dream.

511
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,653
Where did you get that?

512
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:13,699
I grabbed it off his head.

513
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:31,550
She said she grabbed it off
his head in her dream.

514
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:33,135
No, I'm not crazy.

515
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,846
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.

516
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,265
I don't know where
she really found it.

517
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:39,766
I gotta go.

518
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:54,698
You didn't sleep at all
last night, did you?

519
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,951
You know the doctor says
you have to sleep, or--

520
00:51:57,993 --> 00:52:00,120
I'll go even crazier?

521
00:52:00,162 --> 00:52:01,872
I don't think you're crazy.

522
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:04,458
And stop drinking
that damn coffee.

523
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:13,300
So, did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?

524
00:52:13,342 --> 00:52:17,012
I threw that filthy thing away.

525
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:18,555
I don't know
where you really found it...

526
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:19,681
or what you're trying to prove.

527
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:22,100
What I learned
in the dream clinic...

528
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,603
that's what I'm trying
to prove, Mother.

529
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:29,566
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.

530
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:32,402
It's this guy.

531
00:52:32,444 --> 00:52:35,489
He's after us in our dreams.

532
00:52:39,034 --> 00:52:42,079
That's just not reality, Nancy.

533
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,622
It's real, Mama.

534
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:45,165
Feel it.

535
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:46,917
Give me that damn thing.

536
00:52:46,959 --> 00:52:49,002
It even has his name
written in it.

537
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:51,171
Fred Krueger, Mom.

538
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:56,343
Do you know who that is, Mother?

539
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:57,928
Because if you do,
you better tell me...

540
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,513
because he's after me now.

541
00:52:59,555 --> 00:53:03,225
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.

542
00:53:03,225 --> 00:53:05,561
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

543
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,354
Feel better?

544
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:09,731
You call this feeling better?

545
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:15,028
Or maybe I should grab that
bottle and veg out with you.

546
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:18,532
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.

547
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:29,126
Fred Krueger
can't come after you, Nancy.

548
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:30,252
He's dead.

549
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:31,962
Believe me.

550
00:53:32,004 --> 00:53:33,130
I know.

551
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:36,842
You knew about him
all this time...

552
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:40,846
and you've been acting like
it was something I made up?

553
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:43,265
Nancy, you're sick.

554
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:44,683
There's something wrong
with you.

555
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:47,269
You're imagining things.

556
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,896
You'll feel better
when you sleep.

557
00:53:48,937 --> 00:53:51,482
It's just as simple as that.

558
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:52,774
Screw sleep!

559
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:02,409
It's just a nightmare.

560
00:54:02,451 --> 00:54:03,869
That's enough.

561
00:54:13,253 --> 00:54:16,048
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.

562
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:19,051
And if you can't do that,
you sleep.

563
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,220
I used to.

564
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:22,554
Not anymore.

565
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:30,687
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?

566
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:37,236
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

567
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:40,989
So if you have a nightmare,
for instance, like falling.

568
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:42,115
Right.

569
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:46,370
Well, instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...

570
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:50,707
you say, "I'm going
to make up my mind...

571
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:52,334
"that I fall
into a magic world."

572
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:57,047
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.

573
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:59,883
They get all their art
and literature from dreams.

574
00:54:59,925 --> 00:55:00,926
Just wake up and write it down.

575
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,594
Dream skills.

576
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:06,640
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?

577
00:55:06,682 --> 00:55:08,183
They turn their back on it.

578
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:10,102
Take away its energy,
and it disappears.

579
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:13,438
But what happens
if they don't do that?

580
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,568
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.

581
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:18,819
Great.

582
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,951
"Booby Traps & Improvised
Anti-Personnel Devices"?

583
00:55:27,536 --> 00:55:29,413
What are you reading that for?

584
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:32,082
I'm into survival.

585
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,335
See ya.

586
00:55:35,377 --> 00:55:37,754
You're starting to scare me.

587
00:55:48,348 --> 00:55:50,184
Oh, gross.

588
00:56:19,463 --> 00:56:21,632
Mother!

589
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:28,222
What's with the bars?

590
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:31,266
Security.

591
00:56:32,893 --> 00:56:35,020
Security from what?

592
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,814
Not from what, from whom.

593
00:56:40,192 --> 00:56:42,069
Come down to the cellar with me,
and I'll tell you.

594
00:57:03,465 --> 00:57:06,593
You want to know
who Fred Krueger was?

595
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:09,346
He was
a filthy child murderer...

596
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:12,474
who killed at least 20 kids
in the neighborhood.

597
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:13,976
Kids we all knew.

598
00:57:15,769 --> 00:57:17,896
Oh, Mom.

599
00:57:17,938 --> 00:57:21,441
It drove us crazy when we
didn't know who it was...

600
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:25,195
but it was even worse
after they caught him.

601
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:34,913
Did they put him away?

602
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:38,083
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...

603
00:57:38,125 --> 00:57:40,419
but somebody forgot
to sign the search warrant...

604
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,545
in the right place...

605
00:57:41,587 --> 00:57:43,255
and Krueger was free
just like that.

606
00:57:43,297 --> 00:57:46,216
What did you do, Mother?

607
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:49,928
A bunch of us parents
tracked him down...

608
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:52,014
after they let him out.

609
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:54,975
We found him in
an old abandoned boiler room...

610
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:58,270
where he used to take his kids.

611
00:57:58,312 --> 00:58:00,272
Go on.

612
00:58:00,314 --> 00:58:03,442
We took gasoline...

613
00:58:04,943 --> 00:58:07,529
We poured it
all around the place...

614
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:10,991
and made a trail of it
out the door...

615
00:58:11,033 --> 00:58:14,119
then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.

616
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:24,213
But he can't get you now.

617
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:27,674
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.

618
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:33,013
I even took his knives.

619
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:43,732
So it's OK now.

620
00:58:46,944 --> 00:58:49,655
You can sleep.

621
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,211
Oh, hi, how you doing?

622
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:05,254
Fine.

623
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:07,005
Stand by your window
so I can see you.

624
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,757
You sound a million miles away.

625
00:59:13,095 --> 00:59:15,305
That's much better.

626
00:59:15,347 --> 00:59:18,725
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.

627
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,894
You look like the Prisoner
of Zenda or something.

628
00:59:20,936 --> 00:59:22,437
How long's it been
since you slept?

629
00:59:22,479 --> 00:59:24,481
It's coming up
on the seventh day.

630
00:59:24,523 --> 00:59:26,483
It's OK. I checked Guinness.

631
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:27,734
The record's 11.

632
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:31,488
Listen, Glen, I know who he is.

633
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:32,698
Who?

634
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:33,699
The killer.

635
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,325
-You do?
-Yes.

636
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:38,787
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.

637
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,789
Why would anybody
want to kill me?

638
00:59:40,831 --> 00:59:41,832
Don't ask.

639
00:59:41,874 --> 00:59:44,459
Just give me some help
nailing the guy...

640
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,836
when I bring him out.

641
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:47,296
Bring him out of what?

642
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:48,922
My dream.

643
00:59:48,964 --> 00:59:51,550
How do you plan to do that?

644
00:59:51,592 --> 00:59:53,093
Just like I did the hat.

645
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:55,637
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.

646
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:58,056
Wait a minute.

647
00:59:58,098 --> 00:59:59,766
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.

648
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:02,019
If I can't,
then you can all relax...

649
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:04,229
because it's just a case
of me being nuts.

650
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,190
I can save you the trouble.

651
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:07,941
You're nutty as a fruitcake.

652
01:00:07,983 --> 01:00:09,109
I love you anyway.

653
01:00:09,151 --> 01:00:10,944
Good.

654
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:13,155
Then you won't mind
cold-cocking this guy...

655
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,490
when I bring him out.

656
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:15,491
What?

657
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:16,742
You heard me.

658
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,452
I grab the guy in my dream.

659
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:20,496
You see me struggling,
so you wake me up.

660
01:00:20,537 --> 01:00:23,749
We both come out, you whack
the fucker, and we got him.

661
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:25,542
Are you crazy?
Hit him with what?

662
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:26,835
You're the jock.

663
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,004
You have a baseball bat
or something.

664
01:00:29,046 --> 01:00:33,217
Just meet me at my porch
at midnight.

665
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:34,801
Oh, and meanwhile...

666
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:36,261
Meanwhile?

667
01:00:36,303 --> 01:00:41,725
Whatever you do,
don't fall asleep.

668
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,939
Midnight?

669
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:58,075
Oh, man.

670
01:00:58,116 --> 01:00:59,910
Midnight.

671
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,620
Baseball bats and bogeymen.

672
01:01:03,372 --> 01:01:04,623
Beautiful.

673
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:34,236
Honey?

674
01:01:47,082 --> 01:01:48,792
How can you listen
to television...

675
01:01:48,834 --> 01:01:50,919
and hear your records
at the same time?

676
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:53,046
Oh, I wasn't listening
to the tube, Ma.

677
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:54,882
Just watching.

678
01:01:54,923 --> 01:01:57,342
Miss Nude America
is going to be on tonight.

679
01:01:57,384 --> 01:02:00,012
How can you hear
what she's going to say?

680
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:01,805
Who cares what she says?

681
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:04,558
Don't be such a smart guy.

682
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,351
I want you to go to bed.

683
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:08,812
It's almost midnight.

684
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,898
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with...

685
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,191
these last few days.

686
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:13,233
I will, Mom.

687
01:02:13,275 --> 01:02:14,318
You guys turning in?

688
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:15,986
Pretty soon.

689
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:17,571
Now get to bed.

690
01:02:28,373 --> 01:02:30,125
It's over now, baby.

691
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:32,336
The nightmare's over.

692
01:02:32,377 --> 01:02:33,504
Please.

693
01:03:54,626 --> 01:03:56,587
You shouldn't stare.

694
01:03:58,046 --> 01:04:00,048
You know what I think?

695
01:04:00,090 --> 01:04:03,594
I think that kid
is some kind of lunatic.

696
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:08,015
You shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.

697
01:04:08,015 --> 01:04:09,808
You mean those bars?

698
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:14,980
Marge is just being cautious
with her being all alone...

699
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:19,151
and Nancy
acting so nervous lately.

700
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:21,278
I don't care what you say.

701
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,490
I don't want that kid hanging
around with our son anymore.

702
01:05:14,456 --> 01:05:16,917
Glen, answer the phone.

703
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:25,384
Just a minute.

704
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,554
It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.

705
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:30,597
About what?

706
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:32,933
What's this about, Nancy?

707
01:05:34,601 --> 01:05:36,645
Just a minute.

708
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,689
She says it's private.

709
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,692
Very private and very important.

710
01:05:41,733 --> 01:05:42,943
Give me that.

711
01:05:42,985 --> 01:05:45,487
Glen's asleep. You'll have
to talk to him tomorrow.

712
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:47,531
You've just got to be firm
with these kids.

713
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:48,615
Let's go.

714
01:05:48,657 --> 01:05:50,284
As a matter of fact...

715
01:06:00,836 --> 01:06:02,212
Damn.

716
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:10,095
Don't fall asleep.

717
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:36,205
Oh, brilliant.

718
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:40,542
What if Glen tries to call?

719
01:07:15,869 --> 01:07:18,038
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.

720
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:32,177
My boyfriend.

721
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:40,602
Mom !

722
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:44,273
Locked, locked, locked, locked.

723
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,150
I locked it all up.

724
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,152
I had to.

725
01:07:48,152 --> 01:07:50,654
Nancy, you are going
to get some sleep tonight...

726
01:07:50,654 --> 01:07:52,072
if it kills me.

727
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:55,159
Give me the key, Mother.

728
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:59,204
I can't. I don't
even have it on me. See?

729
01:07:59,246 --> 01:08:00,497
Damn it!

730
01:08:08,755 --> 01:08:11,175
It is now 12 midnight...

731
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:14,636
and this is station KRGR
leaving the air.

732
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,395
Help, Mom !

733
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:08,273
Come on, Frank.
I'll give you a hand.

734
01:09:09,983 --> 01:09:12,444
You won't need
a stretcher up there.

735
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:13,946
You'll need a mop.

736
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:25,916
Don't tell me it's another one.

737
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,085
Lieutenant Thompson,
I'm sorry to wake you...

738
01:09:28,126 --> 01:09:31,046
but I've never seen anything
like this before in my life.

739
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:32,130
And I knew
this is your neighborhood...

740
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,757
so I thought I'd better
call you right away.

741
01:09:33,799 --> 01:09:36,927
The coroner's upstairs now,
but I don't think that he's...

742
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:57,823
Oh, my God.

743
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:03,912
I'll get him right away.

744
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:05,831
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.

745
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,135
Hi, Daddy.

746
01:10:18,218 --> 01:10:20,554
I know what happened.

747
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:24,016
I haven't been upstairs yet.

748
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,393
But you know he's dead, right?

749
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,437
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.

750
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:34,735
Listen, Daddy,
I've got a proposition for you.

751
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:36,862
Listen very carefully, please.

752
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,199
I'm going to go and get
the guy who did it...

753
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:43,285
and I want you to be there
to arrest him...

754
01:10:43,327 --> 01:10:44,620
when I bring him out, OK?

755
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:46,955
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

756
01:10:46,997 --> 01:10:50,000
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy...

757
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:52,127
and only I can get him.

758
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:54,630
It's my nightmare he comes to.

759
01:10:54,671 --> 01:10:57,841
Just come here
and break the door down...

760
01:10:57,883 --> 01:11:00,385
in exactly 20 minutes.

761
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:01,595
Can you do that?

762
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:03,263
Yeah, sure.

763
01:11:03,305 --> 01:11:06,809
That'll be exactly
half past midnight.

764
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:12,856
Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.

765
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:14,566
Honey, you just do that.

766
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:15,609
Get yourself some sleep.

767
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:17,110
That's what I've been
telling you all along.

768
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:18,654
But you'll be here to catch him?

769
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:20,781
Lieutenant, they're waiting
for you upstairs.

770
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:22,658
Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.

771
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:24,701
You just get yourself
some rest...please?

772
01:11:24,743 --> 01:11:25,953
Deal?

773
01:11:28,247 --> 01:11:29,581
I love you, sweetheart.

774
01:11:32,501 --> 01:11:36,797
Go outside
and watch my daughter's house.

775
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,674
If you see anything funny,
call me.

776
01:11:38,715 --> 01:11:40,133
Anything funny, like what?

777
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,426
I don't know.

778
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:44,596
One thing for sure, I don't
want her coming over here.

779
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:47,599
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.

780
01:13:05,552 --> 01:13:08,597
What the hell did that,
Lieutenant?

781
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:10,015
I don't know.

782
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:12,142
What has the coroner got to say?

783
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:15,270
He's in the john puking
since he saw it.

784
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:23,403
I guess I should have
told you about him then.

785
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:25,405
Just get some sleep, Mom.

786
01:13:25,447 --> 01:13:27,241
It's going to be OK.

787
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:30,202
I was just trying
to protect you.

788
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,955
I didn't see how much
you needed to know.

789
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:37,543
You face things.

790
01:13:37,584 --> 01:13:40,462
That's your nature.

791
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:42,089
That's your gift...

792
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:46,802
but sometime you have to
turn away, too.

793
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,065
I love you.

794
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:06,280
I love you, too, baby.

795
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:22,629
Night.

796
01:14:27,718 --> 01:14:29,178
OK, Krueger.

797
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:33,015
We play on your court.

798
01:14:48,572 --> 01:14:50,824
And now I lay me down to sleep.

799
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:53,160
I pray
the Lord my soul to keep...

800
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:56,246
and if I die before I wake...

801
01:14:56,288 --> 01:14:59,750
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

802
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,255
Countdown mode.

803
01:15:05,297 --> 01:15:07,508
Ten minutes and counting.

804
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,940
What if they meet a monster
in their dreams?

805
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:24,733
They turn their back on it.

806
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:26,777
Take away it's energy,
and it disappears.

807
01:15:26,819 --> 01:15:28,612
What happens if they
don't do that?

808
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:31,031
Then I guess those people don't
wake up to tell what happens.

809
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:04,625
You dreamed about
the same creep I did.

810
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,252
Gonna get you.

811
01:18:11,441 --> 01:18:12,860
I'm here!

812
01:19:59,049 --> 01:20:02,928
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!

813
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,643
Shit.

814
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:14,857
Come on, Krueger!

815
01:20:14,898 --> 01:20:16,984
Follow me!

816
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,701
Damn it!

817
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,370
Where are you?

818
01:20:28,412 --> 01:20:30,581
Where are you, Krueger?

819
01:20:31,957 --> 01:20:35,043
I know you're here.

820
01:20:35,085 --> 01:20:38,297
Final 10 seconds.

821
01:20:38,338 --> 01:20:40,465
Nine, eight, seven, six...

822
01:20:40,507 --> 01:20:41,508
Bitch.

823
01:20:44,428 --> 01:20:45,929
I got you now!

824
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:18,337
I'm crazy after all.

825
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:34,102
Come on, Krueger!

826
01:21:34,144 --> 01:21:35,479
Take it down!

827
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:37,189
Come and get me!

828
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:41,109
Help!

829
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:42,486
I've got him ! Hey, Daddy!

830
01:21:42,486 --> 01:21:44,613
I've got him trapped!

831
01:21:44,655 --> 01:21:46,365
Help! Where are you?

832
01:21:46,406 --> 01:21:48,617
Everything's gonna be all right!

833
01:21:48,659 --> 01:21:50,410
Everything's under control!

834
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:52,996
Get my dad, you asshole!

835
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,216
Come on!

836
01:22:04,258 --> 01:22:05,843
He's in here!

837
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:07,803
Don't let him kill me, too!

838
01:22:22,401 --> 01:22:23,902
Come on, Freddy.

839
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:25,445
Can't you catch me?

840
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:30,701
I'm going to split you in two.

841
01:22:40,169 --> 01:22:42,379
Daddy, help me, please!

842
01:22:42,421 --> 01:22:44,631
Maybe I better go
tell the Lieutenant.

843
01:22:55,225 --> 01:22:57,561
I'll kill you slow.

844
01:23:00,898 --> 01:23:02,483
Where are you?

845
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:39,144
Daddy, I did it!

846
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:40,354
Please hurry!

847
01:23:42,898 --> 01:23:44,900
Where are you?

848
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,072
Parker, I need some help here!

849
01:23:50,113 --> 01:23:51,532
OK, you guys.
Come on, let's go.

850
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,492
Let's go.
Al, Tim, get over here.

851
01:23:57,788 --> 01:23:59,748
Get you out.

852
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:01,416
Open this door!

853
01:24:01,458 --> 01:24:03,502
Watch yourself. I got it.

854
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:05,003
It's Krueger!

855
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,505
Get out of the way.

856
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,971
This way, guys. Come down here.

857
01:24:17,307 --> 01:24:19,184
Oh, my God.

858
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:20,519
Nancy, what the hell
is going on?

859
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:22,771
Parker, get up here!

860
01:24:22,813 --> 01:24:24,106
We got a fire up here, too.

861
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:27,192
We're on our way up.

862
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:32,489
What the hell is going on,
Nancy?

863
01:24:32,531 --> 01:24:34,449
He's after Mother!

864
01:24:47,421 --> 01:24:49,381
Watch out! He's under there!

865
01:25:16,617 --> 01:25:18,535
Now do you believe me?

866
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:22,080
They've got the fires out
downstairs.

867
01:25:22,122 --> 01:25:24,041
Everything OK up here?

868
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:36,386
I'm OK.

869
01:25:38,305 --> 01:25:40,557
You go downstairs.

870
01:25:40,599 --> 01:25:43,101
I'll be there in a minute.

871
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:49,775
Lieutenant,
is everything all right?

872
01:25:49,817 --> 01:25:51,318
I don't know.

873
01:26:23,517 --> 01:26:25,936
I know you're there, Freddy.

874
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:33,652
You think you was
gonna get away from me?

875
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:36,155
I know you too well now,
Freddy.

876
01:26:38,031 --> 01:26:40,951
Now you die.

877
01:26:40,993 --> 01:26:44,204
It's too late, Krueger.

878
01:26:44,246 --> 01:26:47,833
I know the secret now.

879
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:50,043
This is just a dream.

880
01:26:50,085 --> 01:26:52,379
You're not alive.

881
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:57,009
This whole thing
is just a dream.

882
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:01,221
I want
my mother and friends again.

883
01:27:01,263 --> 01:27:03,182
You what?

884
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:08,645
I take back
every bit of energy I gave you.

885
01:27:08,645 --> 01:27:10,439
You're nothing.

886
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,610
You're shit.

887
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:32,920
It's bright.

888
01:27:32,961 --> 01:27:37,508
It's going to burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.

889
01:27:37,549 --> 01:27:39,176
Feeling better?

890
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:41,678
Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

891
01:27:41,678 --> 01:27:42,846
They say you've bottomed out...

892
01:27:42,888 --> 01:27:45,641
when you can't remember
the night before.

893
01:27:45,682 --> 01:27:47,643
You know, baby,
I'm going to stop drinking.

894
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:50,896
I just don't feel like it
anymore.

895
01:27:50,938 --> 01:27:53,190
Did I keep you awake last night?

896
01:27:53,232 --> 01:27:55,984
You look a little bit peaked.

897
01:27:57,945 --> 01:28:00,656
I guess I just slept heavy.

898
01:28:02,533 --> 01:28:04,660
I'll see you.

899
01:28:04,701 --> 01:28:05,869
See you.

900
01:28:10,123 --> 01:28:11,583
Hi, everybody.

901
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:12,918
You believe this fog?

902
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,171
I believe anything is possible.

903
01:28:17,548 --> 01:28:18,924
Looking good, girl.

904
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:22,052
What happened?

905
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,347
What's going on?

906
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:28,016
Hey, I'm not doing this.

Gonna stay up late.
