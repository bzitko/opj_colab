GEE, THANKS, MISTER.

901
01:17:50,215 --> 01:17:51,717

904
01:17:58,724 --> 01:18:00,225
BYE!

905
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:03,228
MOMMY, FRISKY
WAS STUCK IN THE TREE!

906
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:06,231
THIS MAN SWOOPED
OUT OF THE SKY

907
01:18:06,231 --> 01:18:08,734
AND GAVE HIM TO ME!

908
01:18:08,734 --> 01:18:12,237
HAVEN'T I TOLD YOU
TO STOP TELLING LIES?

909
01:18:15,407 --> 01:18:18,410
METROPOLIS AIRPORT,
THIS IS AIR FORCE ONE.

910
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:21,413
COULD WE HAVE
THE LATEST WEATHER REPORT?

911
01:18:21,413 --> 01:18:24,416

WELL, IT DOESN'T
LOOK TOO GOOD.

915
01:18:34,426 --> 01:18:36,928
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

916
01:18:36,928 --> 01:18:39,431
WE LOST POWER
IN NUMBER ONE!

917
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:40,932
WE LOST
THE WHOLE ENGINE!

919
01:18:43,935 --> 01:18:46,938

MAYDAY, METROPOLIS TOWER!

927
01:19:01,953 --> 01:19:04,956

930
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:33,985

DON'T LOOK. JUST FLY.

932
01:19:36,988 --> 01:19:38,990
WE GOT...SOMETHING.

933
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:41,493
I AIN'T SAYIN'
WHAT IT IS.

934
01:19:41,493 --> 01:19:43,495
JUST TRUST ME.

935
01:19:55,451 --> 01:19:57,953
Jor-el:
YOU ENJOYED IT?

936
01:20:00,956 --> 01:20:02,958
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, FATHER.

937
01:20:03,459 --> 01:20:04,960
I'M AFRAID I JUST GOT
CARRIED AWAY.

938
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,463
I ANTICIPATED THIS,
MY SON.

939
01:20:07,963 --> 01:20:09,965
YOU COULDN'T HAVE.

940
01:20:09,965 --> 01:20:12,468
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
IMAGINED...

941
01:20:12,968 --> 01:20:14,970
HOW GOOD IT FELT?

942
01:20:17,473 --> 01:20:20,976
YOU ARE REVEALED
TO THE WORLD.

943
01:20:21,477 --> 01:20:22,478
VERY WELL.

944
01:20:22,478 --> 01:20:23,479
SO BE IT.

945
01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:28,484
BUT YOU STILL MUST KEEP
YOUR SECRET IDENTITY.

946
01:20:28,484 --> 01:20:29,485
WHY?

947
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:31,987
THE REASONS ARE 2--

948
01:20:31,987 --> 01:20:33,989
FIRST, YOU CANNOT
SERVE HUMANITY

949
01:20:33,989 --> 01:20:35,491
28 HOURS A DAY.

950
01:20:36,492 --> 01:20:37,493
24.

951
01:20:37,493 --> 01:20:39,495
OR 24...

952
01:20:39,495 --> 01:20:42,998
AS IT IS IN EARTH NOW.

953
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:45,501
YOUR HELP WILL BE
CALLED FOR ENDLESSLY,

954
01:20:45,501 --> 01:20:47,002
EVEN FOR THOSE TASKS

955
01:20:47,002 --> 01:20:49,505
WHICH HUMAN BEINGS CAN
SOLVE FOR THEMSELVES

956
01:20:49,505 --> 01:20:52,007
BECAUSE THEY'RE HAPPY
TO ABUSE THEIR RESOURCES

957
01:20:52,007 --> 01:20:53,509
IN SUCH A WAY.

958
01:20:53,509 --> 01:20:54,510
AND SECONDLY?

959
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,011
SECOND,

960
01:20:56,512 --> 01:20:59,014
YOUR ENEMIES WILL DISCOVER

961
01:20:59,014 --> 01:21:01,016
THEIR ONLY WAY
TO HURT YOU--

962
01:21:01,517 --> 01:21:03,519
BY HURTING THE PEOPLE
YOU CARE FOR.

963
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,021
THANK YOU, FATHER.

964
01:21:06,021 --> 01:21:07,523
LASTLY...

965
01:21:10,025 --> 01:21:11,026
DO NOT PUNISH YOURSELF

966
01:21:11,026 --> 01:21:13,028
FOR YOUR FEELINGS
OF VANITY.

967
01:21:13,028 --> 01:21:15,030
SIMPLY LEARN
TO CONTROL THEM.

968
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:17,032
THIS IS AN AFFLICTION
COMMON TO ALL,

969
01:21:17,533 --> 01:21:19,034
EVEN ON KRYPTON.

970
01:21:19,535 --> 01:21:21,036
OUR DESTRUCTION
COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED,

971
01:21:21,036 --> 01:21:24,039
BUT FOR THE VANITY
OF SOME WHO CONSIDER US

972
01:21:24,039 --> 01:21:25,541
INDESTRUCTIBLE.

973
01:21:26,041 --> 01:21:28,544
WERE IT NOT
FOR VANITY, WHY...

974
01:21:29,044 --> 01:21:31,046
AT THIS VERY MOMENT...

975
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:38,554
I COULD EMBRACE YOU
IN MY ARMS.

01:48:39,423 --> 01:48:43,427
2 XK 101 ROCKETS WILL
BE LAUNCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY,

1422
01:48:43,427 --> 01:48:47,931
ONE BY THE ARMY
AND ONE BY THE NAVY.

1423
01:48:47,931 --> 01:48:50,434
HI, EVERYBODY.
HAS ANYBODY SEEN LOIS?

1424
01:48:50,434 --> 01:48:53,437
NO, BUT THE CHIEF
WANTS TO SEE YOU.

1425
01:48:53,437 --> 01:48:55,439
YOU'RE BLOCKING
THE SET, CLARK.

1426
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:57,441
OOPS, SORRY, GIL.

1427
01:48:57,441 --> 01:48:59,443
HOW'S JUDY TODAY? OK?

1428
01:48:59,443 --> 01:49:00,444
GOOD.

1429
01:49:00,444 --> 01:49:02,446
EXCUSE ME.
MR. WHITE?

1430
01:49:02,446 --> 01:49:04,948
HAVE YOU SEEN
LOIS ANYWHERE TODAY?

1431
01:49:05,449 --> 01:49:08,452
SHE'S OUT WEST LOOKING INTO
A LAND FRAUD DEAL.

1432
01:49:08,452 --> 01:49:12,456
SENT YOUNG OLSEN WITH HER
ON HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT.

1433
01:49:12,456 --> 01:49:13,957
SOME UNIDENTIFIED CLOWN
IS BUYING

1434
01:49:14,458 --> 01:49:16,960
ACRES OF WORTHLESS DESERT
AT INCREDIBLE PRICES.

1435
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,462
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

1436
01:49:18,962 --> 01:49:20,464
THE WORLD
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

1437
01:49:20,464 --> 01:49:23,467
LOOK AT THIS DISPATCH
FROM ADDIS ABABA.

1438
01:49:23,467 --> 01:49:26,470
PEOPLE BREAK INTO A MUSEUM,
KILL 2 PEOPLE,

1439
01:49:26,470 --> 01:49:28,972
AND TAKE A WORTHLESS
PIECE OF METEORITE.

1440
01:49:28,972 --> 01:49:31,475
HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT?

1441
01:49:31,475 --> 01:49:33,477
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND

1442
01:49:33,477 --> 01:49:35,479
VIOLENCE IN ANY FORM.

1443
01:49:35,479 --> 01:49:39,483
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

1444
01:49:39,483 --> 01:49:43,487
I'VE BEEN IN THIS NEWS GAME
40 YEARS, MAN AND BOY.

1445
01:49:43,487 --> 01:49:47,491
I GOT WHERE I AM WITH GUTS,
COMPASSION, ELBOW GREASE,

1446
01:49:47,491 --> 01:49:50,994
AND SOMETHING YOU'RE
SADLY LACKING IN, SON.

1447
01:49:50,994 --> 01:49:51,995
HUMILITY?

1448
01:49:51,995 --> 01:49:54,998
NO, NOT HUMILITY.
YOU'VE GOT BAGS OF HUMILITY.

1449
01:49:54,998 --> 01:49:57,501
AGGRESSION, CONFIDENCE,
THAT'S THE TICKET.

1450
01:49:58,001 --> 01:50:00,003
TAKE CHARGE!
LET PEOPLE KNOW WHO YOU ARE!

1451
01:50:00,003 --> 01:50:05,509
[HIGH-PITCHED SOUND]

1452
01:50:06,009 --> 01:50:08,011
[WOOF! WOOF!]

1453
01:50:08,011 --> 01:50:10,013
THIS IS LEX LUTHOR.

1454
01:50:10,013 --> 01:50:13,016
YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
WITH LESS THAN 4 LEGS

1455
01:50:13,016 --> 01:50:15,519
THAT CAN HEAR
THIS FREQUENCY, SUPERMAN.

1456
01:50:15,519 --> 01:50:17,521
IN APPROXIMATELY
5 MINUTES,

1457
01:50:17,521 --> 01:50:20,524
A POISON GAS PELLET CONTAINING
PROPANE LITHIUM COMPOUND

1458
01:50:20,524 --> 01:50:25,028
WILL BE RELEASED THROUGH
AIR DUCTS IN THE CITY,

1459
01:50:25,028 --> 01:50:27,531
EFFECTIVELY ANNIHILATING
HALF OF METROPOLIS' POPULATION.

1460
01:50:27,531 --> 01:50:31,034
I WAS A REPORTER BEFORE
MY FRIENDS WERE COPY BOYS.

1461
01:50:31,034 --> 01:50:33,537
HAVE LOIS INTRODUCE YOU
TO SUPERMAN.

1462
01:50:33,537 --> 01:50:36,540
FIND OUT WHO HE IS,
WHAT'S HE LIKE.

1463
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:37,541
WHERE'D HE GET
THAT BLUE SUIT?

1464
01:50:37,541 --> 01:50:39,042
DID HE HAVE IT MADE?

1465
01:50:39,042 --> 01:50:41,545
IS IT SILK?
IS IT PLASTIC?

1466
01:50:41,545 --> 01:50:44,548
Luthor: I KNOW IT ALL SEEMS
A BIT MUCH,

1467
01:50:44,548 --> 01:50:48,051
BUT HOW ELSE
WAS I GOING TO MEET YOU?

1468
01:50:48,051 --> 01:50:51,555
I KNEW YOU'D NEVER ACCEPT
AN INVITATION TO TEA.

1469
01:50:51,555 --> 01:50:54,558
BUT A DISASTER
WITH PEOPLE IN DANGER,

1470
01:50:54,558 --> 01:50:57,060
I JUST KNEW
YOU COULDN'T RESIST

1471
01:50:57,060 --> 01:51:00,063
THE CHANCE
TO SORT OF PITCH IN.

1472
01:51:00,063 --> 01:51:02,065
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1473
01:51:19,583 --> 01:51:21,585
THAT'S SUPERMAN!

1474
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:28,592
OH, LOOK!
IT'S SUPERMAN!

1475
01:51:28,592 --> 01:51:31,595
OH, WOW!
LOOK AT HIM!

1476
01:51:35,098 --> 01:51:37,100
Luthor:
THERE'S A STRONG STREAK

1477
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:39,102
OF GOOD IN YOU, SUPERMAN,

1478
01:51:39,102 --> 01:51:41,605
BUT THEN, NOBODY'S PERFECT.

1479
01:51:44,608 --> 01:51:46,109
ALMOST NOBODY.

1480
01:51:54,418 --> 01:51:55,419
WHAT THE--

1481
01:51:55,419 --> 01:51:57,421
SUPERMAN!
GEE!

1482
01:51:57,421 --> 01:52:00,924
STAND BACK, PLEASE.
NOTHING TO GET WORRIED ABOUT.

1483
01:52:06,430 --> 01:52:08,432
DON'T SIT THERE,
YOU NUMSKULL!

1484
01:52:22,312 --> 01:52:25,315
LOOK AT THAT OVERGROWN
BOY SCOUT.

1485
01:52:25,315 --> 01:52:26,817
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

1486
01:52:27,818 --> 01:52:28,819
CUTENESS,

1487
01:52:28,819 --> 01:52:29,820
DIMPLES.

1488
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:32,823
YOU LIKE CUTENESS, HUH?

1489
01:52:32,823 --> 01:52:34,825
DIMPLES?

1490
01:52:34,825 --> 01:52:37,327
I'LL GIVE YOU DIMPLES.

1491
01:53:10,360 --> 01:53:13,864
THE PRESSURE'S
STILL ON YOU, SUPERMAN.

1492
01:53:13,864 --> 01:53:15,866
YOU WHAT THEY SAY--
IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT,

1493
01:53:15,866 --> 01:53:17,868
GET OUT OF THE TUNNEL.

1494
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:42,893
THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE, SUPERMAN.

1495
01:53:43,393 --> 01:53:47,397
WHY DON'T YOU DO YOURSELF
A FAVOR AND FREEZE?

1496
01:54:05,415 --> 01:54:06,917
GOD.

1497
01:54:27,938 --> 01:54:29,439
GOOD.

1498
01:54:47,791 --> 01:54:49,292
I THINK
HE'S COMING.

1499
01:54:59,803 --> 01:55:02,806
HE'S DEFINITELY
COMING, MR. LUTHOR.

1500
01:55:13,817 --> 01:55:16,820
IT'S OPEN.
COME IN.

1501
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:18,822
MY ATTORNEY
WILL CONTACT YOU

1502
01:55:18,822 --> 01:55:21,324
ABOUT THE DAMAGE
TO THE DOOR.

1503
01:55:21,324 --> 01:55:23,326
OTIS, TAKE
THE GENTLEMAN'S CAPE.

1504
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:30,333
I DON'T THINK HE WANTS
ME TO, MR. LUTHOR.

1505
01:55:30,333 --> 01:55:32,335
WHERE'S THE GAS PELLET?

1506
01:55:32,335 --> 01:55:33,837
SOMEWHERE.

1507
01:55:34,838 --> 01:55:38,341
IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND, ACTUALLY.

1508
01:55:38,341 --> 01:55:40,844
LITTLE IDEA
I WAS TOYING WITH.

1509
01:55:40,844 --> 01:55:42,846
IS THAT HOW A WARPED BRAIN
LIKE YOURS GETS ITS KICKS?

1510
01:55:42,846 --> 01:55:45,348
BY PLANNING THE DEATH
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE?

1511
01:55:45,348 --> 01:55:49,352
NO, BYCAUSINGTHE DEATH
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE.

1512
01:55:49,352 --> 01:55:50,854
FIRE.

1513
01:55:51,855 --> 01:55:54,357
NAVY BIRD...

1514
01:55:54,858 --> 01:55:57,861
WE HAVE A GOOD LAUNCH,
NAVY MISSILE.

1515
01:55:57,861 --> 01:55:59,362
XK 101...XK 101...

1516
01:55:59,863 --> 01:56:01,364
ANGLE OF ATTACK
IS PERFECT.

1517
01:56:01,364 --> 01:56:03,366
CLIMBING FAST.

1518
01:56:03,366 --> 01:56:05,368
HYDRAULICS, PURE FUNCTION.

1519
01:56:05,869 --> 01:56:08,371
AS YOU MAY
OR MAY NOT KNOW,

1520
01:56:08,371 --> 01:56:11,374
I AM VERY HEAVY
INTO REAL ESTATE.

1521
01:56:11,374 --> 01:56:14,377
IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY
IN THAT GAME,

1522
01:56:14,377 --> 01:56:17,380
YOU HAVE TO BUY
FOR A LITTLE

1523
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:19,382
AND SELL FOR A LOT.

1524
01:56:19,382 --> 01:56:20,884
SO, THE PROBLEM--

1525
01:56:20,884 --> 01:56:23,887
HOW TO MAKE THE LAND
MORE VALUABLE

1526
01:56:23,887 --> 01:56:26,389
BETWEEN THE TIME
YOU BUY IT

1527
01:56:26,389 --> 01:56:28,892
AND THE TIME YOU SELL IT.

1528
01:56:28,892 --> 01:56:30,393
THIS IS CALIFORNIA,

1529
01:56:30,393 --> 01:56:32,896
THE RICHEST STATE
IN THE UNION.

1530
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:35,899
I DON'T NEED A GEOGRAPHY
LESSON, LUTHOR.

1531
01:56:35,899 --> 01:56:38,401
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.
YOU GET AROUND.

1532
01:56:38,401 --> 01:56:40,904
WHERE WAS I?

1533
01:56:40,904 --> 01:56:42,405
CALIFORNIA.

1534
01:56:42,906 --> 01:56:44,407
THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT.

1535
01:56:44,407 --> 01:56:45,408
MAYBE YOU'VE
HEARD OF IT?

1536
01:56:45,909 --> 01:56:48,411
THE JOINING TOGETHER
OF 2 LAND MASSES.

1537
01:56:48,411 --> 01:56:50,413
THE FAULT LINE
IS SHIFTING,

1538
01:56:50,413 --> 01:56:52,415
WHICH IS WHY
YOU GET EARTHQUAKES.

1539
01:56:52,415 --> 01:56:53,917
WONDERFUL!

1540
01:56:53,917 --> 01:56:55,919
COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT
BETTER MYSELF.

1541
01:56:56,419 --> 01:56:58,421
EVERYTHING WEST
OF THIS LINE

1542
01:56:58,421 --> 01:57:01,424
IS THE RICHEST REAL ESTATE
IN THE WORLD--

1543
01:57:01,424 --> 01:57:03,927
SAN DIEGO, LOS ANGELES,
SAN FRANCISCO.

1544
01:57:03,927 --> 01:57:05,428
EVERYTHING
ON THIS SIDE

1545
01:57:05,428 --> 01:57:06,429
IS JUST
HUNDREDS OF MILES

1546
01:57:06,429 --> 01:57:08,932
OF WORTHLESS
DESERT LAND

1547
01:57:08,932 --> 01:57:11,434
WHICH HAPPENS
TO BE OWNED BY...

CALL ME IRRESPONSIBLE...

1551
01:57:16,439 --> 01:57:20,443
IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT A 500-MEGATON BOMB

1552
01:57:20,443 --> 01:57:23,446
PLANTED AT JUST
THE PROPER POINT,

01:57:23,947 --> 01:57:25,448
WOULD, UH...

1554
01:57:25,448 --> 01:57:27,450
WOULD DESTROY
MOST OF CALIFORNIA.

1555
01:57:27,450 --> 01:57:29,953
MILLIONS OF INNOCENT
PEOPLE WOULD BE KILLED.

1556
01:57:29,953 --> 01:57:32,956
THE WEST COAST
AS WE KNOW IT WOULD--

1557
01:57:32,956 --> 01:57:34,958
FALL INTO THE SEA.

1558
01:57:34,958 --> 01:57:36,960
BYE-BYE, CALIFORNIA.

1559
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:38,461

1565
01:57:50,974 --> 01:57:52,976
SHE'S GOT
HER OWN PLACE.

1567
01:57:54,477 --> 01:57:56,479
IT'S A LITTLE,
BITTY PLACE.

1568
01:57:56,479 --> 01:57:57,981

1569
01:57:58,481 --> 01:58:00,984
I'LL JUST
WIPE IT OFF.

YOUR PLAN COULDN'T WORK.

1573
01:58:05,989 --> 01:58:07,991
THERE WERE
SOME PROBLEMS--

1574
01:58:07,991 --> 01:58:10,493
ADJUSTING THE TRAJECTORY
OF THE MISSILE,

1575
01:58:10,493 --> 01:58:13,496
FINDING THE OPTIMUM
STRESS POINT

1576
01:58:13,496 --> 01:58:15,498
FOR THE FAULT LINE
ITSELF--

1577
01:58:15,498 --> 01:58:19,002
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
IS TARGET ZERO,

1578
01:58:19,502 --> 01:58:21,004
RIGHT HERE.

1579
01:58:21,004 --> 01:58:22,639
OOH!

01:58:45,662 --> 01:58:47,163
WHAT?

1584
01:58:47,163 --> 01:58:50,166
ARMY BIRDS
HAVE VARIED THEIR COURSE.

1585
01:58:50,667 --> 01:58:52,168
WHAT'S HAPPENING,

1586
01:58:52,168 --> 01:58:53,670

1587
01:58:53,670 --> 01:58:55,171
WE HAVE INITIAL FAILURE.

1588
01:58:55,171 --> 01:58:56,673
THEN ABORT!

1589
01:58:56,673 --> 01:58:58,174
