<i>Pearl Harbor outer marker,
30 minutes.</i>

3
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:20,630
Hey, Case!

4
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,871
What's happening?

5
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,089
Where's your whites?
The Prez is coming.

6
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:25,760
He won't miss me.

7
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:29,760
What's this? You're in the Navy,
you've got to look good.

8
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:32,263
- Cue Ball!
- Where's your whites?

9
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:36,979
- Poor boy doesn't have a dress uniform.
- I've got the dress, I forgot the pumps.

10
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:55,909
Tell him not to worry.
Everything here is handled.

11
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:58,500
Oh, my God.

12
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,709
No, no, that's okay.
We'll take care of it.

13
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,428
Well, it's going to be a zoo.

14
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:08,960
Chief Ryback.

15
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:10,378
Send him in.

16
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,055
Get in your dress uniform.

17
00:02:18,356 --> 00:02:21,357
You know how I feel about ceremonies.
I thought this time...

18
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,809
If I had your ribbons,
I'd wear them to bed.

19
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:25,184
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:28,156
Get in your whites.
I'll introduce you to the President.

21
00:02:28,407 --> 00:02:31,823
- I appreciate that, but...
- That's not a good idea.

22
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:35,322
For once, Commander Krill and I
are in total agreement.

23
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,203
I have 50 gallons of bouillabaisse
I need to prepare by tomorrow.

24
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:43,545
- My birthday?
- I could do the cheeseburger routine.

25
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:48,674
It's not for me, it's the crew.
They really love that stuff.

26
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:52,255
Just don't show your face
till after the ceremony.

27
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,973
You're a sorry-looking sailor.

28
00:02:55,434 --> 00:02:57,926
That I am. Thank you, sir.

29
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:05,391
Sir...

30
00:03:05,778 --> 00:03:08,269
...why do you tolerate that clown?

31
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,198
I know he's a good cook...

32
00:03:10,449 --> 00:03:14,993
He's more than a good cook. You have
no idea. Now let him be, XO.

33
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:16,783
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:24,623
<i>Fifty years ago today...</i>

35
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,089
<i>... the infamous Japanese attack
destroyed the Pacific fleet...</i>

36
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,671
<i>... here in Pearl Harbor.</i>

37
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:33,842
<i>In honor of those who died,
the USS Missouri now returns.</i>

38
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:37,547
<i>Built to avenge Pearl Harbor,
she did.</i>

39
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,266
<i>Days after we dropped the bomb
on Hiroshima...</i>

40
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,231
<i>... Japan surrendered
on the Missouri's deck...</i>

41
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:44,811
<i>... ending World War II.</i>

42
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,685
<i>The Missouri fired the first shots
of the Gulf War.</i>

43
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:53,607
<i>Her powerful 16 inch guns destroyed
Iraqi bunkers.</i>

44
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:57,403
<i>Her Tomahawk missiles rocketed deep
into the heart of Baghdad.</i>

45
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:01,580
<i>The fastest and most powerful
dreadnought ever to sail the seas...</i>

46
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:05,326
Where's your tattoo?

47
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:08,210
Where I got it, you don't want to see.

48
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:12,175
<i>Now the ship will be decommissioned.</i>

49
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,340
<i>President Bush is paying final tribute
to the ship...</i>

50
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,009
<i>... and her great history.</i>

51
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:21,174
Did you hear the joke about Andre
and Beaudreau hunting on the bayou?

52
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:25,604
"Where're the guns, Druillet?"

53
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:27,390
That's about right.

54
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:30,653
In the end this unity
of purpose...

55
00:04:30,905 --> 00:04:34,523
<i>These ceremonies not only remember war,
they celebrate peace.</i>

56
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:38,568
<i>The President ordered the removal
of all Tomahawk cruise missiles...</i>

57
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,288
<i>... from U.S. surface ships.</i>

58
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,489
<i>Tomorrow the ship embarks for
San Francisco for her final voyage.</i>

59
00:04:44,794 --> 00:04:49,670
<i>Her weaponry will be removed,
dismantled, and never fired again.</i>

60
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:54,177
<i>The vessel will then take her place
in naval history.</i>

61
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:58,806
We will gain the inevitable triumph,
so help us God.

62
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:04,891
Look at the money spent
on this photo opportunity.

63
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,889
Ready to go, sir.

64
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:12,275
Very well, let's single up.

65
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,907
Aye, sir.
Single up all lines.

66
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,597
- Captain, you have clear water to port.
- Very well.

67
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:54,315
Krill ain't running this ship.

68
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:57,531
The old man has to okay
all helicopter landings.

69
00:05:57,783 --> 00:06:02,280
How's the captain going to authorize
a surprise party for himself?

70
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:04,661
We already stowed all the gear.

71
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,867
What's on this helicopter?

72
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,786
This little sweetheart.

73
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,167
- She's in the...
- Yeah, she's in the cake.

74
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:17,089
That is Miss July '89. Jordan Tate.

75
00:06:17,345 --> 00:06:21,294
- We'll be ready for her.
- Good. Go ahead and keep that.

76
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:26,895
Lieutenant, we don't have time
to talk about this now.

77
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:31,138
No time for the security
of nuclear weapons?

78
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,435
Maybe I'm not being clear.

79
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,229
Any watches not crucial shall be
secured during the party...

80
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,399
...including the Marine roving patrol.

81
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,948
We're operating
on a skeleton crew.

82
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,366
This is an order.

83
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:47,868
The log will show I consider this
unsafe, and obeyed under protest.

84
00:06:48,125 --> 00:06:49,205
Fine.

85
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,340
Hey, Cue Ball.

86
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,924
Cue Ball in the house.

87
00:06:58,177 --> 00:06:59,422
Show me a move!

88
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,718
Turn up the tunes! Turn up the tunes!

89
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:06,884
Come on, show me some moves.
Come on!

90
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:08,722
Go, Cue Ball!

91
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,305
Go, Cue Ball! Go, Cue Ball, go!

92
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,250
That was cute.

93
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:33,582
Petty Officer Ryback?

94
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:36,329
- Ensign Taylor.
- Sir.

95
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:39,836
You don't have to "sir" me.
We're casual in the galley.

96
00:07:40,094 --> 00:07:42,763
I'd watch it.
We still have a week together.

97
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:45,635
So I won't get to see you
go through puberty.

98
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:49,884
What is it?

99
00:07:50,146 --> 00:07:53,313
I have orders from the XO
on the captain's birthday.

100
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,139
We're having dinner flown in
from Hawaii.

101
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,727
This galley will be cleared by 1700.

102
00:07:58,988 --> 00:08:03,449
You are to report to the mess deck
prior to the helo's arrival.

103
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,732
Negative.

104
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,025
Excuse me?

105
00:08:06,287 --> 00:08:10,201
Only I cook for the captain.
You don't like that, talk to him.

106
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,497
I don't believe you get it.

107
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:16,370
See, this is a surprise party.

108
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:20,379
No one is going to talk
to the captain about this.

109
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:21,666
You know something?

110
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:25,297
He don't like surprises.
Neither do I.

111
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:29,139
Then I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?

112
00:08:38,528 --> 00:08:42,525
"I guess we'll just see
what we'll see. Won't we?"

113
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:45,024
Krill's going to skin you alive.

114
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:48,618
Why is it that I'm
starting to shake so bad...

115
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:50,828
...and there's this deep fear in me...

116
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:55,827
...thinking about Mr. Krill and
the horrible things he'll do to me?

117
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,123
Commander Krill.

118
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,042
Send him in.

119
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:15,271
You wanted to see me, Captain?

120
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,269
Commander Krill...

121
00:09:17,483 --> 00:09:21,232
...how'd you expect to land
a helicopter without my authorization?

122
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:25,615
- It was a mistake to think...
- It was a mistake to try.

123
00:09:25,825 --> 00:09:28,446
Your actions are
grossly insubordinate.

124
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:31,318
I want an explanation. Now.

125
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:36,159
Admiral Bates wants to thank you
for how smoothly things went.

126
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:38,874
He has a surprise for your birthday.

127
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,957
He's flying in from Hawaii.

128
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:46,629
I see. If the admiral wants a party,
I guess we'll have one.

129
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:50,923
Let's keep it simple.
Off-duty personnel can attend...

130
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:52,636
...but watches remain.

131
00:09:52,894 --> 00:09:54,388
Yes, sir.

132
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:56,094
Captain...

133
00:09:56,314 --> 00:09:58,852
...since he wants this to be
a surprise...

134
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,976
...if you could stay here
till we come for you...

135
00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:05,734
- I'll be engrossed in a novel.
- Very good, sir.

136
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:24,882
How's that bouillabaisse?
Heads up!

137
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:39,684
If I'm not mistaken...

138
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,897
...every one of you has orders
to report to the mess deck...

139
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,855
...for the party.

140
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:48,688
Stand fast.

141
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:54,116
Everyone else go! Now.

142
00:10:54,622 --> 00:10:56,413
See you at the party.

143
00:10:59,794 --> 00:11:00,956
You know...

144
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,914
...this does look delicious.

145
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:08,881
It smells like a lard omelet.

146
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:11,387
I put up with your shit...

147
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,095
...because the captain likes
your cooking.

148
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,268
But this time he won't be here
to save you.

149
00:11:17,478 --> 00:11:19,471
Is that right?

150
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:25,432
Little flavor.

151
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,490
You like that?

152
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,657
That's striking an officer!

153
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:35,370
It is not!

154
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:37,782
That's striking an officer!

155
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,414
- Okay! All right!
- Cuff him and throw him in the brig!

156
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:52,217
- In the brig!
- You need the old man's signature.

157
00:11:52,472 --> 00:11:53,586
Good point.

158
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:56,013
Secure him in the meat locker.

159
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,675
Now!
Right now!

160
00:11:58,936 --> 00:11:59,968
Let's go.

161
00:12:00,563 --> 00:12:04,643
Now I know why you're a cook.
You hit like a faggot.

162
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:06,933
Steel.

163
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:11,938
Private Nash...

164
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:14,731
...you came on board in Hawaii?
- Yes, sir.

165
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:16,909
Then you don't know about Ryback?

166
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:22,365
He is an extreme psychopath.

167
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,789
He hates officers.
He hates America.

168
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:29,879
This is the captain's birthday.
I don't want him ruining it.

169
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:32,875
No one speaks to him
or lets him out.

170
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:36,423
If he tries to escape,
shoot him right here.

171
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:39,137
I'm counting on you.

172
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:41,140
Yes, sir.

173
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:43,516
Let's go.

174
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,069
Another cold day in hell.

175
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:06,914
It speaks well for the Navy
that we can entertain a ship at sea.

176
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:08,754
It's so human.

177
00:13:09,006 --> 00:13:11,295
And I love that. Don't you?

178
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,923
I just hope I don't throw up.

179
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:16,127
You'll be fine.

180
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:34,773
I love it. I love it!

181
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,252
<i>Welcome to the USS Missouri.</i>

182
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:10,734
Fantastic!

183
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:16,438
We're looking forward
to a great time.

184
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,903
I love this business!

185
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:24,823
My future wife.

186
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,250
She's landed.

187
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,332
The Bunny's landed. See you.

188
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,839
Private!

189
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:36,883
Doesn't it seem strange
that Krill put me in here?

190
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,417
I ain't listening to you.

191
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,086
Welcome aboard.

192
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:42,097
Guys, make a hole.

193
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,260
Don't let them bother you.
Been at sea too long. You okay?

194
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,762
I still feel really queasy.

195
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:52,518
We'll go to the wardroom,
where you can change.

196
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,062
Let the lady through!

197
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:06,200
Be careful with the cake.
Make sure the wires are covered.

198
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,202
That's the way it goes.

199
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:11,331
- Are you lost?
- No, no. Where do you want us?

200
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:13,289
- Is the band ready?
- Ready.

201
00:15:13,506 --> 00:15:15,297
You're over here.

202
00:15:15,508 --> 00:15:17,465
Starboard side, right now.

203
00:15:20,805 --> 00:15:23,925
You'll knock the captain
off his feet. You're beautiful.

204
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:26,472
For motion sickness. Take two.

205
00:15:26,686 --> 00:15:28,477
Thanks.
What happened to your face?

206
00:15:28,688 --> 00:15:31,393
Cut myself shaving.
The cake's almost ready.

207
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:36,110
We have a room for you to change.
You'll be safe from my men.

208
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:38,770
I'm going to go put on
my party dress.

209
00:15:43,202 --> 00:15:45,907
Don't worry. You can play
this with your eyes shut.

210
00:15:54,005 --> 00:15:55,380
Private!

211
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,250
Let me out!

212
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:01,845
You follow Krill's orders, you'll
go to the brig! Use your head!

213
00:16:03,764 --> 00:16:05,556
Go get my pies out of the oven!

214
00:16:14,108 --> 00:16:16,101
I must be nuts.

215
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,694
Very sick.

216
00:16:28,623 --> 00:16:31,624
We want to give you
a great big welcome...

217
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:36,247
<i>...to the big,
beautiful Missouri lounge...</i>

218
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:42,089
...out here in the middle
of the big beautiful Pacific Ocean.

219
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:45,463
I'm Bad Billy.

220
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,926
And these are
the fabulous Bail Jumpers!

221
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:55,347
I have orders not to talk to you.
Understand? Orders.

222
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,606
You could be held accountable...

223
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,232
...keeping me in here like this.

224
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:02,772
You have to think about that.

225
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:03,980
Private?

226
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,358
He didn't say
you can't talk to the captain.

227
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,111
Go ask him if he wants me in here.

228
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,665
You little E-1 prick.

229
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,754
Lieutenant,
this is absolutely beautiful.

230
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,686
Old man says keep her level.

231
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:44,271
How about an hors d'oeuvre?

232
00:17:48,911 --> 00:17:50,370
What have we here?

233
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:55,414
All right. There's the Twinkies.
Where's Miss July?

234
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,990
And there she is.

235
00:17:57,211 --> 00:17:59,667
Miss July 1989.

236
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,458
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

237
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,590
That's not Miss July.

238
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,421
My God, look at him.

239
00:18:07,472 --> 00:18:09,678
Commander Krill.

240
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:18,773
Welcome to the revolution.

241
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:26,396
This party'll make history.
No wonder he wanted everyone here.

242
00:18:31,913 --> 00:18:34,700
Maybe Krill isn't
such an asshole after all.

243
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:40,252
That's great. Go get the old man.
He's been waiting on you now.

244
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:43,079
All right.

245
00:18:43,883 --> 00:18:45,342
Miss July!

246
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:54,219
We're going to surprise the captain now.

247
00:18:55,394 --> 00:18:58,265
- Have a good party!
- Come on, dear.

248
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:04,440
Where's the chief?

249
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,531
In the meat locker
until after the party.

250
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,487
It's only like 40 degrees in there.

251
00:19:10,743 --> 00:19:13,779
He'll be fine. He's got a guard.

252
00:19:15,206 --> 00:19:18,954
Krill's a maniac.
Tell the captain he spit in my soup.

253
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,038
You got a fire in here.

254
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,922
Get my pies out of the oven!

255
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,621
These pantyhose feel good!

256
00:20:07,633 --> 00:20:10,551
It's okay. I'm here to escort
the captain to the party.

257
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:12,887
Aye, Commander.

258
00:20:14,223 --> 00:20:16,893
- Commander Krill.
- Send him in.

259
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:25,896
I'm your date tonight, Captain.

260
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:41,618
Wait. Wait a minute!

261
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,496
Who is the highest
ranking officer here?

262
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,383
Who is the highest ranking officer
in this room?

263
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,052
Stand up.

264
00:20:52,678 --> 00:20:54,422
Stand up and be recognized.

265
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:59,351
Part the waves there.
Get out of the man's way.

266
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:01,345
Put a light on the man.

267
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:06,230
Now you, sir, are the highest
ranking officer in this room?

268
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:09,349
Yes. Operations officer.
Third in command.

269
00:21:09,612 --> 00:21:12,732
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Commander Green.

270
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,281
Get down!

271
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,412
What's going on?

272
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:25,210
The party's just beginning.

273
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,411
Captain!

274
00:21:29,924 --> 00:21:30,955
Good shot.

275
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,925
Lay down! Hands up!

276
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:34,208
Heads down!

277
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:37,388
What are you looking at?
On the floor!

278
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:38,843
Put your head down.

279
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,009
You want to be good now?

280
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:43,103
What is this, a joke?

281
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:44,688
No joke!

282
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:48,649
I hear gunfire. What's going on?

283
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:55,939
It's done.

284
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:03,781
Four minutes ahead of schedule.

285
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:13,792
Mother Goose,
the quails are in the nest.

286
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:19,629
It's just the music.

287
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:23,805
You got shit for brains.
That's gunfire. Call the bridge.

288
00:22:24,228 --> 00:22:27,431
I don't know who you're talking to.
No one's listening.

289
00:22:27,899 --> 00:22:30,187
I ain't asking you to listen to me.

290
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,857
Call the captain. Listen to him.

291
00:22:41,954 --> 00:22:43,235
Seal it!

292
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:05,182
Eyes on the man in front of you!

293
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:08,598
Goddamn it,
that's the last time I'll tell you!

294
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,276
Let this be a learning experience.

295
00:23:21,494 --> 00:23:24,495
If you resist, we will kill you
and the man next to you.

296
00:23:24,705 --> 00:23:27,909
Now move out of here
in an orderly fashion.

297
00:23:30,628 --> 00:23:31,659
Now!

298
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:07,949
Turn around. Hands on your head.

299
00:24:31,147 --> 00:24:33,223
Where is it?

300
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:36,810
Here it is.

301
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:39,858
Listen to the shit
I've had to put up with.

302
00:24:42,325 --> 00:24:46,572
"Commander Krill has become
increasingly hostile to the crew...

303
00:24:46,829 --> 00:24:50,115
...possibly due to anger over
reviews of his performance.

304
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:55,451
I recommend psychological
evaluation before his next assignment."

305
00:24:59,926 --> 00:25:02,713
Do I look like I need a
psychological evaluation?

306
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:05,347
Not at all.

307
00:25:07,975 --> 00:25:09,470
I got to change.

308
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,355
Behind your head.

309
00:25:23,616 --> 00:25:25,110
Up against the wall.

310
00:25:29,205 --> 00:25:30,913
XO on the bridge.

311
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:33,327
Listen up.

312
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,502
Hands on your head and move
to the counter, right now.

313
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:43,589
Your destination is the fo'c's'le.
Cooperate and you won't be harmed.

314
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:49,974
Change of watch.

315
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,856
You've done a good job,
but you're relieved of duty.

316
00:25:58,609 --> 00:26:00,816
Get your hand off that console.

317
00:26:09,078 --> 00:26:11,616
You're a cheeky bastard. Move out!

318
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:17,992
My God! Bunch of wussies.

319
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,426
The disk, Mr. Pitt.

320
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,843
Guard it with your life.

321
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:32,637
Of course.

322
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,843
Bring up the layout, if you will.

323
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:42,435
- We've overridden their systems.
- We control crypto, CIC...

324
00:26:42,695 --> 00:26:46,396
...engine rooms, boiler rooms,
bridge and all open decks.

325
00:26:46,657 --> 00:26:49,195
We've welded shut the hatches.

326
00:26:49,452 --> 00:26:52,287
A few loose sailors may be berthing...

327
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,539
...or they're caught in nonessential
areas and can go nowhere.

328
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:59,291
- The rest are in the fo'c's'le.
- Excellent.

329
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:02,588
Reactivate the weapons systems,
Mr. Pitt.

330
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:03,830
Mr. Daumer...

331
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,962
...you may deploy the welding crews
and chop up broadway.

332
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,929
Commander Krill,
you're hereby promoted to captain.

333
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:17,678
Congratulations. The ship is yours.

334
00:27:18,147 --> 00:27:19,606
The ship is mine.

335
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,356
Thank you, Billy.
All right!

336
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,647
Can we get something to eat in here?!

337
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,526
Get some food!

338
00:27:34,872 --> 00:27:36,532
Krill warned me you were tricky.

339
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:41,743
I'm not tricky, I'm just freezing.
Something's going on here.

340
00:27:42,004 --> 00:27:44,211
Call the bridge.
No one'll yell at you.

341
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,831
It's just your job.
Check right away.

342
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:49,631
All right.
All right, I'll check.

343
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:51,299
That's all.

344
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:53,216
Do that. And be careful.

345
00:27:57,436 --> 00:27:59,061
'Tis a rare thing.

346
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:02,771
This is good. It'll work.

347
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:06,768
Got a call from Private Nash
on guard duty in the kitchen.

348
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:09,105
Pitt, pull it up.

349
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:12,985
That's an unsecured area.
They can access the whole ship.

350
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:20,291
Ryback. A cook.
A pain-in-the-ass cook.

351
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:21,877
Give me that.

352
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:24,077
Private Nash.

353
00:28:25,256 --> 00:28:28,043
<i>I'm glad you checked in.
I've been with the captain.</i>

354
00:28:28,676 --> 00:28:31,428
Keep Ryback under control
and don't open the door.

355
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,257
Tell him you're sending relief.

356
00:28:34,682 --> 00:28:38,846
Tell him you are sending
somebody to relieve him.

357
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:44,555
Stand your station fast.
I'm sending someone to relieve you.

358
00:28:44,817 --> 00:28:48,862
Is everything okay?
We heard what sounded like gunshots.

359
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:52,190
Gunshots? Oh, that.

360
00:28:52,492 --> 00:28:54,698
Those are party poppers. Firecrackers.

361
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:56,406
Part of the party.

362
00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:59,118
Stand firm until you're relieved.

363
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:01,864
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Over and out.</i>

364
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,838
Anything else you didn't tell us?

365
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,376
Any further memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps?

366
00:29:11,636 --> 00:29:14,802
No other memory lapses
or oversights, perhaps.

367
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:18,756
There's two men. One's locked up.
I'll take care of it.

368
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:24,480
We'll handle it. Secure the galley.
Send Cates and Ziggs.

369
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,149
This Marine's armed.

370
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:28,767
We need more. I'll go.

371
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:31,400
Don't worry. They're professionals.

372
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:34,147
They can handle twenty Marines...

373
00:29:34,408 --> 00:29:36,531
...and 100 cooks.

374
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,865
You're wrong, Ryback. You're wrong.

375
00:29:45,211 --> 00:29:48,461
- They were party poppers.
- You got shit for brains.

376
00:29:48,714 --> 00:29:53,293
I know they brainwashed you,
but you have to question authority.

377
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:55,261
Trust me, boy.

378
00:29:55,513 --> 00:29:58,549
That's gunfire.
Free me and I'll take care of it.

379
00:29:59,183 --> 00:30:03,513
I'll be relieved in a few minutes,
so just shut up and sit tight.

380
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:07,057
Something's going on.
Use your head this time.

381
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,143
Do what you got to do. Let me out.

382
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,066
Or when I'm out,
I'll shoot you myself.

383
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,821
Commander Krill?

384
00:30:21,497 --> 00:30:22,826
Is that you?

385
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:30,168
Get your hands on your head.
Turn around.

386
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:32,251
Get down on your knees.

387
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:33,961
Cross your ankles.

388
00:30:39,974 --> 00:30:41,433
Where's the cook?

389
00:30:41,684 --> 00:30:43,143
In the reefer.

390
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:45,050
Which one?

391
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:17,837
Son of a bitch!

392
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:40,236
We've got an F-18.

393
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,488
They sent an F-18
to look for the chopper.

394
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,034
<i>Heading 315 miles, speed 430,
approximately 8000.</i>

395
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:58,161
207, 61 miles now.

396
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:23,400
<i>430. 5000 now, into descent.</i>

397
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:26,400
<i>We're going down now.</i>

398
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,736
Looks like one helo on deck.

399
00:35:11,704 --> 00:35:13,163
<i>Going in for a closer look.</i>

400
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,916
<i>31 to Missouri, over.</i>

401
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:23,626
Goodbye!

402
00:35:25,802 --> 00:35:27,794
Are you tracking me?

403
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:29,043
<i>Negative.</i>

404
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:32,928
He's locked me up! Mayday.

405
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,860
Welcome to the revolution.

406
00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:54,203
Better call the office.

407
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:19,514
You're in deep kimchi, buddy.

408
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:22,352
Better have it all
in one sock for this one.

409
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:25,896
Claims he was a company man
who worked for you.

410
00:36:26,154 --> 00:36:27,434
What's his name?

411
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:29,321
William Strannix.

412
00:36:30,032 --> 00:36:32,108
Jesus Christ!

413
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:34,651
Not good.

414
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:37,033
Not good.

415
00:36:46,924 --> 00:36:48,122
Mr. Breaker...

416
00:36:49,218 --> 00:36:51,840
...you better be candid
with us here tonight.

417
00:36:52,054 --> 00:36:54,545
We need answers,
and we need them now.

418
00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:01,601
<i>Gentlemen, if any ships or aircraft
approach within 100 miles...</i>

419
00:37:01,856 --> 00:37:05,984
<i>... we will kill the crew and
retaliate using the ship's arsenal.</i>

420
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:10,023
Bill, this is Tom. What's going on?

421
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:13,856
I have 32 Tomahawks under my thumb...

422
00:37:14,118 --> 00:37:16,692
...and all you can do
is alert the media.

423
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:18,914
You don't have the launch codes.

424
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,327
Let me guess.

425
00:37:23,961 --> 00:37:27,081
"5-6-6-0-4-9-9-7-8-0?"

426
00:37:29,842 --> 00:37:31,420
This is insane.

427
00:37:31,677 --> 00:37:33,884
<i>Be careful with that word, Tom.</i>

428
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:39,141
This is Admiral Bates speaking.
Tell us why you're doing this.

429
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,341
<i>Hi, Admiral!</i>

430
00:37:40,603 --> 00:37:44,767
Six months ago, Tom Breaker
canceled Operation Cleopatra.

431
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:50,107
Shortly thereafter, two young men
from Langley tried to cancel me.

432
00:37:50,988 --> 00:37:54,440
<i>Didn't you receive each man's
forefinger in the mail?</i>

433
00:37:58,287 --> 00:37:59,319
Yes.

434
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,617
Did you expect us
to wait for you to try again?

435
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,535
I know things are a little...

436
00:38:06,879 --> 00:38:09,549
<i>...chaotic for you right now.
- Chaotic!</i>

437
00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:11,459
<i>Wake up!</i>

438
00:38:12,677 --> 00:38:17,137
You and I know that chaos and
bedlam are consuming the entire world.

439
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,759
UV rays are only the beginning.
We have an inch of topsoil left.

440
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:22,717
Topsoil?

441
00:38:22,979 --> 00:38:27,771
<i>Sexually transmitted diseases,
depletion of the gene pool.</i>

442
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:29,442
<i>It adds up to oblivion.</i>

443
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:32,481
Governments will fall.
Anarchy will reign.

444
00:38:32,738 --> 00:38:34,648
It's a brave new world.

445
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:37,735
What are you planning to do?

446
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:42,821
<i>Do you realize that whatever I do
is inevitable? Can we agree on that?</i>

447
00:38:43,666 --> 00:38:45,077
Not necessarily.

448
00:38:45,334 --> 00:38:46,579
There you go.

449
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:51,379
You can't argue with me
or negotiate or attempt a ploy.

450
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:54,302
You have to reconsider your philosophy.

451
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:58,597
All right, I'm sorry.
Whatever you decide to do is inevitable.

452
00:38:58,806 --> 00:38:59,837
<i>Look at my life.</i>

453
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:04,346
The life you tried to take.
There was Annapolis, Vietnam, so on.

454
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:07,854
I missed the 60s,
and I believe if I had been there...

455
00:39:08,107 --> 00:39:11,227
...to contribute,
everything would've been fine.

456
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:15,530
Bill, if this is about reliving
the 60s, you can forget it.

457
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:17,324
The movement is dead.

458
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:19,034
Hence the name.

459
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:21,858
It moves a certain distance,
then it stops.

460
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:26,368
Revolution gets its name by always
coming back around in your face.

461
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,705
You tried to kill me,
you son of a bitch.

462
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:32,329
So welcome to the revolution.

463
00:39:32,798 --> 00:39:35,336
There's more to follow.
I'll stay in touch.

464
00:39:39,514 --> 00:39:40,842
He's flipped.

465
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:43,672
He's completely flipped.

466
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:47,853
I want a list of everything
on that ship.

467
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,190
General, here's what we know.

468
00:39:54,862 --> 00:39:59,323
The threat is verifiable. It is real.
I repeat, it is real.

469
00:40:01,202 --> 00:40:03,325
Shit! You son of a bitch.

470
00:40:03,538 --> 00:40:04,818
Think they believe you?

471
00:40:05,081 --> 00:40:08,331
They believe I'm crazy, paranoid
or something.

472
00:40:08,584 --> 00:40:10,292
I have a harpoon locked on.

473
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:11,576
Fire when ready.

474
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,837
Pipe down, men!
Pipe down.

475
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:25,851
Missile away.

476
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:33,388
Missile away.

477
00:40:33,985 --> 00:40:35,064
Oh, boy.

478
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,362
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

479
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:49,498
Bang! You're dead.

480
00:40:52,587 --> 00:40:56,038
- He's taken out satellite relay.
- What doesn't he want us to see?

481
00:40:56,257 --> 00:40:57,585
He wants to blind us.

482
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,216
It's illogical. We can
follow his movement from Pearl.

483
00:41:01,471 --> 00:41:02,881
You can vector an AWACS.

484
00:41:03,347 --> 00:41:06,551
<i>- Or send E-2C from Nimitz.
- Do it.</i>

485
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,512
Wake up the President.

486
00:41:13,399 --> 00:41:14,562
Bring it in.

487
00:41:16,152 --> 00:41:17,943
Keep it coming in.

488
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,566
Cut it fast.
Time is money on this deal.

489
00:41:24,744 --> 00:41:28,611
- They better be competent.
- Get your ass up there!

490
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:31,119
Watch your heads.

491
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,666
Glad I sent you the blueprints.

492
00:41:42,011 --> 00:41:44,929
I have 4 sections this way,
7 sections this way.

493
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:47,968
I'll have it cut and up in an hour.

494
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:55,810
Time is money, on this job!

495
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,062
Time is money.

496
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:05,815
This will cut them to the bone.
Right to the bone.

497
00:42:09,497 --> 00:42:10,991
What's that noise?

498
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,034
That's my beloved crew.

499
00:42:17,505 --> 00:42:21,585
Keep trying. Keep pounding.
Someone will hear us.

500
00:43:34,707 --> 00:43:35,952
Shut the music off.

501
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:48,670
What the hell's going on?

502
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:52,264
What happened to them?

503
00:43:57,104 --> 00:44:01,482
- Who are you and why are you here?
- My name is Jordan Tate.

504
00:44:01,776 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm Miss July '89.

505
00:44:04,695 --> 00:44:07,365
I was hired to jump
out of the cake...

506
00:44:07,615 --> 00:44:10,949
...but I got airsick
on the way here and so...

507
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,651
...this guy gave me these pills.

508
00:44:13,913 --> 00:44:17,163
- I guess I fell asleep.
- What kind of bullshit is this!

509
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:20,034
I am an actress, okay?

510
00:44:20,294 --> 00:44:22,999
<i>I did a Hunter episode
and a Wet 'n Wild video.</i>

511
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:26,625
My agent said I was
going to jump out of the cake.

512
00:44:26,843 --> 00:44:28,218
How many on the chopper?

513
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:30,251
I don't know.

514
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:33,798
It was full.
There was a band and caterers.

515
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:35,006
Where's the crew?

516
00:44:35,977 --> 00:44:38,646
I don't know. I didn't see anything.

517
00:44:39,355 --> 00:44:42,391
You didn't see or hear anything
and don't remember anything?

518
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:45,439
I've done stupid things in my life...

519
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,364
...but believe me,
I don't know anything.

520
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,324
All right, I believe you.

521
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:59,742
So who are you? Are you
a special forces guy or something?

522
00:45:00,334 --> 00:45:01,663
I'm just a cook.

523
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:03,999
A cook?

524
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:06,580
Just a lowly, lowly cook.

525
00:45:07,383 --> 00:45:09,589
My God, we're going to die.

526
00:45:10,303 --> 00:45:13,636
The ship contains 40,000 rounds
of 20mm CWIZ.

527
00:45:14,056 --> 00:45:16,096
Over 100016-inch projectiles.

528
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:21,096
We believe there's 15 harpoon
cruise missiles still aboard...

529
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:22,724
...and 32 Tomahawks.

530
00:45:22,982 --> 00:45:25,022
What kind of Tomahawks?

531
00:45:25,485 --> 00:45:27,027
It's all right. It's okay.

532
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:29,154
Eight of them are specials.

533
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:32,614
Nuclear-tipped. 220 kilotons each.

534
00:45:33,034 --> 00:45:36,901
Mr. Breaker, would you explain how
this nut could hold a top position...

535
00:45:37,121 --> 00:45:38,865
...in an intelligence agency?

536
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:40,915
Would you answer that?

537
00:45:41,375 --> 00:45:46,084
High-level covert operatives
like Strannix are under great stress.

538
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:49,924
They're creative thinkers
who, by their very nature...

539
00:45:50,176 --> 00:45:53,130
Tom trains everyone
in the CIA who's crazy.

540
00:45:53,596 --> 00:45:58,388
All we want to know
is how he got our battleship.

541
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:01,221
That's his specialty.

542
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:07,604
North Korea was refitting a sub
to fire antiship missiles...

543
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,189
...so we sent Strannix in.

544
00:46:09,445 --> 00:46:12,944
You've been financing
this maniac's private army?

545
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,571
You didn't think
it might be a problem?

546
00:46:16,285 --> 00:46:19,239
Once we realized we'd
lost positive control...

547
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:24,501
...we tried to neutralize him.
We missed.

548
00:46:25,169 --> 00:46:26,367
Excuse me.

549
00:46:26,587 --> 00:46:28,959
This North Korean sub...

550
00:46:29,882 --> 00:46:31,674
How do you know he sunk it?

551
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:36,050
Oh, we're positive he sunk it.

552
00:46:36,305 --> 00:46:37,468
Positive.

553
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,023
<i>Roadrunner to Tweety Bird.
Do you read me? Come in.</i>

554
00:46:49,777 --> 00:46:52,149
Tweety Bird to Roadrunner.
We're nearby.

555
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:54,985
<i>- How's it going?
- Sub's up.</i>

556
00:46:55,241 --> 00:46:58,574
<i>- It's all rock and roll to me.
- Any sign of Wile E. Coyote?</i>

557
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:01,497
No. Meet at the birdcage.
Roadrunner out.

558
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:03,410
You're the Roadrunner?

559
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,250
Never been caught.

560
00:47:07,628 --> 00:47:10,298
Problem. Cates and Ziggs are missing.

561
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:13,586
I radioed them repeatedly.
No response.

562
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:16,001
- The last location?
- The galley.

563
00:47:16,262 --> 00:47:19,382
I told you to send more men.
I told you.

564
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,966
Please don't leave me here alone.

565
00:47:22,226 --> 00:47:26,687
Believe me, this is the safest place
you can be. Understand?

566
00:47:28,649 --> 00:47:30,192
Let me out of here!

567
00:47:35,698 --> 00:47:37,240
Let me out!

568
00:47:37,909 --> 00:47:40,863
Do you understand what'll happen
if anybody hears you?

569
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,745
They'll try to kill us.

570
00:47:44,207 --> 00:47:45,665
Now be quiet.

571
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,464
I hate being alone.

572
00:47:53,758 --> 00:47:55,038
Do you hate being dead?

573
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:04,549
Clear!

574
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,239
Put those on.

575
00:48:27,708 --> 00:48:30,662
You're coming with me,
you got to be invisible.

576
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,123
If you're by a hatch and see the enemy,
you become the hatch.

577
00:48:34,382 --> 00:48:38,545
I'm giving you this rifle
with a selector switch on it.

578
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:42,131
One is fully automatic,
one is semiautomatic.

579
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,925
The definition of semiautomatic is,
when you depress the trigger...

580
00:48:46,185 --> 00:48:47,845
...one round will go off.

581
00:48:48,104 --> 00:48:52,682
That's what I want to give you.
Spend one round at a time.

582
00:48:54,402 --> 00:48:55,481
Turn on the lights.

583
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:58,572
Check the breaker box.
It's happened before.

584
00:49:02,493 --> 00:49:04,201
Man who did this is a professional.

585
00:49:07,165 --> 00:49:10,580
- Who is he and why is he on my ship?
- Your ship?

586
00:49:10,835 --> 00:49:14,002
You wouldn't be on this battleship
if not for me.

587
00:49:14,255 --> 00:49:16,413
He's a cook, plain and simple.

588
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:19,669
- A cook didn't do this.
- He came with the captain.

589
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:23,883
I know his routine front and back.
He's good with cooking knives.

590
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:25,970
Cooking knives!

591
00:49:28,978 --> 00:49:30,009
He got lucky.

592
00:49:31,147 --> 00:49:33,982
In my professional opinion,
he is a military reject...

593
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:36,392
...in command of a galley.

594
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:39,018
Get down!

595
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:55,288
- What was that?
- A bomb, jackass.

596
00:49:55,546 --> 00:49:58,002
He used the microwave as a detonator.

597
00:49:58,257 --> 00:50:00,879
Secure everything
between here and the CIC.

598
00:50:01,093 --> 00:50:04,260
You see anything, radio at once
for backup. Understand?

599
00:50:04,472 --> 00:50:06,381
Put these fires out!

600
00:50:09,393 --> 00:50:13,261
I'd like to see the personnel file
on this "simple cook."

601
00:50:14,607 --> 00:50:16,434
Put out these goddamn fires!

602
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:23,235
<i>SEAL Team 5 will launch from Nimitz
aboard a CH-53 Echo...</i>

603
00:50:23,533 --> 00:50:25,656
...with an Apache gunship in support.

604
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,575
At the objective area, the Apache
will take out the ship's radar...

605
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:32,072
...and her electronic warfare systems.

606
00:50:32,416 --> 00:50:35,038
Then SEAL Team 5 will board
and retake the ship.

607
00:50:35,294 --> 00:50:37,702
And the odds of success?

608
00:50:37,922 --> 00:50:40,793
If it's a lunatic who only
partly controls the ship...

609
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,378
...the odds are good.

610
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:45,968
But if he's ready for us...

611
00:50:46,222 --> 00:50:48,547
...if he's prepared to repel boarders...

612
00:50:49,267 --> 00:50:50,761
...the odds are not good.

613
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:55,728
Bear in mind, the operators
from SEAL Team 5 are the best there are.

614
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:00,068
This is our only hope of saving
the crew and retaking the ship.

615
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,735
Let me make one thing
absolutely clear:

616
00:51:04,574 --> 00:51:06,732
If the SEAL team fails...

617
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:11,037
...we will have no alternative
but to launch an air strike...

618
00:51:11,956 --> 00:51:14,162
<i>...and destroy the Missouri.</i>

619
00:51:16,127 --> 00:51:17,918
You know what that means.

620
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:20,671
We'll get her back for you.

621
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,498
Make it happen. Make it happen.

622
00:51:24,302 --> 00:51:27,006
22... 12... perfect.

623
00:51:27,597 --> 00:51:30,930
It's 44 feet from the weather deck
to the missile canisters.

624
00:51:31,184 --> 00:51:34,802
It'll take a half hour to assemble
that section of the crane.

625
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,890
Ryback's file was in the captain's
private cabinet.

626
00:51:41,152 --> 00:51:43,109
Ryback is an ex-SEAL.

627
00:51:43,362 --> 00:51:45,070
The goddamn cook's a SEAL?

628
00:51:45,323 --> 00:51:48,324
Shut up and listen.
"Expert in martial arts...

629
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,782
...explosives, weapons, tactics.

630
00:51:51,037 --> 00:51:54,370
Silver Star. Navy Cross.
Purple Heart with cluster.

631
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:59,792
Security revoked after Panama."
So he could only rate as a yeoman...

632
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:03,292
...or a cook. How little did I know.

633
00:52:03,549 --> 00:52:06,005
We lost two men in the engine room.

634
00:52:06,219 --> 00:52:09,136
You were told to review
every crew member's file.

635
00:52:09,388 --> 00:52:12,674
I know, but I didn't have access
to the captain's files!

636
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:16,018
- I'll get this fucker myself.
- Oh, no, calm down.

637
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,346
- Want to get killed?
- Are you an idiot?

638
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:20,646
- You're calling me an idiot?
- Yes, I am.

639
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,565
Calm down. Get me three roving patrols.
Keep him below the weather deck.

640
00:52:24,821 --> 00:52:26,398
- Move out!
- Stay on schedule!

641
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:29,908
To the bridge!

642
00:52:32,328 --> 00:52:35,282
I'm the girl.
Why do I have to carry everything?

643
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,240
- I support women's lib, don't you?
- When it's in my favor.

644
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,118
<i>- Hear this, all personnel.
- Move ahead.</i>

645
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,419
<i>Beware of booby traps.</i>

646
00:52:44,674 --> 00:52:48,125
Do not pursue hostile parties
into unsecured areas.

647
00:52:48,761 --> 00:52:53,340
<i>Report to Daumer individually
at 5-minute intervals and switch...</i>

648
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,639
<i>... to the alternate frequency.</i>

649
00:52:55,893 --> 00:52:57,008
Now.

650
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:02,558
Goddamn SEAL.

651
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:05,442
I'll carry everything...

652
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:08,525
...if you kill whoever we run into.

653
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:11,525
I have a rule about killing people.

654
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:15,533
Actually, I have two rules. One:

655
00:53:15,788 --> 00:53:18,742
I don't date musicians.
And two: I don't kill people.

656
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:21,622
I'm thrilled to death to hear that.

657
00:53:21,878 --> 00:53:24,795
But it leaves a lot of open territory.
Get up the ladder.

658
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:26,334
- Let's go.
- God!

659
00:53:28,384 --> 00:53:31,136
I think you've got the wrong partner.

660
00:53:34,807 --> 00:53:36,349
Now wait here.

661
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,391
Sit down there.

662
00:53:43,691 --> 00:53:45,600
I'll be back in a minute.

663
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:14,739
What's that?

664
00:55:17,451 --> 00:55:18,696
What is that?

665
00:55:19,453 --> 00:55:21,327
This is a SEAL magnaphone.

666
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:25,625
It's an MX 20-20.
It's a secure satellite uplink.

667
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,038
Like a car phone.

668
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,670
Yeah. Something like that.

669
00:55:39,098 --> 00:55:40,758
Excuse me, this is hot.

670
00:55:45,104 --> 00:55:46,598
You know Casey Ryback?

671
00:55:47,231 --> 00:55:48,512
Chief Ryback?

672
00:55:48,774 --> 00:55:51,692
He's top hand in the Teams.
Wish we had him here.

673
00:55:51,944 --> 00:55:55,029
He's calling on a SEAL magnaphone
from the ship.

674
00:55:55,531 --> 00:55:56,562
What?

675
00:55:57,783 --> 00:56:00,072
Listen. Everyone listen up.

676
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:02,408
<i>Affirmative.</i>

677
00:56:03,247 --> 00:56:05,821
<i>Can you estimate
the size of the force?</i>

678
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,999
I'd say about 30.

679
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:10,287
<i>We'll connect you to Captain Garza.</i>

680
00:56:10,505 --> 00:56:11,963
<i>Stand by.</i>

681
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:13,757
What if he's working for them?

682
00:56:14,842 --> 00:56:18,377
- I guarantee Ryback's a good guy.
- Wait a minute.

683
00:56:19,096 --> 00:56:22,133
We won't take the chance.
Don't tell him our plan.

684
00:56:23,726 --> 00:56:26,478
<i>- Chief Ryback, Captain Garza.
- Glad you're there.</i>

685
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:30,264
What we want you to do
is just feed us on-site intel.

686
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:33,395
This man may be crazy,
but he's a professional.

687
00:56:33,653 --> 00:56:37,697
They're manufacturing a railing
system to offload the Tomahawks.

688
00:56:38,157 --> 00:56:40,482
<i>Believe it or not,
the X O's with them.</i>

689
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,534
Commander Krill's involved?

690
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:45,868
Admiral...

691
00:56:46,707 --> 00:56:48,783
...that means
they control the ship.

692
00:56:49,293 --> 00:56:50,456
Holy God.

693
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:55,288
Chief Ryback,
this is Admiral Bates speaking.

694
00:56:55,967 --> 00:57:00,427
Coordinate your efforts with us.
I want you to keep cool...

695
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:03,593
<i>... and wait for the strike team.
Do you understand?</i>

696
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:06,222
I'll go before they pick up the signal.

697
00:57:06,477 --> 00:57:08,968
<i>- Call us in half an hour.
- Roger that.</i>

698
00:57:09,313 --> 00:57:10,808
You're not a cook.

699
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:14,062
Yeah, well...

700
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:18,280
...I also cook.

701
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:19,990
Get your stuff.

702
00:57:20,533 --> 00:57:23,534
He had an extremely distinguished
career until Panama...

703
00:57:23,786 --> 00:57:26,740
...when most of his team died
due to poor intelligence.

704
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:30,156
Ryback's a warrior. The best there is.

705
00:57:30,418 --> 00:57:33,834
When he got back from Panama,
he punched his officer in charge.

706
00:57:34,088 --> 00:57:37,587
Adams took him on as a cook
so he could finish his 20.

707
00:57:37,842 --> 00:57:39,669
Hold it. Just hold it.

708
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:43,801
What if this toad, Zwieback,
or whatever his name is, is right...

709
00:57:44,056 --> 00:57:48,054
...and the missiles are offloaded
before the SEAL team gets there?

710
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:51,228
There is no way for Mr. Strannix
to get past us.

711
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:55,311
We have AWAC surveillance
and SOSUS in Honolulu...

712
00:57:55,526 --> 00:57:58,397
...tracking every ship and sub at sea.

713
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:01,488
<i>They leave the Missouri,
they're ours.</i>

714
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:05,649
How do we know that Honolulu
isn't his next target?

715
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,865
Tell me that.

716
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:23,045
Take a look at this.

717
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:28,423
- Know what all those lights are for?
- I've been trained.

718
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,890
You can fly that helicopter?

719
00:58:35,566 --> 00:58:38,022
Then we can get out of here, right?

720
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:40,401
Here's the MP5K.

721
00:58:41,113 --> 00:58:43,783
When the dot's on target,
what you see is what you get.

722
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,656
- I told you I don't like guns.
- I know. Neither do I.

723
00:58:48,746 --> 00:58:50,537
Now get back under there.

724
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:23,395
These things are going to sell
like hot cakes!

725
00:59:23,656 --> 00:59:25,234
Absolutely.

726
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:28,905
What'll you do
with the $200 million?

727
00:59:29,162 --> 00:59:30,407
Buy the Presidency.

728
00:59:59,108 --> 01:00:00,816
Someone's moving. Right there!

729
01:00:04,906 --> 01:00:07,776
He's on the flight deck! Go! Go!

730
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,697
Come out of there!

731
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:13,052
Where are you taking me?
I don't know anything!

732
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,008
Let go of me!

733
01:01:18,187 --> 01:01:19,895
Get your hands off me!

734
01:01:20,314 --> 01:01:21,477
Now!

735
01:01:31,617 --> 01:01:32,898
Move!

736
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:45,166
Move!

737
01:01:47,592 --> 01:01:49,501
Stand fast!
Do not pursue that man!

738
01:01:56,726 --> 01:02:00,344
- Secure missile battery three, now!
- Man that hatch!

739
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:02,147
This guy's a pain in the ass!

740
01:02:02,356 --> 01:02:04,314
We got to do something about him.

741
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:06,109
I know what to do.

742
01:02:08,112 --> 01:02:09,191
I do.

743
01:02:12,366 --> 01:02:14,692
This insanity is so logical.

744
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:19,319
There's a sprinkler system
where they're being held.

745
01:02:19,874 --> 01:02:21,154
Mr. Pitt?

746
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:24,242
The fo'c's'le.

747
01:02:25,546 --> 01:02:27,871
Hit a button, it starts to flood.

748
01:02:28,716 --> 01:02:30,922
In a short time, they'll all drown.

749
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:33,342
Ryback'll kill himself to save them.

750
01:02:43,439 --> 01:02:44,981
You're a maniac.

751
01:02:45,233 --> 01:02:46,976
Drowning your own crew.

752
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:49,853
They never liked me anyway.

753
01:02:50,863 --> 01:02:53,152
Bet they fucking love you now.

754
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:02,612
You see this?
These are cut everywhere.

755
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,157
What is it?

756
01:03:04,418 --> 01:03:08,582
They're for a railing system to offload
the missiles onto a ship or sub...

757
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,713
...they'll rendezvous with.

758
01:03:13,094 --> 01:03:14,256
What's that?

759
01:03:15,555 --> 01:03:17,381
Morse code.

760
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:20,554
What're they saying?

761
01:03:22,812 --> 01:03:25,219
"Get me the fuck out of here."

762
01:03:32,572 --> 01:03:34,897
- What's that?
- Get away from the hatch!

763
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:08,058
Guard the door.
Shoot anyone who comes through.

764
01:04:08,608 --> 01:04:09,806
You okay?

765
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:12,016
You okay?

766
01:04:14,363 --> 01:04:15,988
Is this all of you?

767
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,447
Six of us got trapped.
What's happening?

768
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:21,109
We got a problem. Who's this?

769
01:04:21,954 --> 01:04:24,659
Calaway, Gunner's mate,
2nd class, '44, '46.

770
01:04:24,916 --> 01:04:29,328
This is Jordan. She's a casualty
of the situation I'll brief you on.

771
01:04:29,712 --> 01:04:32,001
Nice to see you. You too, Case.

772
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:34,624
Granger, you take this.

773
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:37,839
Get your tools. We've got work to do.

774
01:04:39,138 --> 01:04:41,546
We're jumping into a shit storm here.

775
01:04:50,566 --> 01:04:52,642
Must've been a power surge.

776
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:00,737
That's the last one.

777
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:04,243
This should disable their
weapons systems within a half hour.

778
01:05:04,831 --> 01:05:07,950
Mr. Ryback,
may I have your attention, please?

779
01:05:08,459 --> 01:05:10,701
<i>This is Captain Krill speaking.</i>

780
01:05:15,675 --> 01:05:17,881
I'd like you to look
at the monitors...

781
01:05:18,094 --> 01:05:20,383
<i>... where you are
at this point in time.</i>

782
01:05:22,306 --> 01:05:23,765
<i>Are you watching?</i>

783
01:05:24,433 --> 01:05:26,260
I prepared a special show for you.

784
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,511
<i>Here it goes.</i>

785
01:05:34,944 --> 01:05:37,696
I want you to know
there are no hard feelings.

786
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:41,821
<i>I have no grudge against you...</i>

787
01:05:42,201 --> 01:05:44,158
<i>... or the rest of the crew.</i>

788
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:45,698
You did your best.

789
01:05:52,795 --> 01:05:55,333
Discipline is right out
the window here.

790
01:05:58,718 --> 01:06:00,378
Turn it off.

791
01:06:01,387 --> 01:06:02,502
We got to save them.

792
01:06:02,722 --> 01:06:04,097
They'll have a trap.

793
01:06:04,557 --> 01:06:07,890
But they're expecting me,
not all of us.

794
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:09,811
All of what? I do laundry.

795
01:06:10,271 --> 01:06:13,272
I ironed during the Gulf War.
I ain't cut out for this.

796
01:06:13,483 --> 01:06:15,356
You're in the Navy, remember?

797
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,686
"It's not a job, it's an adventure."

798
01:06:18,070 --> 01:06:20,526
To hell with that.
I'm on the college program.

799
01:06:20,781 --> 01:06:22,062
I'm in.

800
01:06:24,243 --> 01:06:26,651
All right,
I'll stay and watch Miss July.

801
01:06:26,871 --> 01:06:30,038
- Get the lights out in broadway.
- I'm going.

802
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,864
Okay, but the emergency lights
will kick on soon.

803
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:36,420
All right, what the hell.
How does this work?

804
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:56,431
Go!

805
01:07:15,628 --> 01:07:16,908
Take cover! Get down!

806
01:07:20,466 --> 01:07:22,091
Turn it!

807
01:07:24,345 --> 01:07:25,887
Turn the water off!

808
01:07:28,224 --> 01:07:30,382
They're going to get us out!

809
01:07:35,356 --> 01:07:38,476
Pull him out of there!
Pull him out!

810
01:07:44,448 --> 01:07:45,991
Come on, buddy!

811
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:47,941
Breathe!

812
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:50,119
Listen to him!

813
01:07:50,371 --> 01:07:51,865
Hang in there!

814
01:07:55,918 --> 01:07:59,038
<i>Listen, he freed a few men,
and I think...</i>

815
01:07:59,297 --> 01:08:03,460
<i>... they went into the fo'c's'le,
but we got them pinned down.</i>

816
01:08:03,718 --> 01:08:05,841
Kill them if you can't contain them.

817
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:07,554
It worked. They're trapped.

818
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:09,347
- Good.
- Drop the anchor!

819
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,853
This is where it's going to happen.

820
01:08:33,164 --> 01:08:35,869
<i>- Who the hell's this?
- Who the hell's this?</i>

821
01:08:36,167 --> 01:08:40,295
This is Admiral Bates.
I'm trying to get ahold of Ryback.

822
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:43,298
<i>He's in a gunfight.
I'll have to take a message.</i>

823
01:08:43,966 --> 01:08:45,247
What's going on there?

824
01:08:46,219 --> 01:08:48,591
Hold on.
Here.

825
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:52,218
Yes, sir.

826
01:08:52,683 --> 01:08:55,519
Chief Ryback, this is Admiral Bates.

827
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:59,269
I see that you completely
disobeyed my orders. Correct?

828
01:08:59,524 --> 01:09:02,359
<i>Sorry. You can court-martial me
if I live.</i>

829
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:03,559
I see.

830
01:09:04,195 --> 01:09:06,234
Listen to me carefully.

831
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:09,069
SEAL Team 5 is en route.
You understand?

832
01:09:11,744 --> 01:09:14,365
<i>Nimitz air group is our backup.
Understand?</i>

833
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:20,917
Now, since your ass is on the line,
I authorize you...

834
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:25,085
...to do whatever you can
to aid the arrival of the SEALs.

835
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:28,010
Because if I goddamn
can't control you...

836
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:31,253
...I might as well support you.
Correct?

837
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:32,462
<i>Affirmative.</i>

838
01:09:34,892 --> 01:09:37,893
Good luck there, sailor.
I'm out.

839
01:09:38,938 --> 01:09:41,310
They got a lot of trouble on that ship.

840
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:48,102
Here I go.

841
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:05,415
I'm not staying here.

842
01:10:05,673 --> 01:10:07,879
Where're you going? Get back here.

843
01:10:18,769 --> 01:10:21,973
- What're you doing?
- The safest place is behind you.

844
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:25,224
Hug the wall.
Get out of the middle!

845
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:27,934
Miss July, come back here!

846
01:12:04,083 --> 01:12:08,081
<i>TAG leader, this is Cobra escort.
We have you in our sights.</i>

847
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:10,834
<i>You should see us
on your portside now.</i>

848
01:12:18,556 --> 01:12:22,506
Francois, put the money in the Zurich
bank now, or nothing'll happen.

849
01:12:24,729 --> 01:12:27,101
Sell what we got
in MacGregor Aircraft.

850
01:12:27,356 --> 01:12:29,894
It'll go to shit
when they find out about this.

851
01:12:31,152 --> 01:12:33,441
Two choppers trying to sneak in
under our radar.

852
01:12:33,654 --> 01:12:34,686
Strike team.

853
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:38,356
We drive a hard bargain for hard value.

854
01:12:42,497 --> 01:12:47,040
You give me any more trouble,
I'll call Mohammed. Understand?

855
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:49,291
Strike team is in range and locked on.

856
01:12:49,587 --> 01:12:50,618
Kill them.

857
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,047
Not you, Francois.
I'll put my accountant on the line...

858
01:12:54,258 --> 01:12:56,666
...with my account number.
Talk to that frog.

859
01:13:01,808 --> 01:13:03,088
Something's wrong.

860
01:13:03,351 --> 01:13:07,265
We've got a big problem here.
Switch to auxiliary!

861
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:08,595
Nothing.

862
01:13:12,985 --> 01:13:15,655
Shit, I lost the phalanx.
We're sitting ducks.

863
01:13:15,905 --> 01:13:17,862
Get me secure to the sub.

864
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,194
Sub's up.

865
01:13:25,623 --> 01:13:27,912
Coyote, this is Roadrunner. Come in.

866
01:13:51,691 --> 01:13:53,482
Here come the good guys.

867
01:13:59,907 --> 01:14:01,236
One minute!

868
01:14:01,492 --> 01:14:02,523
One minute!

869
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:07,283
The fantail's fouled up!
We're going in on the bow.

870
01:14:14,463 --> 01:14:16,586
What the hell was that?!

871
01:14:38,613 --> 01:14:40,901
It's confirmed. We lost them all.

872
01:14:42,617 --> 01:14:44,693
We have no choice now...

873
01:14:47,872 --> 01:14:50,624
<i>...but full air assault from the Nimitz.</i>

874
01:14:52,335 --> 01:14:55,834
Mr. Trenton,
would you please?

875
01:14:58,174 --> 01:15:01,210
We need more hands on deck
to help tie this sub up.

876
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:02,757
Start offloading.

877
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:07,341
The crane isn't finished.
We got another problem below decks.

878
01:15:07,558 --> 01:15:12,137
Pull four men off the welding crew
to help tie up the sub.

879
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:28,905
My goodness!

880
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:36,418
Daumer, Daumer, Daumer.
Why didn't you hire this person?

881
01:15:36,629 --> 01:15:40,579
Whatever his price would've been,
it would've been worth it.

882
01:16:26,304 --> 01:16:27,798
Bring it up!

883
01:16:28,723 --> 01:16:31,130
Ease it over now.

884
01:18:07,071 --> 01:18:09,064
There's someone in the water!

885
01:18:10,741 --> 01:18:11,904
Behind you!

886
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:14,153
I saw someone in the water!

887
01:18:24,088 --> 01:18:25,203
Hook him!

888
01:18:27,175 --> 01:18:29,132
Hook that son of a bitch!

889
01:18:44,525 --> 01:18:46,317
Check for a bomb!

890
01:19:02,502 --> 01:19:04,660
Who saw him? Come on!

891
01:19:27,151 --> 01:19:28,610
You're incredible.

892
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:33,234
It's a shame
you're not cooking for us.

893
01:19:47,797 --> 01:19:49,540
Next thing I know...

894
01:19:50,508 --> 01:19:52,963
...you'll be dating musicians.

895
01:20:07,608 --> 01:20:08,937
Where's Daumer?

896
01:20:09,318 --> 01:20:10,861
Probably dead.

897
01:20:11,737 --> 01:20:13,481
The bowplane is jammed.

898
01:20:13,781 --> 01:20:14,944
We can't submerge.

899
01:20:17,952 --> 01:20:20,906
I'll handle it.
It'll be operational underway.

900
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:23,489
You fix it, I'll make you an admiral.

901
01:20:23,749 --> 01:20:25,789
Done. Where're you going?

902
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:29,954
- Make Honolulu glow in the dark.
- Outstanding.

903
01:20:30,214 --> 01:20:33,215
I'll meet you 15 miles
due south in the captain's launch.

904
01:20:33,968 --> 01:20:36,424
Rally your men here in zero one.

905
01:20:36,679 --> 01:20:41,590
I need an acetylene torch,
an arc welder and a crowbar, now!

906
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:45,556
- What'd he say?
- He can't fix it.

907
01:20:46,147 --> 01:20:48,305
I'll fix it! Go! Now!

908
01:20:49,817 --> 01:20:51,359
Why can't you speak English?

909
01:20:56,824 --> 01:20:58,532
Hang in there.

910
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:20,759
Talk to me.

911
01:21:22,099 --> 01:21:23,677
There's nothing to say.

912
01:21:24,852 --> 01:21:26,560
Whatever they did...

913
01:21:27,188 --> 01:21:29,181
...they're smarter than I am.

914
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:31,518
Everything's dead.

915
01:21:32,193 --> 01:21:33,224
It's hopeless.

916
01:21:33,486 --> 01:21:36,107
Nothing is hopeless. Take heart.

917
01:21:40,618 --> 01:21:42,611
Give me time, I'll figure it out.

918
01:21:43,246 --> 01:21:45,867
I like your attitude. Excellent.

919
01:21:50,294 --> 01:21:51,575
It's clear.

920
01:21:56,843 --> 01:21:58,586
What the hell..?

921
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:05,473
I'll put it to you in plain English.
It is so simple.

922
01:22:06,018 --> 01:22:08,058
Hammer that rod into place.

923
01:22:08,312 --> 01:22:11,230
Weld it over the bowplane.
Without it, we can't survive.

924
01:22:11,482 --> 01:22:13,558
Make him understand. Now!

925
01:22:24,412 --> 01:22:25,871
Where's Johnson?

926
01:22:26,747 --> 01:22:27,779
He's gone.

927
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,748
They can't get away with this!

928
01:22:30,168 --> 01:22:31,792
What about the five-inch guns?

929
01:22:32,044 --> 01:22:36,587
We offloaded all the armor-piercing
rounds. We got starbursts.

930
01:22:36,841 --> 01:22:38,549
Nothing that will penetrate.

931
01:22:45,016 --> 01:22:46,759
Gunner's mate.

932
01:22:47,268 --> 01:22:48,299
See those?

933
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:52,429
We still got shells for those.

934
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:07,329
I did it.

935
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:11,246
It's charging. In a few minutes
we'll have power to fire.

936
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:12,615
Well done.

937
01:23:20,259 --> 01:23:21,540
Let's go!

938
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,807
Get on those last three bags!

939
01:23:30,478 --> 01:23:31,509
Out of line.

940
01:23:32,104 --> 01:23:34,940
- Another one.
- Watch my hand signals!

941
01:23:35,525 --> 01:23:37,019
Stand clear!

942
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:43,906
Easy, guys, easy.

943
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,583
What's the sub's course and speed?

944
01:23:57,171 --> 01:23:59,378
Course 172. Speed six knots.

945
01:23:59,882 --> 01:24:02,717
Get down the five-inch guns!

946
01:24:02,927 --> 01:24:06,296
- What do you want me to do?
- See those black switches?

947
01:24:06,556 --> 01:24:10,553
- Click them on, one by one.
- lf the sub blows, won't the nukes go?

948
01:24:10,768 --> 01:24:12,677
No. They won't detonate.

949
01:24:12,937 --> 01:24:14,182
Just sink with the sub.

950
01:24:14,438 --> 01:24:15,470
Lower the cradle.

951
01:24:16,065 --> 01:24:17,559
Cradle lowered.

952
01:24:17,817 --> 01:24:20,189
- Ram the projectile.
- Easy.

953
01:24:21,612 --> 01:24:23,439
Ram the powder easy.

954
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:24,729
Real easy!

955
01:24:25,908 --> 01:24:27,153
Starbursts are ready.

956
01:24:27,493 --> 01:24:28,691
Fire starburst!

957
01:24:30,830 --> 01:24:31,945
All right.

958
01:24:32,206 --> 01:24:35,492
You, secure this room.
Get back to work, jack-off!

959
01:24:38,421 --> 01:24:40,164
They're firing at us!

960
01:24:40,756 --> 01:24:42,085
They're just desperate.

961
01:24:42,508 --> 01:24:46,802
Those are starbursts.
They don't have shells to hurt us.

962
01:24:47,054 --> 01:24:48,881
204 degrees, Calaway.

963
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:55,473
Elevate the barrel.

964
01:24:55,855 --> 01:24:57,812
028 degrees.

965
01:25:06,991 --> 01:25:08,189
Fire in the hole.

966
01:25:19,128 --> 01:25:21,619
He's doing it! We're out of time!

967
01:25:21,839 --> 01:25:23,998
They're reloading right now.

968
01:25:24,258 --> 01:25:25,539
Granger, Tackman! Reload!

969
01:25:29,639 --> 01:25:30,884
Lowering cradle.

970
01:25:31,265 --> 01:25:32,428
Scoot over!

971
01:25:35,812 --> 01:25:37,140
Goddamn!

972
01:25:37,355 --> 01:25:38,386
Close the breech.

973
01:25:39,732 --> 01:25:42,519
Lower it. Lower the bowplane!

974
01:25:44,779 --> 01:25:48,148
Pull! It's working! It's working!
Come on, let's go.

975
01:25:48,407 --> 01:25:49,783
241 degrees.

976
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,570
241 degrees back.

977
01:25:52,245 --> 01:25:53,573
Dive!

978
01:25:58,417 --> 01:25:59,616
It's working!

979
01:25:59,877 --> 01:26:02,914
- 204 degrees.
- 204 degrees.

980
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:04,542
This is it.

981
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,800
Ryback is gone.

982
01:26:11,556 --> 01:26:12,635
Let me look.

983
01:26:16,144 --> 01:26:17,223
Fire in the hole!

984
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:35,784
- Direct hit!
- We hit it!

985
01:26:41,377 --> 01:26:43,785
What the hell is going on?

986
01:26:51,512 --> 01:26:55,130
Porky pig. Little red fucker
with the mustache.

987
01:27:00,897 --> 01:27:02,391
All of my life...

988
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:05,140
...Saturday morning cartoons.

989
01:27:05,401 --> 01:27:06,730
The best.

990
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:09,394
Shit.

991
01:27:12,492 --> 01:27:13,867
For example...

992
01:27:14,118 --> 01:27:18,447
...remember those two little shrimps
coming in, riding seahorses...

993
01:27:18,789 --> 01:27:20,699
...little chaps, little pistols?

994
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:23,081
Shooting over their shoulders.

995
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:25,751
Rescue that lobster from the...

996
01:27:26,797 --> 01:27:28,256
...Swedish cook.

997
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,630
Funniest thing I ever saw!

998
01:27:30,885 --> 01:27:32,759
- Splendid work, by the way.
- Strannix!

999
01:27:33,012 --> 01:27:34,672
Splendid work!

1000
01:27:34,972 --> 01:27:36,301
My, my, my...

1001
01:27:36,599 --> 01:27:39,386
...how hell doth quicken the spirit.

1002
01:27:40,770 --> 01:27:42,893
- Tomahawks!
- They're up and ready.

1003
01:27:43,105 --> 01:27:44,137
Where?

1004
01:27:44,315 --> 01:27:47,102
- Fire control.
- Of course! The fire control.

1005
01:27:47,568 --> 01:27:50,024
Chips and dips on the weather deck.

1006
01:27:50,363 --> 01:27:53,447
Motor launch is waiting!
All hands!

1007
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,363
Clear out of here!

1008
01:28:00,957 --> 01:28:02,155
Let's go.

1009
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:05,450
Four minutes.

1010
01:28:06,712 --> 01:28:08,871
Meet us at the motor launch.

1011
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,750
Four little minutes.

1012
01:28:13,219 --> 01:28:14,382
Home run.

1013
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:18,968
We did it!

1014
01:28:19,225 --> 01:28:21,301
This little piggy went to market.

1015
01:28:22,812 --> 01:28:24,888
This little piggy stayed home.

1016
01:28:25,648 --> 01:28:27,190
And this little piggy...

1017
01:28:27,608 --> 01:28:29,980
Oh, mama. Oh, mama.

1018
01:28:33,531 --> 01:28:35,654
All the way home!

1019
01:28:59,765 --> 01:29:01,176
Happy trails.

1020
01:29:02,894 --> 01:29:05,645
In the captain's launch,
there's the MX 20-20...

1021
01:29:05,897 --> 01:29:08,981
...the SEAL magnaphone.
Bring it here. Take her with you.

1022
01:29:09,275 --> 01:29:10,686
The car phone.

1023
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:22,402
Admiral?

1024
01:29:22,663 --> 01:29:26,079
<i>The Nimitz is tracking two Tomahawks
launched from the ship.</i>

1025
01:29:26,334 --> 01:29:27,828
- Where're they headed?
- Honolulu.

1026
01:29:28,085 --> 01:29:29,284
Oh, God.

1027
01:29:29,712 --> 01:29:32,915
- What's the flight time?
- 24 minutes, sir.

1028
01:29:33,716 --> 01:29:38,045
<i>- Can we destroy them in the air?
- Destruct codes are on the Missouri.</i>

1029
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,925
Scramble Navy and Air Force
fighters from Pearl.

1030
01:29:41,182 --> 01:29:45,476
What are the consequences
of missiles dropping on Honolulu?

1031
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:50,357
About a million people will reach
10,000 degrees Fahrenheit...

1032
01:29:50,608 --> 01:29:52,316
...in less than a second.

1033
01:29:56,948 --> 01:29:58,406
Mr. Secretary...

1034
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:02,034
We'll just blame it on the cook.

1035
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:04,204
Absolutely.

1036
01:30:09,293 --> 01:30:10,835
Take it north.

1037
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:13,539
Roger that. Heading north.

1038
01:31:42,136 --> 01:31:43,595
I'll take that weapon.

1039
01:31:44,514 --> 01:31:45,759
Quietly.

1040
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:47,678
Now.

1041
01:31:57,610 --> 01:31:59,188
You look familiar.

1042
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:01,195
I know you, don't I?

1043
01:32:01,447 --> 01:32:03,107
I think you do.

1044
01:32:05,993 --> 01:32:07,025
Been a long time.

1045
01:32:07,703 --> 01:32:08,948
Yes, sir. It has.

1046
01:32:09,205 --> 01:32:10,284
Turn around.

1047
01:32:11,541 --> 01:32:13,533
We'll have a tour. Step forward.

1048
01:32:17,547 --> 01:32:18,827
Here we have...

1049
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:20,584
...our Tomahawks...

1050
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:24,467
...speeding their way to the sunny
Aloha State. Turn around.

1051
01:32:25,388 --> 01:32:26,586
As you see...

1052
01:32:27,849 --> 01:32:29,343
...there will be no return.

1053
01:32:29,851 --> 01:32:31,309
And I got the key.

1054
01:32:31,644 --> 01:32:34,016
The lock is broken. Step forward.

1055
01:32:34,272 --> 01:32:35,814
Sit over there.

1056
01:32:36,816 --> 01:32:39,651
You'll watch
the end of the world on TV.

1057
01:32:40,903 --> 01:32:42,314
Put your feet up.

1058
01:32:42,572 --> 01:32:43,734
Relax.

1059
01:32:46,993 --> 01:32:48,403
You know, you're good.

1060
01:32:49,328 --> 01:32:50,988
You are really good.

1061
01:32:51,414 --> 01:32:53,323
It's a shame to kill you.

1062
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:56,743
Behold my finest work.

1063
01:32:57,003 --> 01:32:59,042
Do me a favor.
Tell me something.

1064
01:32:59,755 --> 01:33:03,290
You really think blowing up
a bunch of innocent people...

1065
01:33:03,759 --> 01:33:05,337
...will change anything?

1066
01:33:05,595 --> 01:33:07,172
What made you flip like this?

1067
01:33:07,388 --> 01:33:10,591
I got tired of coming up with
desperate solutions...

1068
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:14,053
...to impossible problems
created by other people.

1069
01:33:14,312 --> 01:33:18,261
All your ridiculous,
pitiful antics won't change a thing.

1070
01:33:18,524 --> 01:33:19,983
You and I...

1071
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:23,564
...we're puppets
in the same sick play.

1072
01:33:24,155 --> 01:33:25,697
We serve the same master...

1073
01:33:27,033 --> 01:33:31,493
...and he's an ungrateful lunatic.
There's nothing we can do about it.

1074
01:33:31,871 --> 01:33:33,282
You and I are the same.

1075
01:33:33,498 --> 01:33:36,368
No. There's a difference, my man.

1076
01:33:37,585 --> 01:33:39,827
You have faith. I don't.

1077
01:34:35,101 --> 01:34:37,343
Keep the faith, Strannix.

1078
01:34:46,779 --> 01:34:48,772
Locked on my nose, 15 miles.

1079
01:34:53,202 --> 01:34:55,872
Five miles, on target.
Weapon status, clear.

1080
01:34:56,372 --> 01:34:57,653
Roger.

1081
01:35:03,671 --> 01:35:04,702
Admiral...

1082
01:35:07,258 --> 01:35:08,966
They intercepted one missile.

1083
01:35:09,594 --> 01:35:10,756
And the other one?

1084
01:35:11,012 --> 01:35:12,470
It slipped through.

1085
01:35:30,281 --> 01:35:31,444
Chief...

1086
01:35:31,741 --> 01:35:36,070
...we've only got time for one shot.
So we'll do it by the numbers.

1087
01:35:37,038 --> 01:35:38,615
<i>Load the disk.</i>

1088
01:35:38,873 --> 01:35:40,533
Now punch 4-7.

1089
01:35:40,750 --> 01:35:42,493
<i>You're now on KU.</i>

1090
01:35:45,671 --> 01:35:48,127
Code is 6, 4...

1091
01:35:48,674 --> 01:35:50,299
...3, 5...

1092
01:35:50,676 --> 01:35:52,468
<i>... 0, 0.</i>

1093
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:56,136
That's 643500.
Is my read-back correct?

1094
01:35:56,390 --> 01:35:57,470
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1095
01:36:08,486 --> 01:36:09,517
Stand by.

1096
01:36:31,843 --> 01:36:34,298
<i>Got it!
Nimitz is no longer tracking.</i>

1097
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:37,556
Good man, Ryback!

1098
01:36:42,186 --> 01:36:45,472
Sir, call off your bombers.
Call off your bombers.

1099
01:36:45,982 --> 01:36:49,315
We're calling off the aircraft.
We're calling them off.

1100
01:36:49,569 --> 01:36:52,356
Thanks, Ryback. Great job!
Great job!

1101
01:36:52,655 --> 01:36:57,151
Want to go swimming?
I got a Zodiac and some C-rays...

1102
01:36:57,743 --> 01:36:59,535
...a little umbrella...

1103
01:36:59,787 --> 01:37:01,068
I'll go with you.

1104
01:37:04,292 --> 01:37:06,913
She's all right! She's all right!

1105
01:37:08,671 --> 01:37:10,960
Good, good, all of you guys.

1106
01:37:11,215 --> 01:37:12,246
Great!

1107
01:37:12,884 --> 01:37:14,164
Good job!

1108
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:21,641
Hold on in there,
we'll get you out in a minute!

1109
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:40,945
What'd I miss, chief?

1110
01:37:50,087 --> 01:37:53,871
You'll need 3 or 4 stitches.
Come to the infirmary.

1111
01:37:54,091 --> 01:37:56,167
I'm afraid of needles, you know.

1112
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:02,300
- What's for breakfast, Case?
- Subs, Tackman. Subs!

1113
01:38:03,309 --> 01:38:05,136
Case, show me a move.

1114
01:38:05,353 --> 01:38:06,930
Here's one move.

1115
01:38:37,677 --> 01:38:40,381
Present arms!
