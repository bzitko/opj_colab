1
00:03:28,852 --> 00:03:30,365
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:31,487
Cash.

3
00:03:33,652 --> 00:03:35,131
Make it out to...

4
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,209
...Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:38,641
$788.30.

6
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:26,890
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:28,684
l can't. l'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,400
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:33,006
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:35,163
l saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,606
l already checked.

12
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,127
Coffee?

13
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,407
No school today?

14
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:42,564
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

15
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,210
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:05:47,892 --> 00:05:49,883
He's already a half an hour late.

17
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:53,489
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

18
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:55,121
l'll make coffee.

19
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,327
Out of time.

20
00:06:08,692 --> 00:06:11,160
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:13,850
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:16,806
l don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:19,611
-Did you check in your bathroom?
-l checked everywhere!

24
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,045
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,247
Find them!

26
00:06:22,372 --> 00:06:25,170
-Mom, pay attention!
-All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,004
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:28,241
l won't be ready!

29
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:29,890
-l can't be late.
-You won't.

30
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,405
l will be late!

31
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,605
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:37,206
lt's all right, baby. lt's all right.

33
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:41,250
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

34
00:06:41,332 --> 00:06:45,041
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. l promise you.

35
00:06:56,052 --> 00:06:57,610
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:10,082
What's your name?

37
00:07:10,172 --> 00:07:11,366
Waingro.

38
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:21,086
You're Michael?

39
00:07:33,572 --> 00:07:35,722
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,771
All the time.

41
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,411
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:39,572 --> 00:07:40,641
Real tight.

43
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:45,008
lf this works good,
l'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:47,681
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:07:57,892 --> 00:07:59,120
How's he doing?

46
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:00,571
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:01,412 --> 00:08:02,845
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,243
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,764
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

50
00:08:08,852 --> 00:08:09,921
Okay.

51
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:34,564
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

52
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:36,128
Get set.

53
00:08:36,372 --> 00:08:37,407
l am.

54
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,727
Here we go.

55
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,641
21 1 !

56
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,525
We're being held up!

57
00:09:54,092 --> 00:09:57,004
-<i>2 1 1 alarm. Armored car.</i>
-There's the call.

58
00:09:57,412 --> 00:09:58,447
<i>Three minutes.</i>

59
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:00,848
Clear!

60
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,170
Eighty seconds left!

61
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,164
Get back! Get back!

62
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:09,487
Get back!

63
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:15,445
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

64
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:16,527
Cool it!

65
00:11:28,372 --> 00:11:29,487
l got it.

66
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:30,927
Got it.

67
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,929
You had to fuck with me.

68
00:11:36,292 --> 00:11:37,964
Want to fuck with me?

69
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:03,964
What are you doing? What did he do?

70
00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:05,485
He was making a move.

71
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,971
Dumb motherfucker.

72
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,687
l heard them.

73
00:13:09,012 --> 00:13:10,525
$1.6 million....

74
00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:13,972
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

75
00:13:14,132 --> 00:13:16,009
Here's $150,000 front money.

76
00:13:16,852 --> 00:13:18,888
Get you the rest in two, three days.

77
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:21,491
Who owned these?

78
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:27,203
"Malibu Equity and lnvestments."

79
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:29,245
Roger Van Zant.

80
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:31,084
Owns banks in the Caymans...

81
00:13:31,172 --> 00:13:34,926
...runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

82
00:13:35,252 --> 00:13:36,207
So?

83
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:38,203
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

84
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:39,441
He's insured.

85
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,330
That's the point. He collects
100 percent from the insurance.

86
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:45,972
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

87
00:13:46,052 --> 00:13:49,965
...for 60 percent of their value. Makes
40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

88
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:54,849
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

89
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:56,687
Try it on.

90
00:13:57,732 --> 00:13:58,687
Kelso called.

91
00:13:58,772 --> 00:13:59,841
About what?

92
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:02,771
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

93
00:14:03,172 --> 00:14:05,163
l don't need his score. l got my own.

94
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:07,562
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

95
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:09,246
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

96
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:10,606
What happened?

97
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,166
Don't ask.

98
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:48,127
Find the ambulance?

99
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:51,284
-Dumped it four blocks from here.
-22nd Street.

100
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:55,084
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

101
00:14:57,492 --> 00:15:01,485
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

102
00:15:03,812 --> 00:15:05,643
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

103
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:08,844
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

104
00:15:09,052 --> 00:15:10,326
You taking this one?

105
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,923
Or does it stay in Division?

106
00:15:14,052 --> 00:15:17,408
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-1 1 to you?

107
00:15:17,492 --> 00:15:19,323
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

108
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,371
We got three motorists.

109
00:15:21,452 --> 00:15:23,807
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

110
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:26,360
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

111
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:29,245
Did he lD anybody?

112
00:15:29,332 --> 00:15:31,721
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

113
00:15:33,972 --> 00:15:35,530
What about them?

114
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:39,363
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

115
00:15:39,852 --> 00:15:40,523
Smart.

116
00:15:40,652 --> 00:15:42,688
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

117
00:15:43,572 --> 00:15:45,244
Now, l figure this guy...

118
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,530
...went for that hold-out piece,
ankle holster.

119
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,361
From here...

120
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:51,847
...bang, bang...

121
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:53,365
...bang, bang, bang.

122
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:54,767
This side.

123
00:15:55,012 --> 00:15:58,721
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

124
00:15:59,852 --> 00:16:02,764
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

125
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:04,001
Probably executed.

126
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:08,560
lt was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

127
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:10,364
They ignored the loose cash.

128
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:13,171
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

129
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:15,971
Which means they knew
our response time to a 21 1...

130
00:16:16,052 --> 00:16:18,612
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

131
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,482
...escaped in under three minutes.

132
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:24,325
lt's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

133
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:25,646
Two freeways...

134
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,245
...within a quarter of a mile.

135
00:16:27,332 --> 00:16:28,526
Traffic video camera?

136
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,888
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

137
00:16:30,972 --> 00:16:32,451
You recognize the M.O.?

138
00:16:32,532 --> 00:16:33,681
M.O...

139
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:35,485
...is that they're good.

140
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:39,645
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

141
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,051
...they didn't hesitate.

142
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:44,920
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

143
00:16:45,332 --> 00:16:46,924
Why leave a living witness?

144
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,970
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

145
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:54,444
The shape charge.

146
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:58,327
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

147
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,368
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

148
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:03,963
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

149
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:07,444
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBl.
You'll get the phone book.

150
00:17:07,532 --> 00:17:10,285
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

151
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:15,048
Check the usual fences. You and l will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

152
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,441
l want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

153
00:17:17,612 --> 00:17:18,965
Hang in with Forensics.

154
00:17:19,132 --> 00:17:21,692
From the bomb squad,
l want the explosive.

155
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:24,571
lf we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

156
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,692
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

157
00:17:36,452 --> 00:17:37,931
Anyone want some pie?

158
00:17:47,172 --> 00:17:48,685
Gotta go to the john.

159
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:21,921
l had to get it on. He was making a move.
l had to get it on.

160
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:37,969
Split's in the car.
l took out of ours evenly...

161
00:18:39,212 --> 00:18:41,203
...to make up for his full end...

162
00:18:41,892 --> 00:18:45,805
...'cause l want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

163
00:19:23,092 --> 00:19:23,968
Hold it!

164
00:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,246
Where's the rest?

165
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:04,051
We're late. You look too good to go out.

166
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:06,203
l'll just jump you right here.

167
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,132
-Where is it?
-Squared the bookies, baby.

168
00:21:12,332 --> 00:21:15,483
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

169
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:16,448
Come on.

170
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:18,170
You gotta be kidding me.

171
00:21:19,932 --> 00:21:20,842
Honey...

172
00:21:20,972 --> 00:21:25,523
...it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

173
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:26,608
Let's go.

174
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,171
Get your coat.

175
00:21:30,052 --> 00:21:33,044
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.

176
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:34,491
What does that mean?

177
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:38,651
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

178
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,848
...because l married a gambling junkie.

179
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,084
Get in the fucking car.

180
00:21:44,772 --> 00:21:46,410
What am l doing in here?

181
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:47,888
You're not!

182
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:50,566
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

183
00:21:50,652 --> 00:21:52,210
...in the kitchen on your way out!

184
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:55,364
-Are we going?
-Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

185
00:21:58,052 --> 00:21:59,724
Don't even think about....

186
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:25,681
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

187
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,684
Albert Torena call Vincent?

188
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:30,927
No.

189
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:32,491
Report came in.

190
00:22:33,092 --> 00:22:35,652
<i>The explosive was Dy-Ex,</i>
<i>used in demolition.</i>

191
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:37,763
<i>You can pick it up in Nevada...</i>

192
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:39,405
...Arizona, New Mexico.

193
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,410
Too common to trace a sale.

194
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:43,290
That's wonderful.

195
00:23:02,652 --> 00:23:03,641
You all right?

196
00:23:04,212 --> 00:23:06,282
What happened? Where have you been?

197
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:07,887
Work.

198
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:10,810
Lauren's dad show up?

199
00:23:12,452 --> 00:23:13,487
Didn't call...

200
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,291
...didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

201
00:23:17,612 --> 00:23:21,321
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

202
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:24,926
l don't know.

203
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:27,291
Fucking jerk.

204
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:30,126
ls she okay?

205
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:33,163
She's been in her room all day.

206
00:23:33,332 --> 00:23:35,892
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am l.

207
00:23:36,452 --> 00:23:37,885
l made dinner...

208
00:23:38,252 --> 00:23:40,163
...for us, four hours ago.

209
00:23:41,812 --> 00:23:44,724
Every time l try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

210
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:46,131
...you withdraw.

211
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:50,289
l got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

212
00:23:50,612 --> 00:23:52,921
...off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

213
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,451
l'm sorry...

214
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,524
...if the goddamn...

215
00:23:57,172 --> 00:23:58,446
...chicken...

216
00:23:59,172 --> 00:24:00,764
...got overcooked.

217
00:24:55,132 --> 00:24:56,247
Coffee, sir?

218
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:57,367
Please.

219
00:25:02,812 --> 00:25:04,450
Will you pass the cream?

220
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:08,002
Thanks.

221
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:09,286
What'd you get?

222
00:25:10,452 --> 00:25:11,282
What?

223
00:25:12,372 --> 00:25:13,805
What are you reading?

224
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:20,691
Book about metals.

225
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:26,123
<i>Stress Fractures in Titanium.</i>

226
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,010
What kind of work do you do?

227
00:25:33,012 --> 00:25:36,163
Lady, why are you so interested
in what l read or what l do?

228
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,090
l've seen you in the store.

229
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:43,400
What store?

230
00:25:43,772 --> 00:25:45,728
Hennessey and lngalls. l work there.

231
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:49,961
lf you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

232
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,770
l'm sorry l bothered you.

233
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:04,729
l didn't mean to be rude.
l didn't recognize you.

234
00:26:05,532 --> 00:26:07,762
l work in metals. l'm a salesman.

235
00:26:08,052 --> 00:26:09,371
My name's Neil.

236
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:15,601
l'm Eady.

237
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:19,890
You like working there?

238
00:26:21,532 --> 00:26:22,601
Sure.

239
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:26,801
l get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

240
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:28,041
What area?

241
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:29,965
Graphic design.

242
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:33,770
l do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

243
00:26:34,452 --> 00:26:37,205
...the store's a day job
until l get enough going.

244
00:26:37,372 --> 00:26:38,930
Who do you do that for?

245
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,251
A restaurant.

246
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,643
l did their menus, and...

247
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,282
...a small record label.

248
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:52,401
CDs.

249
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:54,610
l've done two so far.

250
00:26:56,852 --> 00:26:58,490
You go to school for that?

251
00:26:58,972 --> 00:26:59,927
Yeah.

252
00:27:01,012 --> 00:27:02,331
l went to Parsons.

253
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:03,601
Where's that?

254
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:05,001
New York City.

255
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,330
How long you been here?

256
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:09,691
About a year.

257
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:11,567
Like it?

258
00:27:13,492 --> 00:27:16,211
Not really. l'm mostly here for the work.

259
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:25,210
Live in this neighborhood?

260
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,965
No, l live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

261
00:27:30,772 --> 00:27:32,171
lt's a little house l rent.

262
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:35,722
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

263
00:27:37,212 --> 00:27:38,406
What about you?

264
00:27:38,492 --> 00:27:39,720
l live up here.

265
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,445
That's very funny.

266
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,602
Where's your family from originally?

267
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:51,730
They're Scotch-lrish.

268
00:27:52,532 --> 00:27:54,488
They emigrated to Appalachia...

269
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,563
...in the late 1700s.

270
00:27:59,252 --> 00:28:00,685
Where are you from?

271
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:02,646
The Bay area.

272
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:05,371
Your folks there?

273
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:10,681
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

274
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,285
...l don't know where he is.

275
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:13,964
Got a brother somewhere.

276
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,483
You have a tight family. l can tell.

277
00:28:22,772 --> 00:28:23,761
Right?

278
00:28:23,932 --> 00:28:25,206
You're right.

279
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:36,204
City of lights.

280
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:40,965
ln Fiji, they have...

281
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,601
...iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

282
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,882
That's what it looks like out there.

283
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:50,326
You been there?

284
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:53,489
No, l'm going there someday.

285
00:29:02,172 --> 00:29:03,491
You travel a lot?

286
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,088
Yeah.

287
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,370
Traveling make you lonely?

288
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:16,163
l'm alone. l am not...

289
00:29:16,572 --> 00:29:17,846
...lonely.

290
00:29:18,172 --> 00:29:19,207
You?

291
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,085
Real lonely.

292
00:31:21,972 --> 00:31:23,121
Albert!

293
00:31:25,772 --> 00:31:26,807
Shit!

294
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:30,172
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

295
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:33,287
You were supposed to get back to me.

296
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:35,204
Where the fuck you been?

297
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:37,685
l couldn't break free.

298
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:39,728
Let's violate his ass right now.

299
00:31:39,892 --> 00:31:41,371
l do for you...

300
00:31:41,612 --> 00:31:43,887
...you don't do for me, is that it?

301
00:31:44,532 --> 00:31:48,810
Listen, man. l swear, l was out all night.
l'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

302
00:31:48,972 --> 00:31:51,202
That's got nothing to do with me.

303
00:31:51,412 --> 00:31:55,849
l'm cutting it smooth. l'm generating
leads and shit for you. l'm a dancer.

304
00:31:56,012 --> 00:31:57,286
You bullshit.

305
00:31:57,452 --> 00:31:59,807
l paged your ass all day.
l hate fucking paging.

306
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:02,360
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

307
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:05,250
Where's your empathy?
lt's a substance abuse problem.

308
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:08,847
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

309
00:32:08,932 --> 00:32:10,206
You fall in love?

310
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:12,770
Did you fall in love...

311
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:15,324
...and went off somewhere?

312
00:32:15,412 --> 00:32:17,562
Tell me that, l'll settle for it.

313
00:32:19,692 --> 00:32:21,125
Give me all you got!

314
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:22,930
Give me all you got!

315
00:32:23,572 --> 00:32:26,723
l swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

316
00:32:26,932 --> 00:32:28,490
l heard Richard?

317
00:32:29,172 --> 00:32:30,810
He's going to talk to you.

318
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,050
He's gonna meet you tonight.

319
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:35,611
He's not here, is he?

320
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,091
No, he'll meet you tonight.

321
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,651
What happened to now?

322
00:32:38,932 --> 00:32:42,447
l implored him because l knew
you was coming this a.m.

323
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:43,567
Bullshit.

324
00:32:43,732 --> 00:32:45,563
l swear. He said no...

325
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:47,969
...'cause he in Phoenix.

326
00:32:48,172 --> 00:32:50,367
"By the time l get to Phoenix

327
00:32:50,932 --> 00:32:52,570
"He'll be rising

328
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:55,884
"He'll probably leave a note

329
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:57,725
"Right on the door"

330
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,882
Tonight's the best l can do for you.

331
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:04,370
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

332
00:33:06,132 --> 00:33:07,201
At 2:00 a.m.

333
00:33:07,532 --> 00:33:08,282
Be there.

334
00:33:08,372 --> 00:33:09,930
You be there too.

335
00:33:10,452 --> 00:33:12,761
l can't be there, man. l got things to do.

336
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:15,605
l got things to do, l got places to be.

337
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:17,921
Be there.

338
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:26,288
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

339
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:31,047
What is it?

340
00:33:32,692 --> 00:33:33,920
lt's a bank.

341
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,682
lt depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

342
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:39,763
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

343
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:42,924
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

344
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,485
On the prowl or strong?

345
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:45,641
Strong. Through the door.

346
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,801
How many guys?

347
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:50,521
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

348
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,968
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

349
00:33:54,612 --> 00:33:56,330
Sounds like a cowboy score.

350
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,928
They hit the hold-up alarms,
l gotta get out before the cops show.

351
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:02,922
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

352
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:04,964
Two Telco and a cellular.

353
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:09,486
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

354
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:11,370
...the night before...

355
00:34:11,572 --> 00:34:12,846
...you cut in...

356
00:34:13,012 --> 00:34:15,526
...and trick out
the alarm system computer...

357
00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:16,920
...to turn itself...

358
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:19,048
...and the video recorders off...

359
00:34:19,372 --> 00:34:21,283
...20 minutes before you enter.

360
00:34:21,772 --> 00:34:23,728
Architectural, electrical plans?

361
00:34:23,892 --> 00:34:24,881
l got that.

362
00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:27,805
l got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

363
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,565
What's the estimate?

364
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:35,404
$12.1, $12.2 million.

365
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:39,847
You're on.

366
00:34:40,932 --> 00:34:42,126
Congratulations.

367
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:45,963
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

368
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,682
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

369
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:51,731
My way, you get 100 percent
from the insurance company...

370
00:34:51,812 --> 00:34:53,689
...take the bonds back from us...

371
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:57,162
<i>...at 60 cents on the dollar</i>
<i>and make yourself another 40 percent.</i>

372
00:34:59,092 --> 00:35:01,652
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

373
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:04,171
Sure, you got a deal.

374
00:35:04,892 --> 00:35:08,123
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

375
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,331
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

376
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:12,721
Yeah, okay.

377
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:14,925
Nice talking to you.

378
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:17,524
You gonna deal with these guys?

379
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:20,365
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

380
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:23,007
l'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

381
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:26,562
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary lsland's Offshore.

382
00:35:31,052 --> 00:35:33,691
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

383
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:36,969
l have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

384
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,644
How'd you get this information?

385
00:35:38,732 --> 00:35:40,051
Just comes to you.

386
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:42,282
This stuff just flies through the air.

387
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:45,887
lt's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

388
00:35:45,972 --> 00:35:47,530
l know how to grab it.

389
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:54,764
Okay, here we go.

390
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:56,685
$13.9 million.

391
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:01,571
-l bought it.
-Good.

392
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,405
What did l tell you?

393
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:08,007
Here.

394
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:11,970
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

395
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:14,247
How is he?

396
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:16,045
He's a businessman.

397
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:54,125
Chris is at my place.

398
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,281
What's wrong?

399
00:36:58,572 --> 00:37:00,369
Husband-and-wife stuff.

400
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,610
l'll let him sleep it off.

401
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:17,805
What happened to you?

402
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:23,803
When will you get some furniture?

403
00:37:23,892 --> 00:37:25,530
When l get around to it.

404
00:37:28,052 --> 00:37:29,929
Charlene's gonna leave me.

405
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:33,008
Why?

406
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,248
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

407
00:37:39,212 --> 00:37:41,203
With everything we've been doing?

408
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:44,812
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

409
00:37:45,652 --> 00:37:47,563
When you gonna get an old lady?

410
00:37:47,692 --> 00:37:49,284
When l get around to it.

411
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:53,608
You got something else on the side?

412
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:56,366
Nothing regular.

413
00:37:57,292 --> 00:37:59,362
She got something else on the side?

414
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:00,726
-No.
-You sure?

415
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,245
Yeah, l'm sure.

416
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:07,243
l don't know what you're doing.

417
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:12,207
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

418
00:38:12,692 --> 00:38:16,048
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

419
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:20,603
"...that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

420
00:38:20,972 --> 00:38:22,121
Remember that?

421
00:38:28,852 --> 00:38:31,525
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

422
00:38:45,012 --> 00:38:47,287
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

423
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,250
...then l drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

424
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:51,771
Bank? What bank?

425
00:38:52,212 --> 00:38:54,885
What about the platinum thing?
lt's ready to fall.

426
00:38:54,972 --> 00:38:56,803
That goes too. Then the bank.

427
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:02,125
Want some breakfast?

428
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:10,611
Are you okay?

429
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:12,371
Yeah, sugar.

430
00:39:19,532 --> 00:39:20,681
For real.

431
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:21,887
l'll do good.

432
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,491
l'll see you later.

433
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:40,051
You Solenko?

434
00:39:40,492 --> 00:39:41,561
l'm Don Breedan.

435
00:39:41,652 --> 00:39:45,691
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

436
00:39:45,772 --> 00:39:47,922
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

437
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,650
l'm a great grill man.

438
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:51,131
Good. Good for you.

439
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:55,125
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

440
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:58,522
Give me a hard time, l'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

441
00:39:58,612 --> 00:40:00,409
l'll violate you back fast.

442
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:03,251
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

443
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:07,405
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

444
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:15,244
What are you waiting for?

445
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:35,844
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

446
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:37,411
Roger Van Zant.

447
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:38,607
<i>Please hold.</i>

448
00:40:42,172 --> 00:40:44,003
<i>This is Roger Van Zant.</i>

449
00:40:44,532 --> 00:40:46,045
l'm supposed to collect something.

450
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,166
Someone will call you back
from another line.

451
00:40:50,612 --> 00:40:52,807
818-133-6089.

452
00:41:17,572 --> 00:41:21,690
<i>I got a package for you. There's a drive-in</i>
<i>on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.</i>

453
00:41:21,892 --> 00:41:23,803
Just send one man, alone.

454
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,449
-Who was that guy?
-Nobody.

455
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:53,290
-Who was that guy?
-Nobody.

456
00:41:53,652 --> 00:41:55,529
l gotta know who he is! Who is he?

457
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:56,767
He's nobody, Neil.

458
00:41:56,852 --> 00:42:00,208
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

459
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:01,891
Chris will make up.

460
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:04,692
-lt's too late! l'm sick of it!
-Shut up!

461
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:09,329
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

462
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:13,246
After that, he fucks up,
then l will finance setting you up myself...

463
00:42:13,652 --> 00:42:15,722
...on my own, anywhere you want.

464
00:42:15,852 --> 00:42:17,490
Dominick will go with you.

465
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:19,882
And my word counts. But right now...

466
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:22,442
...you will give him the chance.

467
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:28,044
Clean up. Go home.

468
00:42:29,332 --> 00:42:30,924
Clean up. Go home!

469
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,366
Give me all your money.

470
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:18,408
You'll get smoked with that shit.

471
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:19,641
Won't be you.

472
00:43:22,692 --> 00:43:24,683
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

473
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:55,764
Vincent, hey, man.

474
00:43:58,852 --> 00:44:01,047
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

475
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,605
lt's all right.

476
00:44:03,772 --> 00:44:05,603
What have you got for me?

477
00:44:06,052 --> 00:44:10,364
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

478
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:14,208
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

479
00:44:14,332 --> 00:44:17,449
...if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

480
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:20,569
...they might find two Turbos
and a 91 1 Slope.

481
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:24,046
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

482
00:44:25,172 --> 00:44:26,810
l'm a good citizen.

483
00:44:26,892 --> 00:44:28,405
l'm Donald Duck.

484
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:30,489
You got something to tell me?

485
00:44:32,052 --> 00:44:33,770
Check this out, cuz.

486
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:37,809
How do l know if l tell you
what you need to know...

487
00:44:38,132 --> 00:44:41,363
...that you're gonna do
what the fuck l need to get done.

488
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,730
Hanna is straight up.

489
00:44:44,492 --> 00:44:46,687
l ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

490
00:44:46,772 --> 00:44:49,002
And you know because l say so...

491
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:52,291
...after l hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

492
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:53,327
Fuck you.

493
00:44:53,532 --> 00:44:54,760
You understand?

494
00:44:55,012 --> 00:44:56,923
l can get killed for telling you this.

495
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:59,162
You can get killed walking your doggie!

496
00:44:59,252 --> 00:45:00,526
All right, man...

497
00:45:01,052 --> 00:45:03,361
...there was a cat l was locked up with.

498
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:07,201
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. l ran into him.

499
00:45:10,452 --> 00:45:11,567
And so?

500
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:14,008
He's a big fiend for action.

501
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:18,127
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
l'd have thought nothing, but...

502
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:21,490
...he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

503
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:24,245
...and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

504
00:45:24,332 --> 00:45:26,243
Right then and there l know...

505
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:29,332
...this cat's got something going down.

506
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:38,244
Pretty fucking great.

507
00:45:39,892 --> 00:45:42,042
Albert, what's wrong with you?

508
00:45:42,732 --> 00:45:45,451
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

509
00:45:46,172 --> 00:45:48,766
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

510
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:50,207
That's right.

511
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,691
Well, l am...

512
00:45:51,892 --> 00:45:53,530
...over-fucking-whelmed.

513
00:45:53,892 --> 00:45:56,167
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

514
00:45:56,692 --> 00:45:58,967
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

515
00:45:59,812 --> 00:46:01,131
ls he kidding me?

516
00:46:02,452 --> 00:46:03,487
l'm telling you:

517
00:46:03,572 --> 00:46:04,846
This Slick is no joke.

518
00:46:05,492 --> 00:46:06,971
He's double time.

519
00:46:07,052 --> 00:46:08,246
Say what?

520
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,809
"Slick." What does that mean?

521
00:46:10,932 --> 00:46:13,287
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

522
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:16,404
Tell me about him.

523
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:20,329
About 6 feet tall...

524
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,483
...lots of jailhouse tats.

525
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,642
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

526
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:28,485
What's his name?

527
00:46:29,492 --> 00:46:30,686
Cheritto.

528
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:32,850
Michael Cheritto.

529
00:46:37,012 --> 00:46:39,128
<i>Thirty-three busts since 19</i>7<i>6.</i>

530
00:46:39,612 --> 00:46:42,080
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,</i>
<i>three convictions.</i>

531
00:46:42,212 --> 00:46:44,772
<i>Two out of a three-to-five year beef</i>
<i>in Attica.</i>

532
00:46:44,852 --> 00:46:46,001
Three years in Marion.

533
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:49,243
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

534
00:46:49,332 --> 00:46:50,560
<i>Jacket's two inches thick.</i>

535
00:46:50,652 --> 00:46:52,529
Who do l have there now?

536
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:55,246
-Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
-<i>Tell SIS...</i>

537
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:59,086
...l want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

538
00:46:59,172 --> 00:47:01,083
We never close. Open every day.

539
00:47:01,492 --> 00:47:03,244
<i>Bug the car, the house, the work.</i>

540
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:05,482
<i>When he moves or sits,</i>
<i>like in a restaurant...</i>

541
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,040
<i>...I want pictures of who he moves</i>
<i>and sits with.</i>

542
00:47:08,212 --> 00:47:11,409
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

543
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:14,081
l want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

544
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:09,408
Put your hands where l can see them.

545
00:48:09,612 --> 00:48:11,728
Put your hands where l can see them.

546
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,760
l tell you what to do.

547
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:15,644
l tell you how to do it.

548
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:19,722
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

549
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:23,647
...take the package and throw it in here.

550
00:48:41,012 --> 00:48:41,888
Behind you.

551
00:48:41,972 --> 00:48:42,927
<i>On the right.</i>

552
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:00,611
Roger Van Zant.

553
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:02,287
Who's this?

554
00:50:02,732 --> 00:50:04,165
You know who this is.

555
00:50:05,012 --> 00:50:06,286
Yes, l do.

556
00:50:06,772 --> 00:50:08,683
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

557
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,888
He didn't call. ls everything okay?

558
00:50:11,652 --> 00:50:13,802
<i>I tell you what, forget the money.</i>

559
00:50:14,332 --> 00:50:15,208
What?

560
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:17,644
Forget the money.

561
00:50:20,052 --> 00:50:23,965
lt's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

562
00:50:24,052 --> 00:50:26,850
What am l doing?
l'm talking to an empty telephone.

563
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,091
l don't understand.

564
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:32,684
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

565
00:50:53,012 --> 00:50:54,240
Do you like it?

566
00:50:54,332 --> 00:50:55,685
Look at my ring.

567
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,046
Did you know?

568
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:04,971
You are insane.

569
00:51:10,132 --> 00:51:11,087
Do you like it?

570
00:51:11,172 --> 00:51:13,083
-lt's beautiful.
-lt's good.

571
00:51:13,212 --> 00:51:15,089
Don't ask him where he got it.

572
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:25,767
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

573
00:51:26,092 --> 00:51:27,241
l don't know.

574
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:31,525
Just like me.

575
00:51:31,612 --> 00:51:33,091
l don't know either.

576
00:51:47,052 --> 00:51:48,087
Hello?

577
00:51:48,732 --> 00:51:49,926
lt's me.

578
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:53,563
l was wondering if you'd call.

579
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:56,406
l've been busy.

580
00:51:56,692 --> 00:51:57,966
Can l see you?

581
00:51:58,372 --> 00:52:00,203
l was afraid that was just...

582
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:02,605
...the one night.

583
00:52:03,692 --> 00:52:05,489
Not for me, it wasn't.

584
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,325
Yeah, me neither.

585
00:52:11,412 --> 00:52:12,845
Can l fall by?

586
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:15,201
Yeah.

587
00:52:15,412 --> 00:52:17,243
l'll see you in a little bit.

588
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,370
Goddamn convention.

589
00:52:34,572 --> 00:52:36,688
-Which one's Slick?
-The wide one.

590
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:38,610
We got two transmitters.

591
00:52:38,852 --> 00:52:41,525
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

592
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:42,567
Here we are.

593
00:52:42,652 --> 00:52:44,563
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

594
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,243
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

595
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,722
SlS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

596
00:52:53,132 --> 00:52:56,169
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

597
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:58,482
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

598
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:01,926
Sammy and l think that will be
their next score.

599
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,331
Who's the loner?

600
00:53:06,372 --> 00:53:07,805
First time we've seen him.

601
00:53:07,892 --> 00:53:09,405
We're not on him yet.

602
00:53:11,452 --> 00:53:12,726
Get on it.

603
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:34,328
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

604
00:53:36,172 --> 00:53:39,209
...they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

605
00:53:54,292 --> 00:53:55,884
Baby, time to go.

606
00:53:57,412 --> 00:53:59,721
Showed you a good time, didn't l?

607
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:04,207
You fly.

608
00:54:04,372 --> 00:54:05,600
You're cool.

609
00:54:12,892 --> 00:54:16,487
You're lying to me.
l can always tell when people lie to me.

610
00:54:17,332 --> 00:54:18,606
l ain't lying.

611
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:20,725
You're a hot dog.

612
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:23,084
A regular rodeo rider.

613
00:54:23,732 --> 00:54:26,644
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

614
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:33,645
Now, l got to get my ass street-side, sugar.

615
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,882
You don't have a truth-telling style.

616
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:37,804
What are you talking about?

617
00:54:37,972 --> 00:54:40,008
You don't know what this is.

618
00:54:46,252 --> 00:54:48,641
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

619
00:55:06,772 --> 00:55:08,091
Where have you been?

620
00:55:09,452 --> 00:55:11,090
SHU at Pelican Bay.

621
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:13,084
Folsom, B-wing.

622
00:55:14,092 --> 00:55:15,605
l am a cowboy...

623
00:55:16,252 --> 00:55:18,083
...looking for anything heavy.

624
00:55:18,172 --> 00:55:20,208
Billy said to come see you.

625
00:55:20,892 --> 00:55:22,689
That is why l am here.

626
00:55:31,452 --> 00:55:33,488
Why don't you call this guy?

627
00:55:34,892 --> 00:55:37,042
This guy's always putting guys on.

628
00:55:41,052 --> 00:55:42,087
Thank you.

629
00:55:55,892 --> 00:55:57,689
You're perfect for each other.

630
00:56:03,252 --> 00:56:05,083
l knew a guy in grade school.

631
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:07,528
His name was Raoul...whatever.

632
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:11,168
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

633
00:56:11,412 --> 00:56:13,403
He'd turn his eyelids inside out....

634
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:16,370
l can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

635
00:56:17,812 --> 00:56:20,372
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

636
00:56:20,452 --> 00:56:22,044
...bestial sort of way.

637
00:56:26,532 --> 00:56:27,601
Woman.

638
00:56:34,132 --> 00:56:36,043
This better be earth-shattering.

639
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:43,965
This is to Raoul.

640
00:56:46,212 --> 00:56:47,804
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

641
00:57:28,372 --> 00:57:30,124
Here's how we found her.

642
00:57:34,252 --> 00:57:35,082
How old?

643
00:57:35,172 --> 00:57:37,732
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

644
00:57:38,892 --> 00:57:40,291
How'd she die?

645
00:57:40,372 --> 00:57:43,648
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

646
00:57:46,412 --> 00:57:47,527
Who's that?

647
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:49,280
Mother and siblings.

648
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:51,124
-Why are they here?
-lt's fucked up.

649
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:54,010
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

650
00:57:55,092 --> 00:57:56,207
Let's go.

651
00:58:00,772 --> 00:58:01,807
Nice.

652
00:58:02,692 --> 00:58:06,526
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

653
00:58:06,612 --> 00:58:09,570
...so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

654
00:58:09,892 --> 00:58:11,405
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

655
00:58:11,492 --> 00:58:12,686
Not yet.

656
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:15,405
Get off of me!

657
00:58:18,212 --> 00:58:19,406
Oh, my God!

658
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:24,721
Where is she?

659
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:26,525
Easy, easy, easy.

660
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:31,085
Please, come on.

661
00:58:33,852 --> 00:58:35,649
lt's okay.

662
00:58:36,852 --> 00:58:38,285
Where is my baby?

663
00:58:38,452 --> 00:58:39,567
Where is she?

664
00:58:40,372 --> 00:58:42,488
l need to know what happened.

665
00:59:22,972 --> 00:59:25,008
l guess the earth shattered.

666
00:59:25,772 --> 00:59:28,445
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:32,487
l didn't want to ruin their night too.

668
00:59:32,892 --> 00:59:34,166
What was it?

669
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,605
You don't want to know.

670
00:59:37,692 --> 00:59:40,764
l'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
00:59:40,892 --> 00:59:43,247
l don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

672
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:46,287
You never told me l'd be excluded.

673
00:59:48,252 --> 00:59:50,163
l told you when we hooked up...

674
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:52,402
...that you'd have to share me...

675
00:59:52,492 --> 00:59:56,087
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
00:59:56,252 --> 00:59:58,322
And l bought into that sharing...

677
00:59:58,612 --> 01:00:00,170
...because l love you.

678
01:00:00,572 --> 01:00:04,167
l love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

679
01:00:04,292 --> 01:00:05,441
l don't care.

680
01:00:06,572 --> 01:00:09,211
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

681
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:12,204
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

682
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:14,846
What l should do is come home and say:

683
01:00:15,692 --> 01:00:19,048
"Hi, honey, guess what?
l walked into this house today...

684
01:00:19,132 --> 01:00:23,011
"...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

685
01:00:23,092 --> 01:00:26,448
"...because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

686
01:00:26,532 --> 01:00:29,251
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

687
01:00:29,452 --> 01:00:33,809
"...we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

688
01:00:34,412 --> 01:00:35,288
Right?

689
01:00:37,772 --> 01:00:38,727
Wrong.

690
01:00:39,012 --> 01:00:40,127
You know why?

691
01:00:40,212 --> 01:00:42,407
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:00:43,252 --> 01:00:44,605
We fuck and you don't speak.

693
01:00:44,692 --> 01:00:46,762
'Cause l got to hold on to my angst.

694
01:00:47,372 --> 01:00:48,725
l preserve it...

695
01:00:48,892 --> 01:00:52,123
...because l need it.
lt keeps me sharp, on the edge.

696
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:53,846
Where l gotta be.

697
01:01:00,892 --> 01:01:02,564
You don't live with me.

698
01:01:05,012 --> 01:01:07,572
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:13,488
You sift through the detritus.

700
01:01:14,812 --> 01:01:16,530
You read the terrain.

701
01:01:17,772 --> 01:01:20,081
You search for signs of passing...

702
01:01:20,732 --> 01:01:22,688
...for the scent of your prey...

703
01:01:22,772 --> 01:01:24,683
...and then you hunt them down.

704
01:01:26,252 --> 01:01:28,846
That's the only thing you're committed to.

705
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:34,845
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

706
01:01:39,932 --> 01:01:43,242
What l don't understand is
why l can't cut loose of you.

707
01:02:02,172 --> 01:02:03,651
Let's go, baby.

708
01:02:06,332 --> 01:02:07,924
l met the manager.

709
01:02:08,332 --> 01:02:09,765
ls that the boss?

710
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:13,645
l did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

711
01:02:14,012 --> 01:02:17,322
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

712
01:02:18,332 --> 01:02:19,890
Can you do that?

713
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:24,685
Ain't a hard time been invented
that l cannot handle.

714
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:32,369
Why're you hanging with me?

715
01:02:34,132 --> 01:02:35,929
Because l'm proud of you.

716
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:43,011
You're proud of me?

717
01:02:47,772 --> 01:02:49,808
Why the hell are you proud of me?

718
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:52,645
Come on home.

719
01:03:03,052 --> 01:03:04,690
What were you doing there?

720
01:03:04,892 --> 01:03:06,291
l was skiing.

721
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:08,210
l was trying to ski.

722
01:03:08,972 --> 01:03:11,805
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

723
01:03:12,572 --> 01:03:14,324
...and you meet people.

724
01:03:14,652 --> 01:03:16,165
You try to have a good time.

725
01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:17,844
-Did you have a good time?
-No.

726
01:03:17,932 --> 01:03:19,047
Why not?

727
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:21,283
l'm not good at meeting people.

728
01:03:21,692 --> 01:03:23,011
You met me.

729
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:26,121
That happened without my thinking
about it.

730
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:28,403
Which is why l probably....

731
01:03:29,012 --> 01:03:31,003
No, it's because you are fine.

732
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:38,003
Take off with me for a while.

733
01:03:39,372 --> 01:03:40,248
Where?

734
01:03:40,852 --> 01:03:42,171
New Zealand.

735
01:03:43,412 --> 01:03:44,481
When?

736
01:03:46,092 --> 01:03:48,560
l have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

737
01:03:49,052 --> 01:03:50,485
But my job....

738
01:03:50,572 --> 01:03:52,642
l got money. You don't need money.

739
01:03:52,732 --> 01:03:55,087
You could set up a studio and work there.

740
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:56,647
l don't know.

741
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,211
What's there to know?

742
01:03:58,332 --> 01:03:59,765
Are you married?

743
01:04:01,292 --> 01:04:02,327
What?

744
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:04,483
The last thing l am is married.

745
01:04:04,652 --> 01:04:07,450
l'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

746
01:04:07,612 --> 01:04:09,250
Then, all of a sudden...

747
01:04:10,132 --> 01:04:12,088
...someone like you comes along.

748
01:04:15,612 --> 01:04:16,522
You don't know me.

749
01:04:16,612 --> 01:04:18,045
l know enough.

750
01:04:21,852 --> 01:04:23,205
Come with me.

751
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:34,091
What's wrong?

752
01:04:35,772 --> 01:04:38,491
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

753
01:04:43,252 --> 01:04:44,241
Yeah.

754
01:04:47,852 --> 01:04:48,807
Good.

755
01:05:12,732 --> 01:05:14,085
Hi, sweetie.

756
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,801
You forget your mom was picking you up?

757
01:05:19,412 --> 01:05:20,367
No.

758
01:05:22,412 --> 01:05:24,084
So, what's going on?

759
01:05:25,852 --> 01:05:27,524
l felt like being alone.

760
01:05:30,332 --> 01:05:32,163
Come on, l'll drive you home.

761
01:06:26,612 --> 01:06:27,727
What's happening?

762
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:30,528
Sir.

763
01:06:30,612 --> 01:06:33,172
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

764
01:06:33,652 --> 01:06:36,007
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

765
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:29,320
Technique.

766
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:49,963
Open Sesame. Right there.

767
01:08:45,372 --> 01:08:46,725
There he is.

768
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:47,563
We walk!

769
01:09:47,652 --> 01:09:48,448
l'm there.

770
01:09:48,532 --> 01:09:49,647
We walk! Now!

771
01:10:04,172 --> 01:10:05,446
He's heard it.

772
01:10:13,492 --> 01:10:14,447
Heads up.

773
01:10:16,332 --> 01:10:18,368
-One's coming out.
-Hold it, Captain.

774
01:10:18,452 --> 01:10:20,602
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

775
01:10:20,892 --> 01:10:21,802
l see.

776
01:10:24,932 --> 01:10:27,127
-Here we go.
-Not till my boss says so.

777
01:10:27,212 --> 01:10:29,487
Both of them are not carrying anything.

778
01:10:38,212 --> 01:10:39,804
-Let them go.
-<i>What do you mean?</i>

779
01:10:39,892 --> 01:10:40,927
<i>We can take them</i>--

780
01:10:41,012 --> 01:10:42,081
On what?

781
01:10:42,412 --> 01:10:44,164
They didn't steal anything yet.

782
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:48,764
lt gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

783
01:10:49,052 --> 01:10:50,121
No fucking way.

784
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:53,329
l'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

785
01:10:53,412 --> 01:10:56,848
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

786
01:10:56,932 --> 01:10:59,605
l have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

787
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:02,729
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

788
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:48,131
Back to work.

789
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,487
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

790
01:11:54,052 --> 01:11:56,930
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

791
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:59,401
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

792
01:11:59,572 --> 01:12:03,531
Assume they got our phones, our houses.
Assume they got us right here, right now...

793
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:06,001
...as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:08,443
How will we buy the bank package?

795
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,011
l'll front that.

796
01:12:10,132 --> 01:12:11,770
What about Van Zant?

797
01:12:11,972 --> 01:12:15,851
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War ll on the streets with Van Zant?

798
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,331
No, l want my 750.

799
01:12:17,892 --> 01:12:21,965
l got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

800
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:24,612
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

801
01:12:24,692 --> 01:12:26,808
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

802
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:31,484
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

803
01:12:36,372 --> 01:12:38,283
The bank is worth the risk.

804
01:12:38,492 --> 01:12:39,925
l need it, brother.

805
01:12:41,492 --> 01:12:44,564
We should stay and take it down.
That's where l come out.

806
01:12:55,132 --> 01:12:57,168
l roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

807
01:12:57,652 --> 01:12:59,165
-Whatever.
-Not on this one.

808
01:12:59,412 --> 01:13:01,323
On this one, you're on your own.

809
01:13:13,732 --> 01:13:16,041
You figure this is the best thing to do?

810
01:13:16,212 --> 01:13:18,282
This is the best thing to do?

811
01:13:18,652 --> 01:13:22,042
l've got plans, l'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

812
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:25,090
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

813
01:13:25,172 --> 01:13:27,242
You got T-bonds, real estate.

814
01:13:27,372 --> 01:13:30,091
lf l were you, l would be smart
and cut loose of this.

815
01:13:47,572 --> 01:13:48,800
For me...

816
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:51,003
...the action is the juice.

817
01:13:51,612 --> 01:13:52,522
l'm in.

818
01:13:58,292 --> 01:13:59,566
Yeah, sure.

819
01:13:59,732 --> 01:14:00,801
Let's go.

820
01:14:01,572 --> 01:14:03,324
Fuck them, let's do it.

821
01:14:03,492 --> 01:14:05,687
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

822
01:14:22,292 --> 01:14:24,044
Tim, l gotta call you back.

823
01:14:24,372 --> 01:14:26,647
-Can l help you?
-Are you Alan Marciano?

824
01:14:26,852 --> 01:14:28,126
Who the fuck are you?

825
01:14:28,212 --> 01:14:29,327
Who am l?

826
01:14:30,012 --> 01:14:32,128
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

827
01:14:32,212 --> 01:14:35,522
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

828
01:14:36,892 --> 01:14:40,328
Do you know who you're pushing around?
l know people here.

829
01:14:40,532 --> 01:14:42,921
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

830
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:48,765
You are extradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

831
01:14:48,852 --> 01:14:50,968
...up from North Carolina three years ago...

832
01:14:51,052 --> 01:14:52,963
...or you go to work for us.

833
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:54,765
Cut and dried.

834
01:14:55,172 --> 01:14:56,491
That is it.

835
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:57,807
Shit.

836
01:14:58,772 --> 01:15:00,410
Charlene Shiherlis.

837
01:15:00,892 --> 01:15:01,688
Who?

838
01:15:01,852 --> 01:15:02,682
Who?

839
01:15:03,092 --> 01:15:04,844
What are you, a fucking owl?

840
01:15:04,972 --> 01:15:08,726
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

841
01:15:09,132 --> 01:15:10,724
You can't tie me to her.

842
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:14,925
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

843
01:15:17,132 --> 01:15:18,724
Why did l get mixed up with her?

844
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:21,167
Because she's got a great ass!

845
01:15:22,892 --> 01:15:25,486
And you got your head all the way up it.

846
01:15:26,572 --> 01:15:27,527
Jesus.

847
01:15:28,092 --> 01:15:29,525
Ferocious, aren't l?

848
01:15:29,932 --> 01:15:31,650
When l think of asses...

849
01:15:31,732 --> 01:15:33,165
...a woman's ass...

850
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:35,523
...something comes out of me.

851
01:15:36,972 --> 01:15:37,563
So?

852
01:15:37,652 --> 01:15:38,971
So, no big thing.

853
01:15:39,892 --> 01:15:41,325
All l want...

854
01:15:41,652 --> 01:15:44,212
...is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:15:44,852 --> 01:15:46,570
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

856
01:15:50,892 --> 01:15:53,122
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

857
01:15:53,492 --> 01:15:56,325
...that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:15:56,412 --> 01:15:57,367
Right.

859
01:15:57,612 --> 01:16:00,046
The security systems around here
are a joke.

860
01:16:04,692 --> 01:16:07,411
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

861
01:16:08,332 --> 01:16:09,287
No. 2:

862
01:16:09,372 --> 01:16:11,249
<i>Over here. Anaheim to the 1 10.</i>

863
01:16:11,812 --> 01:16:12,688
Good.

864
01:16:13,132 --> 01:16:13,962
You got it?

865
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:15,405
Good. Let's go.

866
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:38,645
They were looking back...

867
01:16:40,052 --> 01:16:41,531
...in this direction.

868
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:43,964
A container facility?

869
01:16:44,052 --> 01:16:45,531
What? Cartage theft?

870
01:16:45,612 --> 01:16:47,523
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

871
01:16:52,212 --> 01:16:54,362
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

872
01:16:54,452 --> 01:16:55,771
Refinery only pays by check.

873
01:16:55,852 --> 01:16:57,080
No cash around.

874
01:16:57,372 --> 01:16:58,885
Same for the scrap yard.

875
01:17:02,252 --> 01:17:03,526
Stealing hubcaps?

876
01:17:07,492 --> 01:17:09,528
A refinery and a scrap yard.

877
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,445
What the hell is going on?

878
01:17:12,532 --> 01:17:14,568
That's what we are trying to figure out.

879
01:17:15,372 --> 01:17:17,090
We thought we had it.

880
01:17:17,812 --> 01:17:19,086
Thought we had it.

881
01:17:28,372 --> 01:17:29,885
l got an idea...

882
01:17:30,772 --> 01:17:32,649
...on what they were looking at.

883
01:17:36,172 --> 01:17:38,322
Want to know what they're looking at?

884
01:17:40,052 --> 01:17:42,850
l mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

885
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:45,884
This crew is good.

886
01:17:48,292 --> 01:17:49,884
Know what they're looking at?

887
01:17:50,772 --> 01:17:51,807
What?

888
01:17:53,132 --> 01:17:54,121
Us.

889
01:17:55,492 --> 01:17:56,686
The LAPD.

890
01:17:57,492 --> 01:17:59,289
The police department.

891
01:18:00,572 --> 01:18:02,005
We just got made.

892
01:18:09,772 --> 01:18:10,807
Yeah!

893
01:18:19,012 --> 01:18:20,047
Okay!

894
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:30,805
Okay, motherfucker!

895
01:18:50,854 --> 01:18:52,287
Kelso come through?

896
01:18:52,614 --> 01:18:55,003
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

897
01:19:00,774 --> 01:19:02,173
Name is Hanna.

898
01:19:02,454 --> 01:19:03,887
First name, Vincent.

899
01:19:04,454 --> 01:19:06,365
l smeared this sergeant five yards.

900
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:07,933
Hanna's all over you.

901
01:19:08,694 --> 01:19:11,333
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

902
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,723
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.

903
01:19:13,814 --> 01:19:15,042
He's a hot dog.

904
01:19:15,294 --> 01:19:17,489
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

905
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:19,806
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

906
01:19:19,894 --> 01:19:23,330
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

907
01:19:23,414 --> 01:19:25,006
He was a fucking maniac.

908
01:19:25,814 --> 01:19:27,964
He was working Narcotics before that.

909
01:19:28,454 --> 01:19:30,729
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

910
01:19:30,814 --> 01:19:32,406
He's why the extra heat.

911
01:19:35,094 --> 01:19:36,686
The vice sergeant...

912
01:19:37,974 --> 01:19:39,805
...says Hanna likes you...

913
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:44,044
...thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

914
01:19:44,134 --> 01:19:46,523
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

915
01:19:48,854 --> 01:19:50,287
Funny as a heart attack.

916
01:19:50,374 --> 01:19:53,764
Three marriages? Do you think that means
he likes staying home?

917
01:19:54,454 --> 01:19:56,809
Means he's one of those guys out there...

918
01:19:57,014 --> 01:19:59,608
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

919
01:20:01,854 --> 01:20:04,209
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

920
01:20:11,214 --> 01:20:12,772
lt's worth the stretch.

921
01:20:13,694 --> 01:20:15,605
This guy can hit or miss.

922
01:20:16,054 --> 01:20:17,646
You can't miss once.

923
01:20:18,414 --> 01:20:19,529
You sure?

924
01:20:20,614 --> 01:20:21,888
l am sure.

925
01:20:27,454 --> 01:20:28,887
Let's go to the garage.

926
01:20:56,334 --> 01:20:57,733
Where are we going?

927
01:21:02,654 --> 01:21:04,087
Where are you going?

928
01:21:04,574 --> 01:21:05,563
Out.

929
01:22:01,854 --> 01:22:02,843
What are they on?

930
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:04,128
<i>TAC 9.</i>

931
01:22:05,934 --> 01:22:09,722
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.</i>
<i>We got four ground units.</i>

932
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:30,293
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have l got?

933
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:32,565
<i>This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.</i>

934
01:22:32,734 --> 01:22:36,044
<i>Richard Glover's with me.</i>
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound...</i>

935
01:22:36,414 --> 01:22:38,086
<i>...approaching the 1 10.</i>

936
01:22:38,974 --> 01:22:40,248
Revolving tail?

937
01:22:40,534 --> 01:22:43,002
<i>I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

938
01:22:43,294 --> 01:22:46,411
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

939
01:22:47,334 --> 01:22:48,562
Let's go.

940
01:23:36,574 --> 01:23:40,089
Am l 100 yards, or what?
Am l close or far, or what?

941
01:23:40,534 --> 01:23:42,490
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

942
01:24:46,894 --> 01:24:48,168
How're you doing?

943
01:24:51,694 --> 01:24:54,254
What do you say l buy you a cup of coffee?

944
01:25:00,454 --> 01:25:01,728
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

945
01:25:02,454 --> 01:25:03,648
Follow me.

946
01:25:18,814 --> 01:25:20,566
Seven years in Folsom.

947
01:25:21,294 --> 01:25:23,046
ln the hole for three.

948
01:25:23,174 --> 01:25:24,573
McNeil before that.

949
01:25:27,774 --> 01:25:29,685
McNeil as tough as they say?

950
01:25:30,854 --> 01:25:32,765
You looking to become a penologist?

951
01:25:33,934 --> 01:25:35,526
You looking to go back?

952
01:25:35,774 --> 01:25:39,653
l chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

953
01:25:39,814 --> 01:25:40,883
That you?

954
01:25:42,014 --> 01:25:44,244
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

955
01:25:44,934 --> 01:25:46,606
l worked all kinds.

956
01:25:49,814 --> 01:25:53,602
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

957
01:25:54,814 --> 01:25:55,769
l do not.

958
01:25:56,294 --> 01:25:57,249
Right.

959
01:25:58,774 --> 01:26:00,526
l am never going back.

960
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:04,170
Then don't take down scores.

961
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:06,966
l do what l do best:

962
01:26:07,134 --> 01:26:10,922
l take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

963
01:26:14,654 --> 01:26:16,804
You never wanted a regular-type life?

964
01:26:17,534 --> 01:26:20,128
What is that? Barbecues and ball games?

965
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:23,010
Yeah.

966
01:26:25,374 --> 01:26:27,365
This regular-type life like your life?

967
01:26:28,054 --> 01:26:29,965
My life? No, my life....

968
01:26:31,614 --> 01:26:33,252
My life's a disaster zone.

969
01:26:35,014 --> 01:26:37,448
l got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

970
01:26:37,974 --> 01:26:40,932
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

971
01:26:41,014 --> 01:26:42,242
l got a wife.

972
01:26:42,334 --> 01:26:44,973
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

973
01:26:45,054 --> 01:26:46,089
My third.

974
01:26:48,094 --> 01:26:51,689
Because l spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

975
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,048
That's my life.

976
01:26:59,294 --> 01:27:01,012
A guy told me one time:

977
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:06,966
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

978
01:27:07,054 --> 01:27:09,409
"...if you feel the heat around the corner."

979
01:27:10,814 --> 01:27:13,886
lf you're on me and you got to move
when l move...

980
01:27:14,254 --> 01:27:16,893
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

981
01:27:18,934 --> 01:27:20,686
That's an interesting point.

982
01:27:22,174 --> 01:27:23,323
Are you a monk?

983
01:27:24,654 --> 01:27:25,848
l have a woman.

984
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,807
What do you tell her?

985
01:27:30,134 --> 01:27:31,772
l tell her l'm a salesman.

986
01:27:38,294 --> 01:27:41,206
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

987
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:44,005
...you'll just walk out on her?

988
01:27:45,494 --> 01:27:47,052
Not say good-bye?

989
01:27:47,774 --> 01:27:49,366
That's the discipline.

990
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:51,926
That's pretty vacant.

991
01:27:52,094 --> 01:27:53,686
lt is what it is.

992
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:56,447
lt's that, or we both better go
do something else.

993
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:00,285
l don't know how to do anything else.

994
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:02,133
Neither do l.

995
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:06,327
l don't want to either.

996
01:28:07,054 --> 01:28:08,203
Neither do l.

997
01:28:15,574 --> 01:28:18,088
You know, l have this recurring dream.

998
01:28:19,894 --> 01:28:22,727
l'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

999
01:28:22,814 --> 01:28:26,250
...all the victims of all the murders
l ever worked are there...

1000
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:29,804
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

1001
01:28:30,734 --> 01:28:34,522
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

1002
01:28:35,734 --> 01:28:38,646
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

1003
01:28:39,134 --> 01:28:42,410
...because l found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

1004
01:28:43,134 --> 01:28:45,523
The neighbors reported the smell...

1005
01:28:46,454 --> 01:28:48,012
...and there they are...

1006
01:28:48,094 --> 01:28:49,766
...all just sitting there.

1007
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:53,043
What do they say?

1008
01:28:54,974 --> 01:28:55,929
Nothing.

1009
01:28:56,374 --> 01:28:57,523
No talk?

1010
01:28:59,614 --> 01:29:01,332
They have nothing to say.

1011
01:29:02,174 --> 01:29:04,085
We just look at each other.

1012
01:29:05,014 --> 01:29:06,606
They look at me...

1013
01:29:07,094 --> 01:29:09,164
...and that's it. That's the dream.

1014
01:29:11,894 --> 01:29:13,691
l have one where l'm drowning.

1015
01:29:14,414 --> 01:29:17,929
l gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or l'll die in my sleep.

1016
01:29:19,934 --> 01:29:21,253
Know what that's about?

1017
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:24,213
Having enough time.

1018
01:29:25,814 --> 01:29:26,963
Enough time...

1019
01:29:27,374 --> 01:29:29,046
...to do what you want to do?

1020
01:29:29,214 --> 01:29:30,442
That's right.

1021
01:29:32,854 --> 01:29:34,173
You doing it now?

1022
01:29:34,334 --> 01:29:35,528
No, not yet.

1023
01:29:40,894 --> 01:29:42,805
You know, we're sitting here...

1024
01:29:44,094 --> 01:29:46,244
...like a couple of regular fellas.

1025
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,803
You do what you do,
and l do what l gotta do.

1026
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:53,369
Now that we've been face to face...

1027
01:29:56,214 --> 01:29:58,774
...if l'm there and l gotta put you away...

1028
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:00,527
...l won't like it.

1029
01:30:01,334 --> 01:30:02,449
But, l tell you...

1030
01:30:04,894 --> 01:30:06,805
...if it's between you...

1031
01:30:06,974 --> 01:30:10,649
...and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

1032
01:30:11,574 --> 01:30:12,723
...brother...

1033
01:30:13,174 --> 01:30:14,971
...you are going down.

1034
01:30:26,974 --> 01:30:29,204
There's a flip side to that coin.

1035
01:30:31,414 --> 01:30:33,530
What if you do got me boxed in...

1036
01:30:33,934 --> 01:30:35,652
...and l gotta put you down?

1037
01:30:36,734 --> 01:30:38,406
Because no matter what...

1038
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,845
...you won't get in my way.

1039
01:30:42,014 --> 01:30:44,164
We've been face to face, yeah.

1040
01:30:47,334 --> 01:30:49,006
But l will not hesitate.

1041
01:30:49,334 --> 01:30:50,653
Not for a second.

1042
01:30:56,814 --> 01:30:58,247
Maybe that'll happen.

1043
01:31:00,854 --> 01:31:01,843
Or...

1044
01:31:02,174 --> 01:31:03,448
...who knows?

1045
01:31:04,054 --> 01:31:06,329
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1046
01:31:21,614 --> 01:31:23,093
They dumped us.

1047
01:31:24,294 --> 01:31:25,124
What?

1048
01:31:25,734 --> 01:31:27,167
They dumped us.

1049
01:31:27,734 --> 01:31:28,928
What do you mean?

1050
01:31:29,014 --> 01:31:30,129
Chris slipped away.

1051
01:31:30,254 --> 01:31:32,165
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1052
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:35,485
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. l just tried.

1053
01:31:35,814 --> 01:31:37,725
-What about Cheritto?
-Same.

1054
01:31:37,814 --> 01:31:40,374
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

1055
01:31:42,934 --> 01:31:44,686
They dumped all our surveillance?

1056
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:46,924
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1057
01:31:48,094 --> 01:31:51,211
l had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1058
01:31:51,414 --> 01:31:52,324
We were on you.

1059
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:55,929
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

1060
01:31:56,854 --> 01:31:59,163
His car's still there. He's gone.

1061
01:32:04,374 --> 01:32:08,731
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

1062
01:33:06,094 --> 01:33:07,049
Hear from him?

1063
01:33:07,974 --> 01:33:11,808
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1064
01:33:14,334 --> 01:33:15,210
This guy...

1065
01:33:15,294 --> 01:33:16,647
...we put him on.

1066
01:33:16,814 --> 01:33:18,406
Says he knows McCauley.

1067
01:33:23,894 --> 01:33:24,770
Who are you?

1068
01:33:26,014 --> 01:33:27,163
Waingro.

1069
01:33:27,694 --> 01:33:29,286
My name's Waingro.

1070
01:33:29,614 --> 01:33:32,686
l've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

1071
01:33:34,014 --> 01:33:36,403
We took some major scores together.

1072
01:33:40,174 --> 01:33:42,005
Why haven't l heard from him?

1073
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:44,165
He's probably busy right now.

1074
01:33:44,494 --> 01:33:46,086
But he's real thorough.

1075
01:33:47,374 --> 01:33:49,444
He ain't going to forget about you.

1076
01:33:49,734 --> 01:33:51,087
That's reassuring.

1077
01:33:52,814 --> 01:33:55,203
l got some moves l could make here.

1078
01:33:56,334 --> 01:33:58,484
Probably be a big help to you.

1079
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:20,646
You recognize the grill man?

1080
01:34:28,334 --> 01:34:28,971
No.

1081
01:34:29,054 --> 01:34:29,850
Folsom.

1082
01:34:30,014 --> 01:34:32,289
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1083
01:34:33,854 --> 01:34:35,287
l ain't got my break yet.

1084
01:34:35,374 --> 01:34:37,490
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1085
01:34:37,694 --> 01:34:40,254
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1086
01:34:40,694 --> 01:34:42,173
Take your break later.

1087
01:34:42,654 --> 01:34:44,087
Piece of shit.

1088
01:34:44,294 --> 01:34:45,409
Pick up!

1089
01:34:48,574 --> 01:34:50,007
Where the hell is he?

1090
01:34:50,174 --> 01:34:52,483
l want to check the slot for the work car.

1091
01:34:52,574 --> 01:34:53,529
So did l.

1092
01:35:01,134 --> 01:35:02,089
Hang on.

1093
01:35:04,974 --> 01:35:08,250
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1094
01:35:21,214 --> 01:35:22,488
Where are you?

1095
01:35:22,574 --> 01:35:25,213
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

1096
01:35:25,694 --> 01:35:27,013
l can't dump them.

1097
01:35:29,534 --> 01:35:31,126
They know you see them?

1098
01:35:31,534 --> 01:35:33,365
They're doing parallels.

1099
01:35:35,934 --> 01:35:37,447
l can try to dump them again.

1100
01:35:37,534 --> 01:35:39,604
<i>How are we going to know if you did?</i>

1101
01:35:39,694 --> 01:35:41,286
lf not, you'll draw them to us.

1102
01:35:41,774 --> 01:35:42,729
Go to Ventura.

1103
01:35:42,814 --> 01:35:44,088
<i>Pull them out of here.</i>

1104
01:35:44,174 --> 01:35:47,484
l'm sorry. Last thing l wanted to do
was let you down.

1105
01:36:12,974 --> 01:36:13,724
Pick up.

1106
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:17,853
Neil, man. What's up?

1107
01:36:18,014 --> 01:36:19,049
What's up?

1108
01:36:19,134 --> 01:36:20,806
What are you doing here?

1109
01:36:21,054 --> 01:36:24,444
l'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

1110
01:36:24,534 --> 01:36:25,808
Right now, today.

1111
01:36:26,094 --> 01:36:27,368
You remember the drill?

1112
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:28,682
Yeah, sure.

1113
01:36:28,854 --> 01:36:29,969
You cool?

1114
01:36:30,654 --> 01:36:32,246
You know l'm cool.

1115
01:36:32,974 --> 01:36:35,283
One answer: yes or no. Right now.

1116
01:36:48,894 --> 01:36:51,613
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1117
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:54,487
Out back in five.

1118
01:37:04,414 --> 01:37:05,767
What's burning?

1119
01:37:06,254 --> 01:37:07,448
What is this?

1120
01:37:08,174 --> 01:37:10,130
Where do you think you're going?

1121
01:38:42,294 --> 01:38:44,285
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1122
01:38:44,414 --> 01:38:45,449
Hands up!

1123
01:38:45,534 --> 01:38:47,126
Put them up! Now!

1124
01:38:48,574 --> 01:38:49,450
Get on your knees!

1125
01:38:49,534 --> 01:38:50,489
The keys!

1126
01:38:51,534 --> 01:38:52,967
Get on your knees!

1127
01:38:57,054 --> 01:38:58,169
Get over there!

1128
01:38:59,894 --> 01:39:00,644
Turn around!

1129
01:39:00,734 --> 01:39:02,372
Put your hands behind you!

1130
01:39:02,454 --> 01:39:03,364
Get down!

1131
01:39:03,454 --> 01:39:04,489
Stay down!

1132
01:39:05,454 --> 01:39:06,284
Get down!

1133
01:39:09,094 --> 01:39:11,005
-Down!
-The keys! The keys!

1134
01:39:16,094 --> 01:39:17,049
Stay down!

1135
01:39:17,854 --> 01:39:20,766
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

1136
01:39:20,854 --> 01:39:23,732
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

1137
01:39:23,814 --> 01:39:25,327
Think of your families.

1138
01:39:25,414 --> 01:39:27,211
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1139
01:39:28,014 --> 01:39:32,087
l want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1140
01:39:32,454 --> 01:39:34,922
...anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

1141
01:39:36,254 --> 01:39:37,164
The key.

1142
01:39:37,414 --> 01:39:38,642
What key?

1143
01:39:40,494 --> 01:39:42,325
Sit down and stay down!

1144
01:39:43,454 --> 01:39:46,014
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1145
01:40:33,374 --> 01:40:35,285
Get down. Down, down, down.

1146
01:40:35,374 --> 01:40:36,807
Put your heads down!

1147
01:41:01,294 --> 01:41:03,649
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1148
01:41:03,734 --> 01:41:06,294
This C.l., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

1149
01:41:09,774 --> 01:41:11,924
Far East National Bank, 1 1:30!

01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:31,569

1151

...and l want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1152
01:42:11,294 --> 01:42:13,012
They're already coming out.

1153
01:42:13,534 --> 01:42:15,525
We gotta take them in the car.

1154
01:42:15,654 --> 01:42:17,406
Wait till they are all in.

1155
01:42:17,614 --> 01:42:19,730
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1156
01:42:28,974 --> 01:42:30,327
Police! Move!

1157
01:42:31,694 --> 01:42:33,047
Move. Move. Get down.

1158
01:42:54,254 --> 01:42:55,573
Move it. Down, down.

1159
01:42:59,094 --> 01:43:00,243
We did it!

1160
01:43:04,334 --> 01:43:05,369
Move!

1161
01:43:11,374 --> 01:43:12,568

01:43:21,694 --> 01:43:22,649
Get in the car!

1163
01:43:39,054 --> 01:43:40,248
Go! Go!

1164
01:44:38,334 --> 01:44:39,289
Go!

1165
01:45:03,294 --> 01:45:04,090
Go!

1166
01:46:41,134 --> 01:46:42,089
Come on!

1167
01:47:13,774 --> 01:47:15,048
Get down!

1168
01:47:27,854 --> 01:47:30,812
All the way down! Get down! Now!

1169
01:48:29,054 --> 01:48:30,328
Come here.

1170
01:49:13,974 --> 01:49:15,248
l got you.

1171
01:49:19,214 --> 01:49:23,605
<i>Tragedy in the neighborhood today.</i>
<i>A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.</i>

<i>This afternoon, a neighborhood was</i>
<i>terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1174
01:49:31,054 --> 01:49:34,729
<i>With the streets full of shoppers and kids,</i>
<i>police and armed robbers....</i>

1175
01:49:34,814 --> 01:49:36,213
Excuse me, bartender.

1176
01:49:36,294 --> 01:49:39,764
<i>Our top story tonight:</i>
<i>Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

1177
01:49:40,094 --> 01:49:43,131
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken</i>
<i>by a bank robbery...</i>

1178
01:49:43,294 --> 01:49:45,649
<i>...that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

1179
01:49:45,894 --> 01:49:47,213
<i>Michael Cheritto...</i>

1180
01:49:47,294 --> 01:49:51,128
<i>...one of four men involved</i>
<i>in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.</i>

All right, hold him.

lt's all right.

1186
01:50:12,574 --> 01:50:13,370
So?

1187
01:50:13,454 --> 01:50:15,285
He's got blood loss and shock.

1188
01:50:15,414 --> 01:50:19,043
l'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

1189
01:50:19,934 --> 01:50:21,049
Bottom line?

1190
01:50:21,534 --> 01:50:24,173
lt's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1191
01:50:24,574 --> 01:50:26,883
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1192
01:50:27,534 --> 01:50:28,603
Six, seven hours.

1193
01:50:28,694 --> 01:50:30,207
-That's it?
-That's it.

1194
01:50:30,574 --> 01:50:32,007
Take off your shirt.

1195
01:50:32,094 --> 01:50:32,765
What?

1196
01:50:34,494 --> 01:50:35,927
Take off your shirt.

1197
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,407
My daughter gave it to me.

1198

1199

Listen to me.

1200
01:51:00,974 --> 01:51:04,808
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1201
01:51:06,094 --> 01:51:07,413
Where's Charlene?

1202
01:51:07,534 --> 01:51:11,209
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

1203
01:51:11,574 --> 01:51:13,530
l'm not going without her.

1204
01:51:13,854 --> 01:51:15,128

To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1208
01:51:22,854 --> 01:51:24,082
Who did it?

1209
01:51:25,374 --> 01:51:26,648
Who wasn't there?

1210
01:51:28,134 --> 01:51:29,044
Trejo.

1211
01:51:32,854 --> 01:51:34,173
See you at Nate's.

1212

Goddamn you, Chris.

1218

Goddamn you.

1219

You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1220
01:52:02,014 --> 01:52:02,969
Right.

1221
01:52:49,374 --> 01:52:51,444
Why did you do it? What happened?

1222
01:52:52,734 --> 01:52:54,247
-They made me.
-Who?

1223
01:52:54,374 --> 01:52:55,363
Where's Anna?

1224
01:52:56,894 --> 01:52:58,009
She's dead.

1225
01:53:00,814 --> 01:53:03,806
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1226
01:53:04,294 --> 01:53:05,409
Who did it?

1227
01:53:05,534 --> 01:53:06,444
Who did it?

1228
01:53:06,534 --> 01:53:08,206
They had Anna, man.

1229
01:53:08,414 --> 01:53:09,210

1230
01:53:10,734 --> 01:53:11,689
Waingro.

1231
01:53:12,574 --> 01:53:13,768
Waingro.

1232
01:53:14,494 --> 01:53:15,609
On his own?

1233
01:53:17,534 --> 01:53:19,126
-For someone.
-Who?

1234
01:53:20,414 --> 01:53:22,166
The other he worked for.

1235
01:53:23,774 --> 01:53:24,968
Van Zant.

1236
01:53:27,814 --> 01:53:28,803
Van Zant?

1237
01:53:33,174 --> 01:53:34,323
Are you sure?

1238
01:53:34,854 --> 01:53:36,082
Van Zant.

1239
01:53:37,774 --> 01:53:40,049
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1240
01:53:41,094 --> 01:53:42,527
l don't think so.

1241
01:53:43,294 --> 01:53:44,204
Come on.

1242
01:53:46,094 --> 01:53:47,607

1243
01:53:52,774 --> 01:53:53,889
l'll call a medic.

1244
01:53:53,974 --> 01:53:55,771
l'm not going to make it.

1245
01:53:57,934 --> 01:53:59,970
l can't feel nothing.

1246
01:54:02,094 --> 01:54:03,573
My Anna's gone.

1247
01:54:06,014 --> 01:54:07,333
She's gone.

1248
01:54:09,534 --> 01:54:11,445
Don't leave me like this.

1249
01:54:12,414 --> 01:54:13,688
Please, homes.

1250
01:54:14,934 --> 01:54:16,845
Don't leave me like this.

1251
01:54:42,654 --> 01:54:45,043
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1252
01:54:45,894 --> 01:54:47,122
lt's a new one.

1253
01:54:48,494 --> 01:54:50,883
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1254
01:54:51,214 --> 01:54:52,329
10725.

1255
01:54:52,894 --> 01:54:54,009
<i>10</i>7<i>25.</i>

1256
01:54:54,654 --> 01:54:55,564
<i>Chris?</i>

1257
01:54:56,054 --> 01:54:57,726
He's with me, my place.

1258
01:54:58,014 --> 01:54:59,686
Next, Waingro, okay?

1259
01:55:02,014 --> 01:55:03,288
You got the time?

1260
01:55:04,214 --> 01:55:05,567
l'll make time.

1261
01:55:05,894 --> 01:55:07,327
And l need a new out.

1262
01:55:08,254 --> 01:55:09,369
ls it blown?

1263
01:55:11,054 --> 01:55:12,646
How can l trust it?

1264
01:55:15,614 --> 01:55:16,729
You got it.

1265
01:55:17,694 --> 01:55:19,127
Stay healthy.

1266
01:55:24,414 --> 01:55:26,006
Charlene Shiherlis.

1267
01:55:26,854 --> 01:55:29,687
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1268
01:55:29,774 --> 01:55:31,127
Neil's transportation.

1269
01:55:31,294 --> 01:55:35,128
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

1270
01:55:35,454 --> 01:55:37,763
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1271
01:55:37,854 --> 01:55:39,412
Sure. Now he needs another.

1272
01:55:39,494 --> 01:55:41,928
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1273
01:55:43,134 --> 01:55:45,523
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1274
01:55:45,614 --> 01:55:49,050
He's a C.l. for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1275
01:55:49,214 --> 01:55:50,772
On Neil McCauley.

1276
01:55:50,934 --> 01:55:52,367
How much time we got?

1277
01:55:52,774 --> 01:55:57,245
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1278
01:56:48,734 --> 01:56:51,407
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1279
01:56:51,614 --> 01:56:52,888
Who told you?

1280
01:56:53,214 --> 01:56:55,444
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1281
01:56:55,774 --> 01:56:56,809
Who?

1282
01:57:39,614 --> 01:57:41,047
Waingro, where is he?

1283
01:57:42,214 --> 01:57:43,044
Where?

1284
01:57:43,134 --> 01:57:44,408
How would l know?

1285
01:58:09,174 --> 01:58:10,163
Well...

1286
01:58:10,694 --> 01:58:12,412
...what do we have here?

1287
01:58:13,294 --> 01:58:14,443
This pretty?

1288
01:58:14,534 --> 01:58:15,603
This pretty?

1289
01:58:19,054 --> 01:58:20,203
You piece of shit.

1290
01:58:20,294 --> 01:58:23,286
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1291
01:58:23,574 --> 01:58:25,292
You want out? This is out.

1292
01:58:25,374 --> 01:58:28,491
-Yeah, what's your end?
-l don't need no stupid broad.

1293
01:58:29,014 --> 01:58:30,413
How'd l get into this?

1294
01:58:30,494 --> 01:58:31,370
Easy.

1295
01:58:32,214 --> 01:58:34,489
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1296
01:58:34,814 --> 01:58:35,929
Fix her a drink.

1297
01:58:36,014 --> 01:58:37,811
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1298
01:58:37,894 --> 01:58:38,929
Fuck her.

1299
01:58:41,214 --> 01:58:43,774
You better get in there and stay in there.

1300
01:58:47,174 --> 01:58:48,527
Lookie here.

1301
01:58:49,974 --> 01:58:52,124
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1302
01:58:52,214 --> 01:58:54,170
You want to put Dominick in the bedroom?

1303
01:58:54,334 --> 01:58:55,733
He stays with me.

1304
01:59:05,934 --> 01:59:07,287
So, what now?

1305
01:59:09,974 --> 01:59:11,043
He's right.

1306
01:59:11,134 --> 01:59:13,090
You want out? This is out.

1307
01:59:14,854 --> 01:59:17,004
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1308
01:59:17,094 --> 01:59:18,288
No shit.

1309
01:59:18,814 --> 01:59:21,123
That's right. You would have to.

1310
01:59:21,694 --> 01:59:25,050
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1311
01:59:26,334 --> 01:59:29,690
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1312
01:59:29,774 --> 01:59:34,325
...'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1313
01:59:34,414 --> 01:59:36,245
...juvenile facilities.

1314
01:59:36,454 --> 01:59:38,172
Then he steals a car.

1315
01:59:38,814 --> 01:59:42,807
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1316
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:45,652
Fucked for life.

1317
01:59:47,414 --> 01:59:50,008
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1318
01:59:51,574 --> 01:59:55,567
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1319
01:59:57,614 --> 02:00:00,253
lf you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1320
02:00:01,174 --> 02:00:02,493
You can do it...

1321
02:00:02,814 --> 02:00:05,009
...for your kid, so you can raise him.

1322
02:00:08,854 --> 02:00:10,173
What else are you selling?

1323
02:00:10,254 --> 02:00:11,607
All kinds of shit.

1324
02:00:13,014 --> 02:00:17,644
But l don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1325
02:00:24,094 --> 02:00:25,368
<i>Here's an update.</i>

1326
02:00:25,534 --> 02:00:27,206
Drucker's on Line 2.

1327
02:00:27,574 --> 02:00:29,053
<i>Hold on for a second.</i>

1328
02:00:31,294 --> 02:00:32,886
Drucker's on the other line.

1329
02:00:33,974 --> 02:00:35,043
Conference him in.

1330
02:00:36,334 --> 02:00:37,210
Go ahead.

1331
02:00:37,694 --> 02:00:39,286
Vincent, it's me.

1332
02:00:41,854 --> 02:00:43,924
One answer. What's it going to be?

1333
02:00:50,614 --> 02:00:53,048
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1334
02:00:53,134 --> 02:00:55,523
That's good. Here's the deal.

1335
02:00:56,494 --> 02:00:59,213
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1336
02:00:59,614 --> 02:01:02,003
...and become a born-again good citizen.

1337
02:01:02,294 --> 02:01:06,128
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1338
02:01:06,734 --> 02:01:11,205
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

1339
02:01:11,454 --> 02:01:12,682
<i>Van Zant.</i>

1340
02:01:14,174 --> 02:01:16,244
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

1341
02:01:16,334 --> 02:01:18,723
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1342
02:01:18,934 --> 02:01:22,085
<i>If Neil goes after anybody else,</i>
<i>it's going to be Waingro.</i>

1343
02:01:22,294 --> 02:01:25,684
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

1344
02:01:25,774 --> 02:01:27,605
...under the name Jamieson.

1345
02:01:27,814 --> 02:01:31,807
He's there now. l want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1346
02:01:32,134 --> 02:01:35,012
<i>...assignment officers</i>
<i>and snitches in County.</i>

1347
02:01:35,254 --> 02:01:39,293
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1348
02:01:39,374 --> 02:01:41,934
<i>...and personally check their coms</i>
<i>every 30 minutes.</i>

1349
02:01:42,014 --> 02:01:44,323
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1350
02:01:44,814 --> 02:01:46,088
How're you feeling?

1351
02:01:46,574 --> 02:01:48,087
Banged up, but l'll live.

1352
02:01:56,894 --> 02:01:58,043
He's here.

1353
02:01:58,894 --> 02:02:00,486
Neil is still here.

1354
02:02:01,614 --> 02:02:03,047
l can feel it.

1355
02:02:03,854 --> 02:02:05,253
For how long?

1356
02:02:06,694 --> 02:02:08,571
Seven, eight hours, max.

1357
02:02:17,574 --> 02:02:18,848
What did you do?

1358
02:02:19,254 --> 02:02:20,164
That was you?

1359
02:02:20,734 --> 02:02:22,372
l don't sell metal.

1360
02:02:23,214 --> 02:02:26,092
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1361
02:02:26,254 --> 02:02:27,767
We gotta go together.

1362
02:02:28,214 --> 02:02:30,205
Those other people were with you?

1363
02:02:31,934 --> 02:02:33,492
My friend, Michael...

1364
02:02:35,134 --> 02:02:36,567
...he knew the risks.

1365
02:02:41,334 --> 02:02:43,290
When it rains, you get wet.

1366
02:02:45,974 --> 02:02:47,327
Get packed. Let's go.

1367
02:03:05,774 --> 02:03:07,412
Why did you do this to me?

1368
02:03:19,094 --> 02:03:20,413
lt'll be all right.

1369
02:03:20,494 --> 02:03:22,007
Do you understand?

1370
02:03:26,814 --> 02:03:28,532
lt's going to be all right.

1371
02:03:39,494 --> 02:03:42,531
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1372
02:03:47,574 --> 02:03:49,007
Here's some cash.

1373
02:03:51,854 --> 02:03:53,082
When is it over?

1374
02:03:56,374 --> 02:03:58,012
Twenty-two hours from now.

1375
02:03:58,334 --> 02:04:01,849
-Then we get out of here clean.
-When will you let me leave?

1376
02:04:05,614 --> 02:04:06,603
Go now.

1377
02:04:06,694 --> 02:04:08,605
You want out? There's the door.

1378
02:04:09,174 --> 02:04:11,085
Will you let me leave later?

1379
02:04:16,014 --> 02:04:17,527
lt will be different.

1380
02:04:19,094 --> 02:04:20,766
Do you even understand?

1381
02:04:50,454 --> 02:04:51,773
lt's ready.

1382
02:04:59,134 --> 02:05:00,886
This is my friend Ralph.

1383
02:05:01,494 --> 02:05:03,405
You didn't tell me you were--

1384
02:05:04,214 --> 02:05:05,533
Oh, my God!

1385
02:05:05,694 --> 02:05:06,888
Where's Lauren?

1386
02:05:07,214 --> 02:05:08,932
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1387
02:05:09,374 --> 02:05:11,365
This has nothing to do with me. l'm sorry.

1388
02:05:11,454 --> 02:05:12,603
What for?

1389
02:05:12,694 --> 02:05:13,809
Sit down.

1390
02:05:14,414 --> 02:05:15,767
Don't you get angry?

1391
02:05:16,894 --> 02:05:17,963
l'm angry.

1392
02:05:19,614 --> 02:05:21,411
l'm very angry, Ralph.

1393
02:05:21,974 --> 02:05:24,647
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1394
02:05:26,414 --> 02:05:29,008
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1395
02:05:30,734 --> 02:05:32,531
ln her ex-husband's...

1396
02:05:33,014 --> 02:05:35,926
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

1397
02:05:36,014 --> 02:05:37,367
...if you want to.

1398
02:05:39,614 --> 02:05:41,764
But you do not get to watch...

1399
02:05:42,454 --> 02:05:43,933
...my fucking...

1400
02:05:44,454 --> 02:05:45,603
...television set!

1401
02:05:45,694 --> 02:05:47,013
For God's sake.

1402
02:05:53,574 --> 02:05:55,326
Put the television set down.

1403
02:05:55,454 --> 02:05:57,922
-l never cheated on you, bitch.
-Maybe you should have.

1404
02:05:58,014 --> 02:06:00,084
-l should have?
-You're a party to this.

1405
02:06:00,174 --> 02:06:03,246
l made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1406
02:06:03,334 --> 02:06:04,926
Our situation is absurd.

1407
02:06:07,414 --> 02:06:09,370
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1408
02:06:12,894 --> 02:06:16,603
Why is it that l have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

1409
02:06:16,774 --> 02:06:19,004
l say what l mean, and l do what l say.

1410
02:06:19,534 --> 02:06:20,569
How admirable.

1411
02:06:20,654 --> 02:06:22,849
-You bet.
-Except none of it's about us.

1412
02:06:23,454 --> 02:06:24,409
No.

1413
02:06:25,814 --> 02:06:28,533
l may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1414
02:06:29,454 --> 02:06:31,490
...you walk through our life dead.

1415
02:06:32,174 --> 02:06:36,087
Now l have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1416
02:06:48,574 --> 02:06:50,883
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1417
02:06:51,374 --> 02:06:52,568
The plane...

1418
02:06:52,974 --> 02:06:55,886
...charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1419
02:06:56,134 --> 02:06:57,965
Call letters are 101 1 Sierra.

1420
02:07:01,094 --> 02:07:02,243
Touches down...

1421
02:07:02,334 --> 02:07:04,768
...holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1422
02:07:04,974 --> 02:07:08,410
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1423
02:07:09,854 --> 02:07:10,923
Where's Chris?

1424
02:07:11,454 --> 02:07:12,489
He's gone.

1425
02:07:13,854 --> 02:07:14,809
What?

1426
02:07:15,454 --> 02:07:17,763
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1427
02:07:17,854 --> 02:07:20,049
-Did you bring him here?
-Yeah, l did.

1428
02:07:20,974 --> 02:07:22,009
What happened?

1429
02:07:23,054 --> 02:07:24,567
lt's a free country.

1430
02:07:29,574 --> 02:07:31,326
Check in with me at 9:00...

1431
02:07:31,694 --> 02:07:33,412
...everything is still cool.

1432
02:07:35,054 --> 02:07:36,169
All right.

1433
02:07:58,574 --> 02:08:00,804
l don't know what l'm doing anymore.

1434
02:08:03,934 --> 02:08:05,686
l know life is short.

1435
02:08:06,294 --> 02:08:08,285
Whatever time you get is luck.

1436
02:08:10,894 --> 02:08:12,407
You want to walk?

1437
02:08:15,134 --> 02:08:16,852
You walk right now...

1438
02:08:18,374 --> 02:08:19,932
...all on your own.

1439
02:08:20,574 --> 02:08:23,134
On your own you choose to come with me.

1440
02:08:29,254 --> 02:08:30,812
All l know is...

1441
02:08:32,974 --> 02:08:36,091
...there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1442
02:08:37,614 --> 02:08:39,525
...if it's going to be alone...

1443
02:08:40,534 --> 02:08:42,013
...without you.

1444
02:09:39,574 --> 02:09:40,563
l got a live one.

1445
02:09:41,534 --> 02:09:42,649
l'll hold.

1446
02:09:45,214 --> 02:09:46,647
Show yourself.

1447
02:09:47,694 --> 02:09:49,207
-Do it.
-Shut up!

1448
02:09:53,374 --> 02:09:55,524
Now, just one second at the window...

1449
02:09:56,734 --> 02:09:58,452
...and it's all over.

1450
02:11:43,934 --> 02:11:44,969
Hey, man...

1451
02:11:47,134 --> 02:11:49,694
...you know any place to rent around here?

1452
02:11:53,014 --> 02:11:55,084
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

1453
02:12:06,894 --> 02:12:07,849
lt's not him.

1454
02:12:07,934 --> 02:12:09,253
lt's not Chris.

1455
02:12:17,054 --> 02:12:18,692
Unit 2, this is Command.

1456
02:12:19,134 --> 02:12:20,408
Take him at the street.

1457
02:12:20,574 --> 02:12:21,723
Check him out.

1458
02:12:48,214 --> 02:12:49,613
He's John Peterson.

1459
02:12:49,694 --> 02:12:51,969
<i>Valid ID. Car's registered to...</i>

1460
02:12:52,134 --> 02:12:53,726
<i>...Bukowski, Gene.</i>

1461
02:12:54,334 --> 02:12:55,449
<i>Ran it to DMV.</i>

1462
02:12:55,534 --> 02:12:56,762
<i>It's clean.</i>

1463
02:12:59,614 --> 02:13:00,683
Let him go.

1464
02:13:01,214 --> 02:13:02,283
Roger.

1465
02:13:02,534 --> 02:13:04,445
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1466
02:13:06,334 --> 02:13:07,164
lt's no-go.

1467
02:13:17,134 --> 02:13:19,853
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1468
02:13:19,934 --> 02:13:21,606
Yeah, that would be nice.

1469
02:13:51,454 --> 02:13:52,773
What do you got?

1470
02:13:52,854 --> 02:13:54,253
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1471
02:14:06,934 --> 02:14:08,367
Hello, it's Vincent.

1472
02:14:08,934 --> 02:14:09,969
<i>What do you got?</i>

1473
02:14:10,054 --> 02:14:12,204
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1474
02:14:12,734 --> 02:14:13,803
<i>That's it.</i>

1475
02:14:22,214 --> 02:14:23,488
You know what?

1476
02:14:25,934 --> 02:14:27,333
Neil is gone.

1477
02:14:32,214 --> 02:14:33,727
Flying like a bird.

1478
02:14:34,254 --> 02:14:35,528
How do you know?

1479
02:14:37,534 --> 02:14:38,410
We still got bait!

1480
02:14:38,494 --> 02:14:40,530
-Maybe some time!
-What do we got?

1481
02:14:40,694 --> 02:14:41,968
What do we got?

1482
02:14:42,814 --> 02:14:44,725
<i>Bon voyage</i>, motherfucker.

1483
02:14:46,134 --> 02:14:47,567
You were good.

1484
02:14:49,294 --> 02:14:50,886
l'm going to the hotel.

1485
02:14:52,094 --> 02:14:54,005
l'm going to take a shower...

1486
02:14:54,974 --> 02:14:57,283
...and l'm going to sleep for a month.

1487
02:17:03,214 --> 02:17:04,249
Here.

1488
02:17:11,054 --> 02:17:11,964
Come on.

1489
02:17:20,374 --> 02:17:21,409
Shit.

1490
02:17:30,294 --> 02:17:31,966
Motherfucking waste.

1491
02:17:35,294 --> 02:17:37,967
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1492
02:17:38,054 --> 02:17:39,282
Not you, baby.

1493
02:17:39,374 --> 02:17:40,568
Not you.

1494
02:17:45,654 --> 02:17:48,248
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1495
02:17:48,414 --> 02:17:51,133
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1496
02:17:58,374 --> 02:18:00,410
l need somebody to help....

1497
02:18:06,294 --> 02:18:07,283
l got you.

1498
02:18:08,614 --> 02:18:11,606
You'll be all right, l swear. lt's okay, baby.

1499
02:18:12,094 --> 02:18:13,573
Let's get a doctor!

1500
02:18:13,654 --> 02:18:15,326
Let's go! A doctor here!

1501
02:18:15,614 --> 02:18:17,923
-There's your mama.
-Let's just calm down.

1502
02:18:18,014 --> 02:18:20,084
-ls she on any drugs?
-l'm calm. No.

1503
02:18:22,654 --> 02:18:25,043
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1504
02:18:25,254 --> 02:18:28,610
l think she cut both arteries.
l could hardly feel her pulse.

1505
02:18:28,934 --> 02:18:30,083
Her pressure's down.

1506
02:18:30,174 --> 02:18:32,244
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1507
02:18:32,334 --> 02:18:33,528
lt's ready.

1508
02:18:35,174 --> 02:18:37,130
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1509
02:18:37,214 --> 02:18:38,283
l don't know.

1510
02:18:38,374 --> 02:18:39,693
Where did you find her?

1511
02:18:39,774 --> 02:18:40,889
The bathtub.

1512
02:18:42,774 --> 02:18:44,810
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1513
02:18:45,054 --> 02:18:46,453
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1514
02:18:46,534 --> 02:18:49,765
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

1515
02:18:51,614 --> 02:18:54,890
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1516
02:18:54,974 --> 02:18:57,852
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1517
02:19:04,094 --> 02:19:07,006
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

1518
02:19:07,094 --> 02:19:08,527
Her vital signs are stable.

1519
02:19:08,614 --> 02:19:11,174
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

1520
02:19:11,294 --> 02:19:12,204
She's okay?

1521
02:19:12,294 --> 02:19:13,363
She's doing good.

1522
02:19:13,454 --> 02:19:14,933
She'll be okay.

1523
02:19:15,374 --> 02:19:17,205
She's going to be okay.

1524
02:19:17,374 --> 02:19:20,172
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1525
02:19:21,534 --> 02:19:24,526
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1526
02:19:28,734 --> 02:19:31,294
lt's all right. lt's going to be all right.

1527
02:19:31,694 --> 02:19:33,730
l'm here. l ain't going anywhere.

1528
02:19:33,814 --> 02:19:36,487
Do you understand?
l ain't going anywhere.

1529
02:19:50,814 --> 02:19:51,769
lt's me.

1530
02:19:52,294 --> 02:19:54,967
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1531
02:19:55,574 --> 02:19:57,405
l still can't find a driver...

1532
02:19:57,534 --> 02:19:59,172
<i>...so that's in the trust.</i>

1533
02:19:59,534 --> 02:20:00,887
<i>One other thing...</i>

1534
02:20:01,854 --> 02:20:03,333
<i>...I gotta tell you.</i>

1535
02:20:04,094 --> 02:20:07,928
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1536
02:20:08,294 --> 02:20:10,012
<i>...which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

1537
02:20:10,254 --> 02:20:11,607
You figured right.

1538
02:20:12,014 --> 02:20:13,527
So, so long, brother.

1539
02:20:15,654 --> 02:20:17,087
You take it easy.

1540
02:20:17,734 --> 02:20:19,008
You're home free.

1541
02:20:20,974 --> 02:20:22,168
Take it easy.

1542
02:20:32,734 --> 02:20:33,803
What is it?

1543
02:20:34,094 --> 02:20:35,243
Nothing.

1544
02:20:35,534 --> 02:20:36,728
Home free.

1545
02:21:13,334 --> 02:21:15,165
l gotta take care of something.

1546
02:21:15,294 --> 02:21:16,409
ls there time?

1547
02:21:17,174 --> 02:21:18,323
There's time.

1548
02:21:46,054 --> 02:21:48,614
l'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1549
02:22:29,134 --> 02:22:29,930
<i>Registration.</i>

1550
02:22:30,014 --> 02:22:31,208
This is room service.

1551
02:22:31,294 --> 02:22:35,048
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1552
02:22:35,134 --> 02:22:36,886
-<i>They're always doing that.</i>
-l know.

1553
02:22:36,974 --> 02:22:38,168
<i>1</i> 7<i>35.</i>

1554
02:22:38,454 --> 02:22:39,648
Thank you.

1555
02:24:19,214 --> 02:24:20,852
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1556
02:24:20,934 --> 02:24:23,209
<i>We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1557
02:24:24,414 --> 02:24:25,847
<i>Do not panic.</i>

1558
02:24:26,014 --> 02:24:27,766
<i>Do not take the elevators.</i>

1559
02:24:32,854 --> 02:24:33,923
l'm staying here.

1560
02:24:34,014 --> 02:24:37,211
l'll check the stairs.
lf there's smoke, l'll pull you out.

1561
02:24:41,694 --> 02:24:43,924
What about her dad? Should l call him?

1562
02:24:44,934 --> 02:24:47,084
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1563
02:24:49,054 --> 02:24:50,646
And she chose you.

1564
02:24:53,134 --> 02:24:54,886
She picked your place.

1565
02:24:56,974 --> 02:24:58,885
lt's not right, what happened to her.

1566
02:24:58,974 --> 02:25:00,089
No, it's not.

1567
02:25:16,094 --> 02:25:17,766
ls there any way that...

1568
02:25:20,014 --> 02:25:22,005
...it could work out between us?

1569
02:25:24,694 --> 02:25:26,969
l wish l could say yes, you know.

1570
02:25:27,294 --> 02:25:28,329
But...

1571
02:25:28,494 --> 02:25:30,007
...in the end....

1572
02:25:34,734 --> 02:25:36,406
lt's like you said:

1573
02:25:39,414 --> 02:25:40,733
All l am...

1574
02:25:41,374 --> 02:25:43,410
...is what l'm going after.

1575
02:25:50,494 --> 02:25:52,610
l'm not what you want, Justine.

1576
02:26:03,254 --> 02:26:04,733
Go on, if you have to.

1577
02:26:07,774 --> 02:26:08,889
l'll stay.

1578
02:26:08,974 --> 02:26:10,805
l'm okay. l can handle this.

1579
02:26:13,854 --> 02:26:15,287
Just be careful.

1580
02:26:16,014 --> 02:26:18,574
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1581
02:26:19,614 --> 02:26:20,569
Okay?

1582
02:27:18,894 --> 02:27:20,691
Security. There's a fire on three.

1583
02:27:21,134 --> 02:27:22,852
We have to evacuate all floors.

1584
02:27:22,934 --> 02:27:24,367
l can't leave here.

1585
02:27:33,014 --> 02:27:35,926
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1586
02:27:49,614 --> 02:27:50,888
He's here on 17.

1587
02:27:53,734 --> 02:27:54,928
Look at me.

1588
02:27:55,054 --> 02:27:56,089
Look at me!

1589
02:27:59,294 --> 02:28:00,329
Look at me!

1590
02:28:30,974 --> 02:28:32,327
LAPD! Don't move!

1591
02:28:32,414 --> 02:28:34,166
Put your hands on your head!

1592
02:29:08,254 --> 02:29:09,846
Switch me to TAC 5.

1593
02:29:10,614 --> 02:29:11,808
Casals....

1594
02:29:12,094 --> 02:29:13,004
JJ....
