00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:11,686
<i>You wanna talk about
the vanishing wilderness?</i>

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,688
<i>Why are you so anxious about this?</i>

3
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:16,691
<i>Because they're building a dam
across the Cahulawasse River.</i>

4
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:19,318
<i>They're gonna flood a whole valley, Bobby.</i>

5
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:22,363
<i>They're drowning the river, man.</i>

6
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:27,910
<i>- We're talkin' to you.
- All right.</i>

7
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:32,832
<i>Just about the last wild, untamed,
unpolluted, unfucked-up river in the South.</i>

8
00:00:34,376 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>- Don't you understand?
- We understand.</i>

9
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:41,133
<i>There ain't gonna be no more river.
Just gonna be a big, dead lake.</i>

10
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:44,512
<i>It's a very clean way
to make electric power.</i>

11
00:00:44,637 --> 00:00:47,222
<i>Those lakes provide many people
with recreation.</i>

12
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:51,935
<i>My father-in-law has a houseboat
on Lake Bowie.</i>

13
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,400
<i>You push a little more power into Atlanta...</i>

14
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,779
<i>... a little more air conditioners
for your smug little suburb...</i>

15
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,867
<i>... and you know what's gonna happen?
They're gonna rape this whole landscape.</i>

16
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,869
<i>They're gonna rape it.</i>

17
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:11,247
<i>- That's an extreme point of view, Lewis.
- It is.</i>

18
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:12,790
<i>Extremist.</i>

<i>We're gonna leave Friday from Atlanta.</i>

21
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,169
<i>I'm gonna have you back
in your little suburban house...</i>

22
00:01:56,293 --> 00:01:59,297
<i>... in time to see the football game
on Sunday afternoon.</i>

23
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:03,134
<i>I know you'll be back in time to see
the pompom girls at halftime.</i>

24
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:04,970
<i>I know that's all you care about.</i>

25
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:07,222
<i>Lewis, I wanna thank you.</i>

26
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:17,274
<i>Is there any hillbillies up here?</i>

27
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:21,404
<i>Yeah, there's some people up there
that ain't never seen a town before.</i>

28
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:25,116
<i>No bigger than Aintry, anyway.
Them, those woods, are real deep.</i>

29
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,369
<i>The river's inaccessible,
except at a couple of points.</i>

30
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,621
<i>How we gonna get there, Lewis?</i>

31
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,959
<i>I'm gonna take you there.</i>

32
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:36,877
<i>What the hell do you know about canoein'?</i>

33
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,132
<i>I know enough about canoein'
to handle the both of you.</i>

34
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:44,386
<i>I don't know what that means,
but I'll go along with you.</i>

35
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:48,931
<i>This is the last chance we got
to see this river.</i>

36
00:02:49,056 --> 00:02:51,560
<i>Just wait until you feel
that white water under you.</i>

37
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,437
<i>- Ain't that right?
- I don't know if I'm ready.</i>

38
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:06,159
If we are lost, I don't wanna hear about it.

39
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:08,535
I've never been lost in my life.

40
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:12,040
I'll have you in the water in another hour.

41
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,170
Christ, Drew!

42
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:20,213
Drew, look at the junk.

43
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:22,467
Look here.

44
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:27,847
I think this is where everything finishes up.

45
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:30,058
We just may be at the end of the line.

46
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,478
Hey, not so loud, Bobby.
Let's not upset these people.

47
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:34,938
People?

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,859
What people?

49
00:03:41,194 --> 00:03:43,489
This area may be evacuated already.

50
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,706
That's my '51 Dodge.

51
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:56,001
No, that's my car. That's my car.

52
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,340
All my youth and passion...

53
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,426
...spent in that back seat.

54
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:07,429
It's all gone you see.

55
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:10,100
All gone. Rust and dust.

56
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:17,315
Lewis...

57
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,859
...we got a live one here.

58
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:24,990
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

59
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:27,701
Let me ask you something.

60
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,497
Are you from the power company?

61
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,332
Power company?

62
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,711
What power company?

63
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,379
About the dam.

64
00:04:40,506 --> 00:04:41,591
No, no, no.

65
00:04:41,799 --> 00:04:44,467
Look, come here a minute.
See that car there?

66
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:49,181
We want somebody to drive 'em
down to Aintry for us.

67
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:52,727
Hell, you're crazy.

68
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,354
No shit.

69
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:59,567
Fill that one up with gas, okay?

70
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,870
Say, mister...

71
00:05:11,622 --> 00:05:13,665
I love the way you wear that hat.

72
00:05:26,553 --> 00:05:28,264
You don't know nothin'.

73
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:16,438
Lewis, just ask him about his hat.

74
00:06:34,707 --> 00:06:38,044
I don't think you understood me.
I wanna get some drivers...

75
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,423
...to drive this car...

76
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,966
...and that car down to Aintry.

77
00:06:43,174 --> 00:06:44,217
You understand?

78
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,387
You might get the Griner brothers.

79
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,848
- Who?
- The Griner brothers.

80
00:06:50,891 --> 00:06:52,268
Where do they live?

81
00:06:52,393 --> 00:06:54,436
They live back over that way.

82
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:12,539
$4.99.

83
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,040
Right.

84
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:24,885
Talk about genetic deficiencies.

85
00:07:25,677 --> 00:07:27,053
Isn't that pitiful?

86
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,723
Who's pickin' the banjo here?

87
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,163
Come on, I'm with you.

88
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,047
I'm lost.

89
00:09:26,636 --> 00:09:28,596
I could play all day with that guy.

90
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:31,724
I believe you could, too.
I believe you could.

91
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,769
- That's good.
- That's very good, sir.

92
00:09:33,894 --> 00:09:35,937
Goddamn, you play a mean banjo.

93
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:41,859
Hey, you wanna play another one?

94
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,863
Give him a couple of bucks.

95
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,783
Can that Chubby boy handle himself?

96
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,369
Who? Bobby?

97
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:55,582
He's rather well thought of
in his field, Lewis.

98
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,002
Insurance?

99
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:20,108
I've never been insured in my life.
I don't believe in insurance.

100
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:24,988
There's no risk.

101
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,829
I have some.

102
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,104
Over here.

103
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:07,866
Shit!

104
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:10,368
God almighty!

105
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:21,463
Anything we can do for you?

106
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:25,634
No. It ain't as bad as I thought.

107
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:29,639
Your name Griner?

108
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,474
What do you wanna know for?

109
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:38,438
Can you and your brother drive two cars
down to Aintry for us?

110
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:41,067
Drive 'em down there for what?

111
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:45,655
Me and my buddy, we're gonna take
a canoe trip down the Cahulawasse.

112
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,950
We'd like to have them cars in Aintry
when we get there.

113
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:51,160
Be there by Sunday noon.

114
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:52,870
Canoe trip?

115
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:56,416
That's right, a canoe trip.

116
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,964
What the hell you wanna go fuck around
in that river for?

117
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:06,260
Because it's there.

118
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:10,931
It's there all right.

119
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:14,893
You get in there and can't get out,
you gonna wish it wasn't.

120
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,648
Listen, Lewis, let's go back to town and...

121
00:12:20,148 --> 00:12:21,359
...play golf.

122
00:12:26,071 --> 00:12:29,075
I'll give you $30 to take those cars
down to Aintry.

123
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:34,038
I'd take $50.

124
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,459
$50, my ass.

125
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:42,171
Lewis, don't play games with these people.

126
00:12:42,463 --> 00:12:43,756
What'd you say?

127
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:48,137
I said, "$50, my ass."

128
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:50,096
Lewis!

129
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,478
I'll do it for $40.

130
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,235
You good for $10?

131
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:04,528
Sure.

132
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:06,238
You got it.

133
00:13:10,117 --> 00:13:11,035
Brando!

134
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,537
- Lewis, you guys all right?
- All set.

135
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,164
Brando, come on out!

136
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:17,958
- We heard all this...
- I said it's all set, Drew.

137
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,295
This river cruise gonna happen or not?

138
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,338
Just get in your car, huh?

139
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:47,197
Lewis, for God's sake!

140
00:13:58,376 --> 00:14:00,669
You think we should let 'em
show us to the river?

141
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:03,798
If I thought that,
I would have let them go first, Ed.

142
00:14:03,923 --> 00:14:05,633
We know about where it is.

143
00:14:10,554 --> 00:14:11,640
Here we go.

144
00:14:21,607 --> 00:14:23,068
Well, we fucked up.

145
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:29,074
You better let them show us.

146
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,535
You're missin' the whole point, Ed.

147
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:38,792
Where are you goin', city boy?

148
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:40,877
We'll find it.

149
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:43,673
It's only the biggest fuckin' river
in the state.

150
00:14:43,798 --> 00:14:45,257
We'll find it.

151
00:14:54,934 --> 00:14:58,437
Lewis, you son of a bitch,
why do we have to go so damn fast?

152
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,148
You're gonna like it.

153
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:02,942
When you see the river,
you're gonna like it.

154
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,243
Jesus Christ!

155
00:15:17,832 --> 00:15:19,877
- Lewis.
- Are you all right?

156
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,888
Lewis, you are gonna kill us both,
you son of a bitch...

157
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,973
...before we ever see any water.

158
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,852
Slow it down, Lewis, come on.
Come on, don't fool around.

159
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,326
Listen, Ed.

160
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,372
Listen.

161
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:01,963
Hear it?

162
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,827
Sometimes you have to lose yourself
before you can find anything.

163
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,164
Any snakes around here?

164
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,550
This is the one.

165
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,012
There she is.

166
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:58,312
Looks good.

167
00:17:01,773 --> 00:17:04,611
A couple of more months
and she'll all be gone.

168
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,779
Even up as far as here?

169
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:10,950
From Aintry on up.

170
00:17:12,702 --> 00:17:15,163
One big, dead lake.

171
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:17,373
Over here!

172
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:22,295
Couldn't we have found a harder place
to get in?

173
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:24,672
- This is steep here, now.
- All right.

174
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,799
- Watch yourself.
- I'm watchin'.

175
00:17:29,636 --> 00:17:31,597
You're losin' glass on your bow.

176
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:32,973
It's freezin'!

177
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,474
Hell, it'll hold.

178
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,227
What the hell are we gonna do...

179
00:17:38,646 --> 00:17:41,565
...if we come off this river
and our cars aren't there?

180
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,025
They'll be there.

181
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,277
They're rough-lookin' boys, them hillbillies.

182
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:48,489
You judge people by the way they look.
You can trust 'em.

183
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:55,746
I'm goin' with you, Ed,
and not with Mr. Lewis Medlock.

184
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,291
I saw how he drives these country roads...

185
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,251
...he don't know nothin' about.

186
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:04,422
I guess you're gonna be with me, Chubby.
Get them supplies up there.

187
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:07,049
It's cold!

188
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:08,551
Put this on.

189
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,888
Looks like my mama's corset or something.

190
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,432
Here you go.

191
00:18:14,724 --> 00:18:15,767
Thank you.

192
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,686
- Okay, let's go.
- I'm comin'.

193
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:20,480
Can't go in the water
without your paddle, boy.

194
00:18:20,814 --> 00:18:23,401
I coulda went up the river without my oar.

195
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,027
Shit!

196
00:18:26,736 --> 00:18:28,614
If we hit any strong water...

197
00:18:29,198 --> 00:18:31,658
...instead of bare-assin' through it...
- I'm ready.

198
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:33,243
- Come on.
- I'm comin' on.

199
00:18:33,493 --> 00:18:35,371
I got myself a plump partner here.

200
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,956
We can save ourselves
considerable hardship...

201
00:18:38,081 --> 00:18:41,002
...if we just back water,
talk it out before we make our move.

202
00:18:41,127 --> 00:18:42,378
You got that, boy?

203
00:18:42,503 --> 00:18:44,630
All right, put on your life jacket.

204
00:18:46,173 --> 00:18:47,550
Which way are we goin'?

205
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:50,178
I think downstream would be a good idea,
don't you?

206
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:51,470
All right.

207
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:54,683
You and Bobby see some rocks,
you yell out now, right?

208
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:58,311
Lewis, is this the way
you get your rocks off?

209
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:00,814
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

210
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,400
- Keep your eyes open, Drew.
- I'll race you.

211
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,152
Keep your eyes open, Robert.

212
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,196
That a boy, that a boy.

213
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,950
Every move you make, call it out.
I'm behind you.

214
00:19:12,075 --> 00:19:13,535
Right. Here we go.

215
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:15,872
See how fast we can shoot this bush.

216
00:19:15,997 --> 00:19:16,997
What is this?

217
00:19:17,581 --> 00:19:19,791
Is this some fast water we're comin' up to?

218
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:23,462
All right, Drew,
just get in behind Lewis there.

219
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:25,422
Look at this!

220
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:28,801
- Let's pick up some speed.
- All right. Let's go.

221
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:31,053
Just a little, there you have it.

222
00:19:51,741 --> 00:19:52,910
To the left.

223
00:19:53,911 --> 00:19:56,371
Hey, now, that didn't hurt too bad, did it?

224
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:00,918
I'm with you, Ed.

225
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:04,380
Now you got it, boy. Very good.

226
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,067
Look, Ed.

227
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:33,221
Well, for the Lord's sake,
will you look at that?

228
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:35,432
What do we do now?

229
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,525
This is gonna be fun!

230
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:47,277
Just follow us!

231
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:50,365
Hey, what happens
if we flip this thing over?

232
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:53,701
Now that you brought that up,
hang on to your paddle.

233
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:58,205
And if you hit any rocks,
don't hit 'em with your head.

234
00:21:58,873 --> 00:21:59,999
Watch Lewis.

235
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:03,002
Maybe we can learn something.
Back water now.

236
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:10,594
Oh, yeah.

237
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:12,762
Go right.

238
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:14,807
Go right, go right.

239
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:18,643
Go right, go right.

240
00:22:18,893 --> 00:22:22,314
- Look up ahead where you're goin'!
- All right, I'm lookin'.

241
00:22:25,651 --> 00:22:28,404
Don't quit, don't quit.
Come on, paddle, paddle.

242
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:30,198
Okay!

243
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:36,870
We did it!

244
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,630
Are you gonna call them out now?

245
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,425
- Right, go right.
- Go right.

246
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:49,676
All right, now left.

247
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,261
Left, to your left.

248
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:53,513
All right.

249
00:22:58,602 --> 00:23:00,228
- Keep it straight.
- Watch that tree.

250
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,189
- Left.
- Watch your head.

251
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:03,815
We ain't gonna make it!

252
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:07,069
Turn it!

253
00:23:13,326 --> 00:23:15,286
Hey, this doesn't seem right.

254
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,832
Just a little unorthodox.

255
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:27,006
Go left, Chubby. Come on.
Straighten it out.

256
00:23:27,131 --> 00:23:29,008
All right, I got it straight.

257
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,595
Oh, my God!

258
00:23:34,222 --> 00:23:36,182
- Yes, thank you, Lord.
- Turn it around.

259
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:38,393
Hold it up there. Slow it down.

260
00:23:38,518 --> 00:23:40,062
All right, go.

261
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,271
Go!

262
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:44,816
Good, push straight ahead.

263
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,820
Hell, here's a big one!

264
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,949
We're gonna make it. Keep it straight.

265
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:53,450
I'm with you, Ed!

266
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:04,879
All right. You're doin' all right, now.

267
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:11,177
Keep her headed right.

268
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:17,809
Go, go, go...

269
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:28,152
There's a rock!

270
00:24:29,237 --> 00:24:30,698
On the right, watch it now.

271
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,866
- Okay, now.
- I got it.

272
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:39,747
All right now, Chubby, don't fall apart.

273
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:51,051
What the hell I tell you?
He's something else, ain't he?

274
00:24:52,595 --> 00:24:54,388
- Hold on.
- I'll tell you, Lewis...

275
00:24:54,513 --> 00:24:57,601
...that's the best,
the second best sensation I ever felt.

276
00:24:57,892 --> 00:24:59,768
You did good, Chubby, you did good.

277
00:24:59,893 --> 00:25:02,814
Damn, I thought we'd bought
the farm there for a while.

278
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:04,524
You know that one place there...

279
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:06,775
You know what I was just thinking?

280
00:25:07,444 --> 00:25:09,863
The first explorers saw this country...

281
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,699
...saw it just like us.

282
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,035
In a canoe.

283
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:17,454
I can imagine how they felt.

284
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,874
Yeah, we beat it, didn't we?

285
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,836
Didn't we beat that?

286
00:25:25,211 --> 00:25:26,671
You don't beat it.

287
00:25:28,257 --> 00:25:30,051
You don't beat this river.

288
00:26:18,267 --> 00:26:19,893
Machines are gonna fail.

289
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,397
And the system's gonna fail.

290
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:26,276
Then...

291
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,237
And then what?

292
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:32,365
Then survival.
Who has the ability to survive.

293
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:35,201
That's the game: Survive.

294
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:40,039
And you can't wait for it to happen,
can you?

295
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,959
You can't wait for it.

296
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:45,920
Well, the system's done all right by me.

297
00:26:47,423 --> 00:26:48,632
Oh, yeah.

298
00:26:50,883 --> 00:26:52,511
You got a nice job.

299
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:55,388
Got a nice house...

300
00:26:56,556 --> 00:26:57,933
...nice wife...

301
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,768
...nice kid.

302
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:03,105
You make that sound...

303
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,066
...rather shitty, Lewis.

304
00:27:07,986 --> 00:27:10,446
Why do you go on these trips with me, Ed?

305
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,992
I like my life, Lewis.

306
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,749
Yeah, but why do you go
on these trips with me?

307
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,545
You know, sometimes I wonder about that.

308
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:38,058
Here's to you, Lewis.

309
00:27:39,602 --> 00:27:41,645
Hot damn, he got one!

310
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,274
Terrific, Lewis.

311
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:47,400
I hate him.

312
00:28:32,531 --> 00:28:34,324
I'm glad we came here.

313
00:28:35,325 --> 00:28:36,493
Lewis?

314
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,204
Lewis does not drink.

315
00:29:09,486 --> 00:29:11,863
It's true, Lewis, what you said.

316
00:29:13,364 --> 00:29:17,328
There's somethin' in the woods
and the water that we have lost in the city.

317
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:21,290
We didn't lose it, just sold it.

318
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,336
Well, I'll say one thing for the system.

319
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,839
System did produce the air mattress.

320
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:34,011
Or, as it's better known among
we camping types, the instant broad.

321
00:29:37,056 --> 00:29:41,353
And if you fellas will excuse me,
I'm gonna go be mean to my air mattress.

322
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:46,983
I do baptize thee now,
in the name of modern technology.

323
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:49,235
How sweet, yeah.

324
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:00,998
Lewis?

325
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,918
Does he think he is Tarzan, or what?

326
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:14,929
He knows the woods, though.
He really does.

327
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:16,262
Not really.

328
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:20,851
He learned 'em, he doesn't feel 'em.
That's his problem.

329
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:23,437
He wants to be one with nature
and he can't hack it.

330
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,065
This is a hell of a time to be tellin' us that.

331
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:43,375
Jesus!

332
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,711
Lewis, you scared the shit out of me!

333
00:30:46,628 --> 00:30:48,255
Oh, who was it, Lewis?

334
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:55,387
I don't know. I thought I heard something.

335
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:57,389
Something or someone?

336
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,102
I don't know.

337
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,327
Good night, Lewis.

338
00:31:18,411 --> 00:31:19,705
Good night, Drew.

339
00:31:22,874 --> 00:31:24,334
I'm goin' to sleep.

340
00:31:30,257 --> 00:31:31,634
Night has fallen.

341
00:31:32,551 --> 00:31:34,927
And there's nothin' we can do about it.

342
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:40,350
I had my first wet dream in a sleepin' bag.

343
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:41,894
How was it?

344
00:31:42,227 --> 00:31:43,437
Great.

345
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,231
There's no repeatin' it.

346
00:31:46,482 --> 00:31:47,733
Never mind.

347
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,536
No matter what disaster may occur
in other parts of the world...

348
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:05,001
...or what petty little problems...

349
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:07,087
...arise in Atlanta...

350
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:10,674
...no one can find us up here.

351
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:18,598
Good night, Lewis.

352
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,627
Goddamn it!

353
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:37,263
Hey, Bobby,
look what came out of the forest.

354
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:40,390
Get a shot, Ed?

355
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:43,936
Hell, sometimes a man can...

356
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,063
...hunt for three years...

357
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:49,442
...never get a shot. Isn't that right, Lewis?
- Right.

358
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:52,278
I don't understand
how anyone could shoot an animal.

359
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:54,280
Some people never can, Drew.

360
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:57,534
I've known tournament archers,
damn good shots.

361
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,911
Never out of the five ring.

362
00:36:00,036 --> 00:36:02,873
Draw down on a live animal
and they get buck fever.

363
00:36:04,416 --> 00:36:05,959
What the hell's that?

364
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,921
Loss of control, psychological.

365
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,089
Who gives a shit?

366
00:36:12,298 --> 00:36:15,135
You take that Chubby boy
with you today, okay?

367
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:26,939
Hope we can get off this river today.

368
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:28,524
Don't get too far ahead, now.

369
00:36:28,649 --> 00:36:30,442
No, we'll be takin' it slow.

370
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:36,157
Easy, easy, my man.

371
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:39,368
I got eaten alive last night.
My bites have got bites.

372
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,288
I'm a salesman, Ed.

373
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:43,831
Good morning.

374
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:48,378
I'm not mad at you, Ed.
Just do me a favor, don't holler at me.

375
00:36:48,503 --> 00:36:50,463
I'm not used to bein' hollered at.

376
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:53,550
Damn friend of yours screamed at me
all day long yesterday.

377
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:55,469
Paddle, you son of a bitch.

378
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:49,858
Look!

379
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:07,251
What in the hell are Lewis and Drew
doin' up there anyway?

380
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,381
Probably they're doin'
the same thing we are.

381
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:32,569
Bobby?

382
00:38:56,094 --> 00:38:57,470
How goes it?

383
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:05,353
What the hell you think you're doing?

384
00:39:08,523 --> 00:39:10,150
Headin' downriver.

385
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:14,112
Little canoe trip. Headin' for Aintry.

386
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:15,655
Aintry?

387
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,784
Sure, this river only runs one way, Captain.
Haven't you heard?

388
00:39:20,493 --> 00:39:22,997
You ain't never gonna get down to Aintry.

389
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:25,206
Why not?

390
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,501
'Cause.

391
00:39:28,294 --> 00:39:30,338
This river don't go to Aintry.

392
00:39:31,339 --> 00:39:33,382
You done taken the wrong turn.

393
00:39:34,008 --> 00:39:37,511
See, this here river don't go nowhere
near Aintry.

394
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:43,810
Where does it go then?

395
00:39:51,942 --> 00:39:53,319
Boy, you are lost.

396
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:56,448
Well, hell, I guess this river
comes out somewhere, don't it?

397
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:58,867
That's where we're going, somewhere.

398
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:01,161
Look, we don't want any trouble here.

399
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:04,289
If you gentlemen have a still near here,
that's fine with us.

400
00:40:04,373 --> 00:40:07,376
Why sure. We'd never tell anybody
where it is.

401
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:09,629
You know something?
You're right, we're lost.

402
00:40:09,712 --> 00:40:12,547
- We don't know where in the hell we are.
- A still?

403
00:40:12,673 --> 00:40:15,385
Right, yeah, you're makin' whiskey up here.

404
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:17,594
We'll buy some. We could use it.

405
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,429
Do you know what you're talkin' about?

406
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,516
We don't know what you're talking about.

407
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,893
You said something about makin' whiskey.
Ain't that what you said?

408
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:29,232
We don't know what you're doing,
and we don't care.

409
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,484
That's none of our business.

410
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:33,778
That's right,
none of your goddamn business.

411
00:40:33,861 --> 00:40:36,489
We've got quite a long journey
ahead of us, gentlemen...

412
00:40:36,572 --> 00:40:37,573
Hold it.

413
00:40:37,907 --> 00:40:40,076
You ain't going no damn where!

414
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,540
This is ridiculous. Excuse me.

415
00:40:45,623 --> 00:40:49,085
Hold it, or I'll blow your guts out
all over these woods.

416
00:40:53,757 --> 00:40:55,675
Wait, we can talk this thing over.

417
00:40:55,758 --> 00:40:57,636
What is it you require of us?

418
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,557
Well, we require that you get
your goddamn ass up in them woods.

419
00:41:01,683 --> 00:41:04,560
- All right, now, look.
- Right now! You get up there now.

420
00:41:04,643 --> 00:41:05,978
Okay, all right.

421
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:07,772
- Get up there.
- All right.

422
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:09,315
Faster, boy.

423
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:12,319
- Move your ass.
- Easy with the weapon!

424
00:41:12,402 --> 00:41:13,737
You shut up.

425
00:41:14,112 --> 00:41:15,487
- Come on.
- Okay.

426
00:41:15,738 --> 00:41:17,364
- Back here.
- What's the trouble?

427
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,577
- You're in trouble.
- Just don't argue with 'em, Ed.

428
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:23,455
- See that saplin' over yonder?
- You heard him.

429
00:41:23,872 --> 00:41:25,457
Back up against this.

430
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,001
Is this a matter of money?

431
00:41:28,084 --> 00:41:29,544
If we want money, we'll take it.

432
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:33,507
- Back up against the tree.
- I'm pretty far back against it now.

433
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:36,968
Now, stay just there. Now, be real still.

434
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:41,389
If he tries that again, shoot that one there.

435
00:41:41,473 --> 00:41:44,101
I'll blow his damned balls off.

436
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:46,771
You ain't a big boy.

437
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,730
Be still now.

438
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:04,455
Now let's you just drop them pants.

439
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:06,916
Drop?

440
00:42:06,999 --> 00:42:08,876
Just take 'em right off!

441
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,338
I mean, what's this all about?

442
00:42:11,421 --> 00:42:13,631
Don't say anything, just do it.

443
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,550
Just drop 'em, boy!

444
00:42:18,887 --> 00:42:21,848
You ever had your balls cut off,
you fuckin' ape?

445
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:24,226
Lord.

446
00:42:26,228 --> 00:42:29,940
Look there, that's sharp.
I bet it'd shave a hair.

447
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:32,359
Why don't you try it and see?

448
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:35,153
Lord. Deliver us from all...

449
00:42:39,282 --> 00:42:42,286
Pull off that little bitty shirt there, too.

450
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:49,502
Is he bleeding?

451
00:42:49,919 --> 00:42:51,129
He bled.

452
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,634
Them panties, take 'em off.

453
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:19,366
Get up, boy!

454
00:43:20,284 --> 00:43:21,994
Come on, get on up there.

455
00:43:25,914 --> 00:43:27,499
No, no, no.

456
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:31,462
Oh, no. Don't.

457
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:35,050
- Don't.
- Hey, boy.

458
00:43:36,176 --> 00:43:38,093
- You look just like a hog.
- No, don't.

459
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:41,973
Just like a hog.
Come here, piggy, piggy, piggy.

460
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:44,309
Come on, piggy. Come on, piggy.

461
00:43:44,392 --> 00:43:46,728
Come on, piggy, give me a ride.

462
00:43:47,812 --> 00:43:50,065
- Get up and give me a ride.
- All right.

463
00:43:50,148 --> 00:43:52,359
- Get up and give me a ride.
- All right.

464
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:55,488
- Get up! Get up there!
- All right.

465
00:44:00,576 --> 00:44:01,827
Oh, no, no.

466
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:20,763
Looks like we got us a sow here
instead of a boar.

467
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:24,350
Don't!

468
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:26,018
Don't!

469
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:31,733
What's the matter, boy?

470
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:33,819
I bet you squeal.

471
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:35,903
I bet you can squeal like a pig.

472
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:37,948
Let's squeal. Squeal now.

473
00:44:38,573 --> 00:44:39,658
Squeal.

474
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:41,368
Squeal.

475
00:44:41,451 --> 00:44:43,412
Squeal louder. Louder.

476
00:44:44,788 --> 00:44:45,872
Louder.

477
00:44:46,707 --> 00:44:47,792
Louder.

478
00:44:48,709 --> 00:44:49,960
Louder!

479
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:52,212
Louder! Get down now, boy!

480
00:44:54,673 --> 00:44:57,719
There, get them britches down.
That's that.

481
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:02,306
You can do better than that, boy.

482
00:45:02,389 --> 00:45:04,142
Come on, squeal. Squeal!

483
00:46:51,335 --> 00:46:53,171
What's you wanna do with him?

484
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:55,799
He got a real pretty mouth, ain't he?

485
00:46:57,425 --> 00:46:58,802
That's the truth.

486
00:47:05,142 --> 00:47:07,561
You're gonna do some prayin' for me, boy.

487
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:09,689
And you better pray good.

488
00:47:17,446 --> 00:47:19,532
Here, hold that on him.

489
00:47:36,341 --> 00:47:38,885
You better run, you son of a bitch!

490
00:48:52,169 --> 00:48:54,046
Can't we do anything for him?

491
00:48:55,464 --> 00:48:56,507
No.

492
00:48:56,966 --> 00:48:58,384
It's a center shot.

493
00:49:00,052 --> 00:49:02,138
I thought they'd surely kill us.

494
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:05,267
They would have.

495
00:49:07,852 --> 00:49:09,604
They would have for sure.

496
00:49:13,232 --> 00:49:14,985
What we gonna do with him?

497
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:21,033
There's not but one thing to do:

498
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,911
Take the body down to Aintry.

499
00:49:25,371 --> 00:49:28,749
Turn it over to the highway patrol.
Tell 'em what happened.

500
00:49:32,627 --> 00:49:34,796
Tell 'em what, exactly?

501
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:40,427
Just what happened.

502
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:44,891
This is justifiable homicide if anything is.

503
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:50,980
They were sexually assaulting
two members of our party at gunpoint.

504
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:55,193
Like you said, there was nothin' else
we could do.

505
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:57,655
Is he alive?

506
00:50:02,368 --> 00:50:03,494
Not now.

507
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,626
Well, let's get our heads together.

508
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:14,171
Come on, let's not do anything foolish.

509
00:50:19,718 --> 00:50:21,971
Anybody know anything about the law?

510
00:50:31,689 --> 00:50:33,357
I was on jury duty once.

511
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:39,239
It wasn't a murder trial.

512
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:42,492
Murder trial?

513
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,330
I don't know the technical word for it,
Drew, but I know this:

514
00:50:48,331 --> 00:50:52,502
You take this man and turn him over
to the sheriff, there'll be a trial all right.

515
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:53,878
Trial by jury.

516
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:58,008
So what?

517
00:50:59,592 --> 00:51:01,178
We killed a man, Drew.

518
00:51:02,138 --> 00:51:03,722
Shot him in the back.

519
00:51:04,764 --> 00:51:06,017
A mountain man.

520
00:51:07,268 --> 00:51:08,436
Cracker.

521
00:51:09,811 --> 00:51:11,897
Gives us somethin' to consider.

522
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,902
All right, consider it. We're listening.

523
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:21,074
Shit, all these people are related.

524
00:51:21,825 --> 00:51:24,243
I'll be damned if I'll come back
and stand trial...

525
00:51:24,327 --> 00:51:26,288
...with this man's aunt and uncle...

526
00:51:26,621 --> 00:51:29,623
...maybe his mama and his daddy
sittin' in the jury box.

527
00:51:30,458 --> 00:51:32,210
What do you think, Bobby?

528
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:44,139
How about you, Ed?

529
00:51:46,725 --> 00:51:48,894
I don't know. I really don't know.

530
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:52,649
Now you listen, Lewis.
I don't know what you got in mind...

531
00:51:53,316 --> 00:51:56,401
...but if you conceal this body,
you'll be charged with murder.

532
00:51:56,485 --> 00:51:57,904
That much law I do know.

533
00:52:03,242 --> 00:52:05,536
This ain't one of your fuckin' games!

534
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,832
You killed somebody!

535
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:11,834
There he is!

536
00:52:12,293 --> 00:52:13,629
I see him, Drew.

537
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,215
That's right, I killed somebody.

538
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:21,969
But you're wrong if you don't see this
as a game.

539
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:27,266
Now you listen, Ed!
Damn it, we can get out of this thing!

540
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:29,603
Without any questions asked!

541
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,815
We get connected up with that body
and the law...

542
00:52:33,856 --> 00:52:37,319
...this thing's gonna be hangin' over us
the rest of our lives.

543
00:52:38,195 --> 00:52:40,030
We gotta get rid of that guy.

544
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:44,159
Just how are you gonna do that, Lewis?
Where?

545
00:52:46,203 --> 00:52:47,371
Anywhere.

546
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:54,670
Everywhere.

547
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,138
Nowhere.

548
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,643
How do you know that other guy
hasn't already gone for the police?

549
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:12,897
What in the hell is
he gonna tell 'em, Drew?

550
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,733
What he did to Bobby?

551
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,618
Why couldn't he go get
some other mountain men?

552
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,912
Now why isn't he gonna do that?

553
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,415
You look around you, Lewis!

554
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,836
He could be out there anywhere,
watchin' us right now.

555
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:37,549
We ain't gonna be so goddamned
hard to follow, draggin' a corpse.

556
00:53:42,596 --> 00:53:44,722
You let me worry about that, Drew.

557
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,601
You let me take care of that.

558
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:52,188
You know what's gonna be here?
Right here. A lake.

559
00:53:52,773 --> 00:53:54,566
As far as you can see.

560
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:57,652
Hundreds of feet deep.

561
00:53:57,944 --> 00:53:59,571
Hundreds of feet deep.

562
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,284
Did you ever look over a lake...

563
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:07,120
...and think about somethin' buried
underneath it?

564
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,956
Buried underneath it!

565
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:14,253
Man, that's about as buried as you can get!

566
00:54:16,172 --> 00:54:19,801
Well, I am telling you, Lewis,
I don't want any part of it.

567
00:54:19,884 --> 00:54:21,678
Well, you are part of it!

568
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,973
It is a matter of the law!

569
00:54:26,683 --> 00:54:27,809
The law?

570
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:29,644
The law?

571
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,688
What law?

572
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:36,901
Where's the law, Drew?

573
00:54:41,281 --> 00:54:43,491
You believe in democracy, don't you?

574
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:46,537
Yes, I do.

575
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,372
Well, then, we'll take a vote.

576
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,712
I'll stand by it.

577
00:54:56,088 --> 00:54:57,506
So will you.

578
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:04,972
What do you say, Bobby?

579
00:55:05,973 --> 00:55:07,350
Let's bury him.

580
00:55:11,228 --> 00:55:13,356
I don't want this gettin' around.

581
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:14,857
Okay?

582
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:18,820
Okay?

583
00:55:20,947 --> 00:55:22,657
It's up to you, Ed.

584
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:24,868
It's all up to you, Ed.

585
00:55:35,211 --> 00:55:37,715
Now just think what you're doin', Ed.

586
00:55:38,174 --> 00:55:39,550
For God's sake.

587
00:55:41,217 --> 00:55:42,469
You got a wife.

588
00:55:43,054 --> 00:55:44,472
You got a child.

589
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:47,223
You're not involved in this.

590
00:55:48,684 --> 00:55:50,603
Think about your family, Ed.

591
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:54,315
This may be the most important decision
of your whole life, Ed.

592
00:55:54,607 --> 00:55:55,816
Yes!

593
00:55:57,318 --> 00:55:59,905
There's no way we can change this.

594
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:04,117
There's no way we can change
what happened to Bobby.

595
00:56:04,993 --> 00:56:06,411
We gotta do the right thing.

596
00:56:06,494 --> 00:56:08,788
We must live with it for the rest
of our lives.

597
00:56:08,871 --> 00:56:09,873
Right!

598
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:16,588
I'm with Lewis.

599
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:23,303
All right, let's get on with it, then.

600
01:00:23,344 --> 01:00:24,845
Lewis. Let's go.

601
01:00:25,804 --> 01:00:27,431
What's the plan, Lewis?

602
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,354
Plan?

603
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:37,942
We just paddle on down to Aintry,
get the cars and go home.

604
01:00:50,205 --> 01:00:52,081
Put your jacket on, Drew.

605
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,168
Drew!

606
01:00:59,965 --> 01:01:01,842
Put your life jacket on!

607
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,288
Drew, paddle! Drew!

608
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:47,931
Drew?

609
01:01:49,307 --> 01:01:50,934
Drew, what's the matter?

610
01:01:52,644 --> 01:01:54,521
Lewis, somethin's wrong. To the side.

611
01:01:54,605 --> 01:01:55,856
Something's wrong!

612
01:01:55,981 --> 01:01:57,441
No! Go on!

613
01:01:57,816 --> 01:01:59,443
What is it?

614
01:02:00,402 --> 01:02:01,780
Don't stop, Ed!

615
01:02:01,987 --> 01:02:04,573
- I'm gonna pull in.
- Go! Go!

616
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,786
What happened?

617
01:02:08,911 --> 01:02:10,287
Look out!

618
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:31,225
Where's Drew?

619
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:34,479
My leg's broke.

620
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:39,109
Where's Drew?

621
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:42,404
I'm takin' roll call!

622
01:04:49,662 --> 01:04:50,912
Drew was shot!

623
01:04:53,206 --> 01:04:54,917
Somethin' happened to him.

624
01:04:56,168 --> 01:04:57,335
What?

625
01:04:58,169 --> 01:04:59,547
Drew was shot.

626
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,133
Shot?

627
01:05:18,816 --> 01:05:20,193
Here, here.

628
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:23,320
Hold him here.

629
01:05:23,446 --> 01:05:25,240
- I got him.
- Hold on!

630
01:05:30,871 --> 01:05:32,247
Drew was shot!

631
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:35,042
Bobby, Drew was shot!

632
01:06:32,434 --> 01:06:33,894
He was shot, Bobby!

633
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,397
Drew was shot!

634
01:06:38,775 --> 01:06:40,401
Here's his jacket!

635
01:06:41,694 --> 01:06:43,320
He wasn't wearin' it!

636
01:06:51,788 --> 01:06:53,414
Maybe Lewis is right!

637
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:56,459
Of course, he's right. Of course!

638
01:07:00,922 --> 01:07:03,216
You mean that other guy shot him?

639
01:07:03,633 --> 01:07:04,719
Did he?

640
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:06,344
Did you see him?

641
01:07:06,594 --> 01:07:08,138
Drew was shot.

642
01:07:10,391 --> 01:07:13,143
Lewis says that other guy...

643
01:07:14,019 --> 01:07:16,605
...that toothless bastard, shot him!

644
01:07:19,274 --> 01:07:20,901
He's right up there!

645
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:33,247
He's gonna try and kill us, too!

646
01:07:34,165 --> 01:07:35,708
If he killed Drew...

647
01:07:36,626 --> 01:07:38,502
...he's gonna have to kill us!

648
01:07:45,092 --> 01:07:46,970
Lewis, I'll tell you what.

649
01:07:49,514 --> 01:07:53,560
We'll wait until dark, and we'll put you
in the bottom of the canoe...

650
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:55,812
...and we'll sneak out of here.

651
01:07:57,022 --> 01:08:00,025
- Okay, Ed?
- Bobby, look at those rapids down there!

652
01:08:00,233 --> 01:08:02,277
- Look at those rapids!
- Christ!

653
01:08:04,029 --> 01:08:06,698
We can't move out of here in the dark.

654
01:08:10,744 --> 01:08:12,704
We're not gonna move you, Lewis.

655
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,376
Lewis, we're trapped in this gorge.

656
01:08:22,465 --> 01:08:24,092
What're we gonna do, Lewis?

657
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:27,470
You're the guy with the answers.
What the hell do we do now?

658
01:08:30,598 --> 01:08:33,601
Now you get to play the game.

659
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,023
You're ruined! Lewis, you're ruined!

660
01:08:49,743 --> 01:08:50,577
Listen.

661
01:08:51,036 --> 01:08:52,663
He's hurt bad, isn't he?

662
01:08:53,622 --> 01:08:55,083
What're we gonna do?

663
01:08:56,834 --> 01:08:59,211
The guy must know exactly where we are.

664
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:04,758
Well, if he knows where we are...

665
01:09:07,053 --> 01:09:09,722
...then we sure as hell know
where he's gonna be.

666
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:13,518
Right up there.

667
01:10:48,574 --> 01:10:49,659
Christ!

668
01:10:50,577 --> 01:10:51,953
What a view!

669
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:19,231
Goddamn it!

670
01:11:19,815 --> 01:11:22,235
You'll never get out of this gorge alive!

671
01:11:22,986 --> 01:11:24,445
Goddamn it!

672
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:34,956
Pull yourself together.

673
01:15:27,613 --> 01:15:28,741
Release.

674
01:21:41,418 --> 01:21:42,961
I don't believe it!

675
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:45,421
You did it, Ed.

676
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:48,341
You killed him!

677
01:21:48,842 --> 01:21:49,968
Good.

678
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:55,557
Lewis had a bad night.
More than once I thought he'd die.

679
01:22:02,106 --> 01:22:03,649
You did it, Ed. Good.

680
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:07,278
You sure it's him?

681
01:22:09,322 --> 01:22:11,365
That's the guy with the gun, huh?

682
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:13,701
I think so.

683
01:22:15,828 --> 01:22:17,955
He wasn't just some guy...

684
01:22:18,664 --> 01:22:21,501
...up there huntin' or something?
- You tell me!

685
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:18,331
Was he shot?

686
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:25,630
What about here? What about right there?

687
01:24:25,797 --> 01:24:27,255
Could have been a rock.

688
01:24:37,266 --> 01:24:39,310
What are you gonna do with Drew?

689
01:24:40,978 --> 01:24:44,148
If a bullet made this,
there are people who can tell.

690
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:48,194
Oh, God!

691
01:24:49,195 --> 01:24:50,656
There's no end to it.

692
01:25:33,825 --> 01:25:35,535
I didn't really know him.

693
01:25:39,372 --> 01:25:40,457
Drew was...

694
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,044
...a good husband...

695
01:25:44,169 --> 01:25:45,712
...to his wife Linda.

696
01:25:50,008 --> 01:25:52,845
You're a wonderful father
to your boys, Drew...

697
01:25:55,181 --> 01:25:57,057
...Jimmy and Billy Ray.

698
01:25:59,143 --> 01:26:00,436
And if...

699
01:26:01,812 --> 01:26:04,190
...we come through this, I promise...

700
01:26:05,066 --> 01:26:06,859
...to do all I can for 'em.

701
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,037
He was the best of us.

702
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:20,957
Amen.

703
01:27:16,515 --> 01:27:18,892
Christ! Look at that! God help us.

704
01:29:31,195 --> 01:29:33,866
We made it. We made it, Ed.

705
01:29:37,034 --> 01:29:38,412
We made it.

706
01:29:40,205 --> 01:29:42,082
- We're back, Ed!
- Yeah.

707
01:29:45,419 --> 01:29:47,796
- We gotta get Lewis to a doctor.
- Right, Ed.

708
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:49,715
Gotta get Lewis to a doctor.

709
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:55,471
We're back! We made it!

710
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,056
Everything happened...

711
01:29:57,181 --> 01:29:59,309
Listen, everything happened right here.

712
01:29:59,392 --> 01:30:01,352
Everything happened right here.

713
01:30:01,853 --> 01:30:04,397
Lewis broke his leg in those rapids there.

714
01:30:04,522 --> 01:30:07,192
- And Drew drowned here. In this place.
- No, no, Ed.

715
01:30:07,275 --> 01:30:10,278
- No, nothin' happened here.
- Bobby, listen to me!

716
01:30:10,487 --> 01:30:12,697
We got to stop them from lookin' upriver.

717
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:15,784
It's important that we get together
on this thing.

718
01:30:16,201 --> 01:30:17,494
You understand?

719
01:30:19,162 --> 01:30:21,915
I understand, Eddie, I understand.

720
01:30:22,165 --> 01:30:24,709
That's right, Lewis. That's our story.

721
01:30:24,834 --> 01:30:26,295
Lewis, we're back.

722
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:34,178
- It's all right.
- Get Lewis to a doctor.

723
01:30:34,636 --> 01:30:35,805
All right, Ed.

724
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:38,849
All right.

725
01:30:41,685 --> 01:30:44,355
We'll find a place to put it.

726
01:30:46,942 --> 01:30:48,401
We're not out of this yet!

727
01:33:25,188 --> 01:33:26,898
They brought the cars.

728
01:33:34,699 --> 01:33:36,491
You come for the cars, sir?

729
01:33:38,034 --> 01:33:39,119
Yes.

730
01:33:43,206 --> 01:33:44,751
Do you have a phone?

731
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:46,043
Phone?

732
01:33:47,253 --> 01:33:48,336
Telephone?

733
01:33:48,879 --> 01:33:50,048
Yes, sir.

734
01:33:53,634 --> 01:33:55,344
You're gonna be all right.

735
01:33:56,054 --> 01:33:58,347
What in the world happened to you guys?

736
01:33:59,057 --> 01:34:00,350
Drew Ballinger.

737
01:34:03,394 --> 01:34:04,854
Did you look for him?

738
01:34:04,937 --> 01:34:06,190
A long time.

739
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,316
Could you show us where it happened?

740
01:34:20,995 --> 01:34:23,916
How'd you manage to shoot yourself
with your own arrow?

741
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:26,960
Didn't think it could be done.

742
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:29,588
This is nice.

743
01:34:31,131 --> 01:34:32,384
What's that?

744
01:34:38,473 --> 01:34:40,432
Chromium, paper tissues...

745
01:34:42,101 --> 01:34:43,728
...hot water... That's nice.

746
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,106
You fallin' asleep?

747
01:34:48,525 --> 01:34:51,361
Don't forget to phone your wife.
Let her know how you are.

748
01:34:51,486 --> 01:34:53,696
Yes, I will, thank you.

749
01:35:19,306 --> 01:35:21,016
Hello. Come on in.

750
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:28,149
We saved you a seat.

751
01:35:35,991 --> 01:35:38,117
Do you feel like eating something?

752
01:35:39,702 --> 01:35:40,829
Please.

753
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:46,001
Some corn?

754
01:36:02,643 --> 01:36:04,352
Would you like some peas?

755
01:36:34,259 --> 01:36:36,135
This corn is special, isn't it?

756
01:36:37,136 --> 01:36:38,764
I love good corn.

757
01:36:40,057 --> 01:36:43,227
We need that cucumber
I got out of the garden last night.

758
01:36:44,395 --> 01:36:45,771
You know how long it was?

759
01:36:45,896 --> 01:36:48,733
- Tell me.
- Twelve-and-a-half inches long.

760
01:36:50,067 --> 01:36:54,030
Then I measured it around,
and it's ten-and-a-half around.

761
01:36:54,989 --> 01:36:57,741
That's the darndest lookin' cucumber
you'll ever see.

762
01:37:00,954 --> 01:37:04,541
I tell you, I'll send it over
and let you see it, if you doubt it.

763
01:37:06,126 --> 01:37:08,419
I think you're crazy sometimes.

764
01:37:13,758 --> 01:37:15,301
<i>We can show you the place.</i>

765
01:37:15,427 --> 01:37:17,887
<i>Now I know where you told me it was.</i>

766
01:37:20,641 --> 01:37:22,267
<i>We just wanna cooperate.</i>

767
01:37:23,518 --> 01:37:26,188
<i>You recognize that piece of canoe?</i>

768
01:37:27,106 --> 01:37:29,315
<i>Now, we lost one. That could be it.</i>

769
01:37:29,441 --> 01:37:30,526
<i>But you ain't sure?</i>

770
01:37:30,609 --> 01:37:33,195
<i>Yeah, I think so, but it's kind of confusing.</i>

771
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:35,698
<i>I'd think you'd recognize your own canoe.</i>

772
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:46,001
I'd appreciate it if you'd show me
that spot.

773
01:38:06,521 --> 01:38:09,357
Ed, we're in trouble. They don't believe us!

774
01:38:12,862 --> 01:38:14,654
What did you tell him, Bobby?

775
01:38:16,073 --> 01:38:17,617
What we agreed on.

776
01:38:19,534 --> 01:38:21,828
I heard you. I was in that room, Bobby.

777
01:38:24,082 --> 01:38:25,541
What did you tell him?

778
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:30,004
They found part of the green canoe, right?

779
01:38:30,129 --> 01:38:32,006
Upstream, and you got scared.

780
01:38:32,881 --> 01:38:34,842
Didn't you, Bobby? I know you.

781
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,054
You told him the truth, didn't you, Bobby?

782
01:38:38,137 --> 01:38:40,598
- You told him the truth!
- I didn't do that!

783
01:38:46,562 --> 01:38:47,730
I told 'em...

784
01:38:48,982 --> 01:38:50,275
...like we said.

785
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:53,820
But I don't think they believed me.

786
01:38:55,948 --> 01:38:58,408
Ed, I think they found that other canoe...

787
01:38:58,908 --> 01:39:01,412
...upstream, above where we told him.

788
01:39:08,419 --> 01:39:09,796
I never said that.

789
01:39:10,588 --> 01:39:11,964
Yes, you did.

790
01:39:13,424 --> 01:39:16,010
- No, I didn't.
- I know damn well you did.

791
01:39:17,595 --> 01:39:18,721
I know what I said.

792
01:39:18,846 --> 01:39:21,057
Yeah, well, that's a goddamn lie.

793
01:39:21,641 --> 01:39:24,560
Sheriff, that ain't what he said
this morning.

794
01:39:25,310 --> 01:39:28,064
You tell me how a canoe can drift upriver.

795
01:39:31,192 --> 01:39:32,652
Now what about this?

796
01:39:34,612 --> 01:39:35,905
Look, Sheriff...

797
01:39:36,657 --> 01:39:38,616
...we been through quite a lot.

798
01:39:39,242 --> 01:39:41,829
I don't know what's wrong
with your man there.

799
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,415
Mr. Queen's got a brother-in-law...

800
01:39:46,459 --> 01:39:48,419
...back up in there somewhere.

801
01:39:48,961 --> 01:39:51,504
He took off huntin' three days ago and...

802
01:39:52,757 --> 01:39:55,050
...nobody's heard from him since.

803
01:39:56,302 --> 01:39:58,512
Mr. Queen thought maybe you all...

804
01:39:58,637 --> 01:40:01,015
...might've happened up on him
somewhere.

805
01:40:01,724 --> 01:40:03,017
Well, we didn't.

806
01:40:04,351 --> 01:40:06,937
Don't let 'em go. These boys is lying.

807
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:12,694
We got nothin' to hold 'em for.

808
01:40:13,028 --> 01:40:14,571
We don't have a thing.

809
01:40:21,912 --> 01:40:25,540
Let's just wait and see
what comes out of the river.

810
01:40:40,723 --> 01:40:42,766
That there's the town hall.

811
01:40:43,850 --> 01:40:46,229
Right over there's the old fire station.

812
01:40:46,437 --> 01:40:49,189
Played a lot of checkers over there.

813
01:40:51,025 --> 01:40:53,945
All this land's gonna be covered
with water.

814
01:40:54,237 --> 01:40:56,989
Best thing that ever happened
to this town.

815
01:41:05,749 --> 01:41:10,379
We may have to stop just a minute
for the church to get out of the way.

816
01:41:18,512 --> 01:41:19,680
Christ.

817
01:41:33,694 --> 01:41:35,237
Doctor, how's our boy?

818
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:37,782
We're doin' everything we can for him.

819
01:41:37,866 --> 01:41:41,535
But there's a chance he might lose the leg,
so take it easy on him, okay?

820
01:41:41,660 --> 01:41:43,371
I'll talk with you later.

821
01:41:50,462 --> 01:41:51,546
Officer?

822
01:41:54,632 --> 01:41:56,259
Has he been awake yet?

823
01:41:56,342 --> 01:41:59,096
No, we're still waitin' for him
to come around.

824
01:42:08,939 --> 01:42:11,484
Lewis, listen, we had to change our story.

825
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:24,247
How you feeling?

826
01:42:25,539 --> 01:42:26,916
Never better.

827
01:42:33,881 --> 01:42:35,258
Did you hear me?

828
01:42:36,218 --> 01:42:38,719
What happened on that last set of rapids?

829
01:42:40,263 --> 01:42:41,973
I don't remember nothing.

830
01:42:44,392 --> 01:42:45,435
Nothing.

831
01:42:57,823 --> 01:43:00,117
- Want me to drive Drew's car back?
- No.

832
01:43:00,283 --> 01:43:01,536
Talk to his wife?

833
01:43:01,661 --> 01:43:03,621
I'll do it, Bobby, thank you.

834
01:43:22,182 --> 01:43:24,058
You all about ready to leave?

835
01:43:24,142 --> 01:43:25,143
Yeah.

836
01:43:29,731 --> 01:43:33,652
The Griner boys brought these cars
down to you from Orie, is that right?

837
01:43:34,236 --> 01:43:35,237
Right.

838
01:43:39,366 --> 01:43:42,119
You happen to see another man
with 'em up there?

839
01:43:45,456 --> 01:43:47,249
There was someone, wasn't there?

840
01:43:47,374 --> 01:43:48,918
I think so, yes.

841
01:44:03,140 --> 01:44:06,144
Before you go, buddy,
let me ask you something.

842
01:44:10,023 --> 01:44:12,859
How come you all ended up
with four life jackets?

843
01:44:13,735 --> 01:44:15,528
Didn't we have an extra one?

844
01:44:18,073 --> 01:44:19,200
No.

845
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:23,620
Drew wasn't wearin' his.

846
01:44:25,247 --> 01:44:27,999
Well, how come he wasn't wearin' it?

847
01:44:32,922 --> 01:44:34,090
I don't know.

848
01:44:43,599 --> 01:44:46,061
Don't ever do nothin' like this again.

849
01:44:49,605 --> 01:44:51,233
Don't come back up here.

850
01:44:52,401 --> 01:44:54,902
You don't have to worry
about that, Sheriff.

851
01:44:57,614 --> 01:45:00,950
I'd kinda like to see this town die peaceful.

852
01:45:03,537 --> 01:45:06,081
I hope Deputy Queen
finds his brother-in-law.

853
01:45:08,834 --> 01:45:10,794
He'll come in drunk probably.

854
01:45:52,545 --> 01:45:53,797
Good-bye, Ed.

855
01:45:54,089 --> 01:45:55,299
'Bye, Bobby.

856
01:45:55,883 --> 01:45:58,135
I don't think I'll see you for a while.

857
01:47:20,053 --> 01:47:21,346
Hey, Charlie.

858
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:25,267
What you got there, guy?

859
01:47:43,452 --> 01:47:45,246
What's the matter?

860
01:47:47,457 --> 01:47:48,915
It's all right.

861
01:47:49,792 --> 01:47:51,085
It's all right.

862
01:47:53,796 --> 01:47:54,922
Go to sleep.

863
01:47:57,800 --> 01:47:58,926
Go to sleep.

864
01:47:59,305 --> 01:48:05,340
