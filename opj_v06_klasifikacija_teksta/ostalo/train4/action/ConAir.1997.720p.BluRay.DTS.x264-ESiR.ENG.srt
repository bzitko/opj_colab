Army Rangers have a proud history.

3
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,070
Since the 1700s, Rangers have led
the way in every major confrontation...

4
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,120
in which the United States
has been involved.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,540
You men are a credit to that fine
heritage, and I'm sorry to see you go.

6
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,620
But you've served your country well,
and you've displayed the ability
to fight on...

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,960
to the Ranger objective
and complete its mission:

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,090
never leaving behind a fallen comrade
no matter what the odds or the enemy.

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,800
I thank you.

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,180
America thanks you.

11
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,140
And I wish you luck wherever you go.

12
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,890
And remember, Rangers lead the way.

13
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,150
- Hi, Tricia.
- Hey.

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,820
- Hey, Tricia Poe.
- Hello, Dale.

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,290
How do I

16
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,830
Get through one night
without you

17
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,670
If I had to live
without you

18
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,970
What kind of life
would that be

19
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,510
Oh, I

20
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,350
I need you in my arms
Need you to hold

21
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,350
- Hummingbird.
- Hi.

22
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,680
- You're my world, my heart and soul
- Look at you.

23
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,690
I'd take a beatin' half my life
to get a piece of that woman.

24
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,980
- How's my baby?
- She's doin' fine.

25
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,530
- Baby, you would take away everything
- Yeah?

26
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,990
- Good in my life
- What? You're kidding me!

27
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,070
- What?
- Sweetie?

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,580
Hey, shh. Can't you see I'm in
the middle of somethin' here? What?

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,250
- How do I live without you
- You, you gonna be Miss Alabama?

30
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,750
Well, that makes your daddy
very proud.

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:14,420
Oh, I know
How do I breathe without you

32
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,420
if you ever go

33
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,720
Tricia Poe!
You little angel, you.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,470
Hey, how about joinin' me
and the boys for a cold one?

35
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,390
- Huh, darlin'?
- No, thanks.

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,390
Who's your
Captain Huckleberry here?

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,770
-You know this gentleman, honey?
-He's a regular.

38
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,110
Yeah, I'm a regular.
Huh. Regular hound dog.

39
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,030
This is a special occasion, and
if you don't mind, I'd like to
spend it dancin' with my wife.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,620
Tell you what, soldier Dick. Why don't
you go buy me and my buddies a round?

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,710
Hey, Cameron, no.
it ain't worth it.

42
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,130
Hey. Come on, Daddy.
Let's dance.

43
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,380
Oh, chickenshit!

44
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,720
'Cause of pussies like you,
we lost Vietnam. I'll tell ya that.

45
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,640
- We don't need trouble.
- Oh, you should be so proud.

46
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,640
You know, for a second there
you were that guy again.

47
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,440
I know it.

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,030
Well, I was hopin' maybe the army
would make that guy grow up.

49
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,780
Well--

50
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,160
- He has.
- Then tell me now

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,410
How do I live
without you

52
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,370
I want to know

53
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,710
How do I breathe
without you

54
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,340
if you ever go

55
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,180
Hey, Gomer!

56
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,940
Thought you might need a little help
escortin' your old lady home.

57
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,530
Cameron, let's go home.
Just get in the car.

58
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,360
- Come on.
- Cameron!

59
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,820
Cameron, get in the car!

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,330
Dale! Dale!

61
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
Take this,
you son of a bitch!

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,400
Tricia!

63
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,530
Tricia!

64
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,750
God, he's dead.
Cameron, this guy's dead.

65
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,250
Admit the facts,
and enter a plea bargain.

66
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,300
I will not plead guilty.

67
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,590
You could get ten years.

68
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,600
Admit to it,
you get four.

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,230
Serve maybe a year.

70
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:19,730
Cameron Poe, you have pleaded guilty
to manslaughter in the first degree.

71
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,730
With your military skills,
you are a deadly weapon...

72
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,030
and are not subject to the same laws
as other people that are provoked...

73
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,620
because you can respond
with deadly force.

74
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,830
it is the order of this court that you
be remanded to a federal penitentiary...

75
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,170
where you shall remain incarcerated
for a term not less than 7 to 10 years.

76

"Con Air"
action-thriller, USA, 1997

77
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,140
Hello, pretty girl.

78
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,470
Come, come. Bring it here. Hey! Hey!

79
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,690
Dearest Tricia, I think of you always.
Your smile, your laugh.

80
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,650
I'm not angry. The blame's
gotta fall on me.

81
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,360
I am, however, torn apart
when I think that I won't...

82
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,030
be there to see our child
come into the world...

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
cradled in your arms,
and her first smile.

84
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,210
I got your package.
Those pink coconut things...

85
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,670
have made me quite popular.

86
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,630
Met a guy just the other day.
Baby-O. He sure does love 'em.

87
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,180
And now our daughter, beautiful Casey.

88
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,680
I watch her grow
in the pictures you send.

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,520
I showed 'em to Baby-O.
His reaction was simple.

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,190
He said, "Thank God
she looks like her mama.'

91
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,690
I'd have to agree.

92
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,480
It's funny, but here I am in maybe
the worst place on earth, and yet...

93
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,030
somehow I feel like
the luckiest man alive.

94
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,660
Dear Daddy, I started today at
the Little Sunshine Day Care Center.

95
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,670
My teacher is Miss Gordon. She is nice.

96
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,170
We go to playtime, and we all have
to hold hands when we walk there.

97
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,420
Dear Casey, it was so good
to read your letter.

98
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,510
I'm glad you like your teacher.

99
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,050
We don't exactly have
a playtime like you.

100
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,520
We do go outside, though. But
normally, we don't hold hands.

101
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,230
My wife and I will have
our Margaritas on the yacht.

102
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,410
Dear Daddy, today was
my first day at first grade.

103
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,540
I didn't like it. I don't want
to go back tomorrow.

104
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,130
This boy, Scotty Dalton, has
black teeth and calls me names.

105
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,090
Mama says I have to go back.
Tell her not to make me.

106
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,930
Dear Casey, hopefully this finds you
still goin' to the first grade.

107
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,260
School is very important.
Your mama's right.

108
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,480
Now, don't you worry
about little Scotty Dalton.

109
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Sometimes you meet people like that,
but don't let 'em get you down.

110
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,110
Dear Daddy, are you ever comin' home?

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
Dear Casey, of course I'm comin' home.

112
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,620
ln just a little while longer, and all
the things we missed doin' together...

113
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,750
you can be sure we'll do.

114
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:26,290
Dear Hummingbird, break out
the fine china, chill the lemonade...

115
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,630
tie a yellow ribbon
'round the old oak tree...

116
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,630
'cause this boy's comin' home to
his ladies, comin' home forever.

117
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,260
I just hope I'm not a disappointment
to Casey or to you.

118
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,180
Love, Cameron.

119
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,520
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

120
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,520
My birthday
is July 14th.

121
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:51,030
I'm going see my daddy for the first
time ever on July 14th.""

122
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,820
I can't wait to meet you, honey. lsn't
that the cutest thing you ever heard?

123
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,990
Yeah, man.

124
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,160
Hey, now,
what is this?

125
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,420
I can't see my little daughter
on her birthday without bringin'
her a gift, now can I?

126
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,880
Yeah, man,
but that's a bunny rabbit.

127
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,250
That's all right. I mean,
she'll like it, right? I mean, what?

128
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,840
it's either this or a tube
of toothpaste and two packs
of Pall Malls at the canteen.

129
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,930
- Now, that's a present.
- I'll remember that on your birthday.

130
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:21,310
Yeah, you do that, man.

131
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,980
'it having been made to appear to
the United States Parole Commission...

132
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,940
Cameron Poe is eligible
to be paroled.'

133
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:37,870
Shit, might be a long time before I see
somethin' like that with my name on it.

134
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,330
- You'll get your own date
someday, Baby-O.
- I ain't worried about that, man.

135
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,010
Yeah, but like at this new prison you're
goin' to, who's gonna watch your back?

136
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,300
God's got my back.
You know what I'm sayin'?

137
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm goin' home, son!

138
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,390
Wait, don't be gettin' all juicy
on me, all right? Get off me.

139
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,190
Step out.

140
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,570
Good-bye. Good night.

141
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,370
The U.S. Marshal Service
annually flies...

142
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,710
155,000 prisoners
around the country...

143
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,830
for transfers, legal hearings
and medical exams.

144
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,920
As you know, today's flight
is a special one.

145
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,380
We're populating Alabama's
Feltham Penitentiary...

146
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,510
the newest super-max facility
in the system.

147
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,850
This place was designed
to warehouse the worst of the worst.

148
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,770
Now, most of these guys
are lifers, some on death row.

149
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,860
Pure predators,
each and every one of them.

150
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,570
- Hey, lady!
- Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie.

151
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,110
My name is Bishop.
Guard Bishop to you.

152
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,740
Well, I gotta be gettin' my shot
before we go gettin' on
some airplane, Guard Bishop.

153
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,080
- What's your name?
- Odell. They didn't give me
my shot last night.

154
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,960
Okay, you're diabetic? All
right, your insulin's on board.
We'll give it to you in flight.

155
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,130
- Cameron Poe.
- Yes, ma'am.

156
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,050
You know you're still under full
restraints till you're processed...

157
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,260
and released from your original
prison, understand?

158
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,600
Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home
on time, it makes no never mind.

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,470
- it's my daughter's birthday.
- Well, congratulations.

160
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,560
I got locked down three months before
she was born. She ain't never seen me.

161
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,020
- And why not?
- No way was she gonna meet her daddy...

162
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,820
in a prison visitor room
surrounded by homemade cookies and...

163
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,450
and love-starved murderers.

164
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,910
- No way.
- What you got here is a walking,
talking reason to rehabilitate.

165
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,460
So today let's exemplify
our three operative words:

166
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,750
firm, fair and vigilant.

167
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,630
Now, let's go to work.

168
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,180
We off-load six in Carson City,
the rest are sheeted to Feltham.

169
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,470
Good. Let's go deal
with the DEA boys.

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,310
- You know this guy?
- Haven't had the pleasure.

171
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,640
He's a piece of work,
a real piece of work.

172
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,110
Duncan, good to see you.
She sure is beautiful.

173
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:20,820
Hey, beautiful? Sunsets are beautiful.
Newborn babies are beautiful.

174
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,950
This, this is
fucking spectacular!

175
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,160
Duncan, this is Vince Larkin.
He's overseeing the transpo.

176
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,330
Vince,
Duncan Malloy, DEA.

177
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,120
Nice to meet ya. I'm sure
we're gonna have a good time
working on this together.

178
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,180
- Hey, Willie.
- Boys!
- How ya doin'?
- What's up, Chief?

179
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,770
- You know each other?
- Vince Larkin.
- Sims, DEA. Good to meet you, Larkin.

180
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,770
This is our file on your man,
Francisco Cindino, son of Eduardo...

181
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,440
prime mover of narcotics
from Colombia.

182
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:01,610
it's gonna be
an all-star flight.

183
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:04,280
This kid's a potential fountain of
information about the family business.

184
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,410
- Eleven and a half okay?
- Yeah.

185
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,740
Look at him.
Nice college boy, right?

186
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,790
We interrogated him for months.
He gave up nothing.

187
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,040
This is our last chance
before the FBl gets him.

188
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,170
Over my dead body
those assholes get the glory.

189
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,580
We pick up Mr Cindino
in Carson City.

190
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,550
From then until the plane hits Alabama,
we've got two hours to get him to talk.

191
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,550
We got you a seat right next
to him, and he's known to be...

192
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,470
somewhat garrulous
in the company of thieves.

193
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,590
Garrulous?
What the fuck is garrulous?

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,600
That would be loquacious, verbose,
effusive. How about "chatty"?

195
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,600
What's with dictionary boy,
here?

196
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,690
Thesaurus boy, I think,
is more appropriate.

197
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,860
- You got your gun?
- Yeah.

198
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,690
- Whoa, whoa. Gun?
- We got rules, gentlemen.

199
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,150
- Yeah. So do we. Our agents go armed.
- No one carries on this flight.

200
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,490
I've got a small arsenal
in the belly of the plane.

201
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,450
A pistol in the cockpit
lockbox. That's it.

202
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,450
Other than that, we keep
the plane like a prison.

203
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
No weapon
on the aircraft, period.

204
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,210
My man does not get on
that plane without his gun.

205
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,710
Then your man
doesn't get on the plane.

206
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,340
Okay, Willie,
give it to him.

207
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,630
Give him the gun.

208
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,350
- Avoid eye contact.
- I got it.

209
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,360
- ln the pen, it's a sign of aggression.
- Larkin, I got it.

210
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay.

211
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,150
Foxtrot Charlie,
we are ready to disembark.

212
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,700
Waiting your go
on separatee transfer.

213
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,490
Well, we told you today's flight
would be special.

214
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,000
- That's William Bedford,
aka "Billy Bedlam.'
- The mass murderer?

215
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,330
The same. He caught his wife in bed
with another man. Left her alone.

216
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Drove four towns over
to his wife's family's house.

217
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,760
Killed her parents, her brothers, her
sisters, even her dog.

218
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,550
Scan him.

219
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,090
And who is that
good-looking brother on screen?

220
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,100
Nathan Jones,
aka "Diamond Dog.'

221
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,560
Former general of
the Black Guerrillas.

222
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,020
He blew up a meeting of the National
Rifle Association saying...

223
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,730
and I quote, "They represented the
basest negativity of the white race.'

224
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,860
He wrote a book in prison called
Reflections ln A Diamond Eye.

225
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,450
New York Times called it "A wake-up
call for the black community.'

226
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,200
They're talking to Denzel
for the movie.

227
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:23,710
Close door number one.

228
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
This one's done it all.
Kidnapping...

229
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,880
robbery, murder,
extortion.

230
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,260
Foxtrot Charlie, perimeter is secured.
You are cleared to release.

231
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,770
His name is Cyrus Grissom,
aka "Cyrus the Virus.'

232
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,270
Thirty-nine years old,
25 of them spent in our institutions.

233
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,110
But he's bettered himself inside. Earned
two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.

234
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,990
He also killed 11 fellow inmates,
incited three riots and escaped twice.

235
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:55,530
Likes to brag that he killed
more men than cancer.

236
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,370
Okay, open wide.

237
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,290
Lift your tongue.

238
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,340
Cyrus is a poster child
for the criminally insane. He's
a true product of the system.

239
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,420
What's that supposed to mean? Uh, what
is he, one of these sociology majors...

240
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,970
who thinks we're responsible
for breeding these animals?

241
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,140
No, but I could point a few fingers
if it would make you feel comfortable.

242
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,780
Ah, look at this walking penis.
Boy, you are one skinny Negro.

243
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,200
- Easy man. Shit.
- Open up.

244
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,700
Oh, man, it smells like
somebody shit in your mouth.

245
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,700
He told me he loved me.

246
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,620
- Get out of my face.
- All right, all right. Shit.

247
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,000
- Hey, Larkin, who's that guy?
- That is Cameron Poe.

248
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:50,550
A parolee hitchin' a ride home.
He's a nobody.

249
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,590
Okay, let's do it.

250
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,890
Willie, nobody on the plane knows
your classification, not even my guards.

251
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,890
- Guard Bishop.
- Hey, Larkin.

252
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,020
Tell me, Skip, is
the U.S. Marshal Service...

253
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,060
in the habit of employing
annoying, wiseass bookworm creeps?

254
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,770
Larkin's one of the best
we got.

255
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,320
Yeah, well, I'd still like to
crush his larynx with my boot.

256
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,450
Scan him.

257
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,240
Face me.

258
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,080
- What's this shit?
- it's my daughter.

259
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,880
I don't care if it's
the weepin' mama of Christ.

260
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,960
There's no personal possessions
on this airplane.

261
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,510
Just as long as you know I'll be
gettin' that back at some point.

262
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,430
Are you tellin' me what I'm
gonna be doin' here, numb-nuts?

263
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,430
- You heard me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

264
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,430
Come on,
break it up.

265
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,730
Oh, now, look at this fashion statement.
The do-rag gotta go, homeboy.

266
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,940
- Right here.
- Attention, officers.

267
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,900
- Final check, all restraints.
- Sweet bird of freedom.

268
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,120
Take off
in three minutes.

269
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,450
What's up, man?
Oh, shit. What's up?

270
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,910
I thought you was someone else.
Pinball Parker.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,500
Armed robber, arsonist, dope fiend. I'm
a hell of a nice guy. I just got caught.

272
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,670
Aw, shucks.

273
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,010
- All right, face me.
- I got him.

274
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,140
Come on.

275
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,140
Open.

276
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
You guys are late
for the party.

277
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,660
- Okay.
- Let's go, sweetheart.

278
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,370
What's up, Cochise?

279
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,710
How?

280
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,130
Hey, man, I'm just fuckin' with you,
all right? Don't get all...

281
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,090
"Wounded Knee" on me
and shit.

282
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,090
You look like
you wanna scalp a nigger.

283
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,180
What you lookin' at,
punk?

284
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:06,890
Nothin'. I was just
admirin' your cage.

285
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,890
Fits you pretty good.

286
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,690
Well, welcome aboard.

287
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,400
My, my. As I look around I see
a lot of celebrities among us.

288
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,530
I see 11 Current Affairs,
two Hard Copies, and a genuine
Geraldo interviewee.

289
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,950
But I got to tell you,
gentlemen, none of this impresses me.

290
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,200
Because we have rules on this aircraft,
and they're gonna be enforced.

291
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,830
it's a lot like kindergarten.
You'll keep your hands to yourself.

292
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,710
You keep the decibel level down.
And if any of you should feel
the need to scream...

293
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:36,550
spit or bite,
you get the treatment.

294
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,590
- Fuck you, pig.
- Gag and bag this Nazi muffin.

295
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,720
See, this kind of thing
puts me in a foul mood.

296
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:48,020
These rules will be enforced.
if there's a hint of trouble...

297
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,350
if any of you so much as passes
gas in my direction, it offends
my delicate nasal passages...

298
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,940
your testicles will become
my personal property.

299
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,650
That's pretty clear.
Good.

300
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,800
Call me Johnny 600
if they knew the truth.

301
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,510
Ah, doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

302
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,270
Anyway,
I despise rapists.

303
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,230
For me, you're somewhere between
a cockroach and that white stuff...

304
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,690
that accumulates at the corner of
your mouth when you're really thirsty.

305
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,400
But in your case,
I'll make an exception.

306
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,950
- Guard Falzon.
- What?

307
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:47,450
Oh, stewardess, stewardess?
What's the in-flight movie today?

308
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,200
Well, I think you'll like it,
Cyrus. it's called...

309
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,580
I'll Never Make Love
To A Woman On The Beach Again.

310
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,250
And it's preceded by the award-winning
short, No More Steak For Me Ever.

311
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,550
Funny fucker,
aren't ya?

312
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:07,970
Hope this goes smoothly.
All those monsters on one plane.

313
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,310
Please, Ginny,
this is a well-oiled machine.

314
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,770
The only thing we gotta worry about is
stale peanuts and a little turbulence.

315
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,940
Close forward gate.

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,290
Close middle gate.

317
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,840
Come on,
I need my shot!

318
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,130
Coming. I'm coming.
Left arm.

319
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,230
Hey, Chief, if you come
through this all right...

320
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,980
hope you don't hold
a grudge.

321
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,400
What the fuck
are you doin'?

322
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,750
Get the extinguisher.
Open the middle gate.

323
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,000
The Last Mohican
is burnin', man!

324
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,590
Shit. Did you see that motherfucker,
man? He spontaneously combusted.

325
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,260
He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man.
I seen that shit on Discovery Channel.

326
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,090
- Code red! Code red!
- Chantin' and shit.
- Fire in the rear cabin.

327
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,890
- I've got a fire.
- Where is it?
- She's reporting it in the rear cabin.

328
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,520
At first I thought he was singin'
Y.M.C.A. Then the flames.

329
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,690
Sh-Shit!

330
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,080
Holy shit!
Hold on, Bobby!

331
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,500
Gimme a Taser!

332
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,710
Hey, man,
get off my insulin!

333
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,220
Bobby, open the door!
Open the goddamn door!

334
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,060
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

335
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,810
Pinball, go!
Pull the lever. Go! Go!

336
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,940
Pinball, behind you!

337
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,320
Get the gun out of the lockbox,
Mack. Go on back there, check it out.

338
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,670
Go! Go!

339
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,610
-Oh, my God.
-Say there was a disturbance
but everything's under control.

340
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,360
Say it,
or I will kill you.

341
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,650
Without me, you got nobody
to fly the plane.

342
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,320
I never think
that far ahead.

343
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,580
All right, I'm doin' it.
Just take it easy.

344
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,910
And if you say a word about this over
the radio, the next wings you see...

345
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,250
will belong to the flies buzzing
over your rotting corpse.

346
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,670
Uh, Carson City.

347
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,170
Hey! Hey!

348
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

349
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:24,020
I have the only gun
on board.

350
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,360
Welcome to Con Air.

351
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,120
- What happened?
- Roger that, Carson City.

352
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,120
Calm down, Vince. Just a little ruckus,
and the pilot hit the alarm.

353
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,910
Just a little ruckus?

354
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,580
Pilot just checked in.
Everything's fine.

355
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,130
Transponder's confirmed,
and there's your baby.

356
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,710
Damn, this pig
is heavy!

357
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,720
Oops.

358
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,100
Shit.

359
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
if we let you out,
you gonna play nice, Billy?

360
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,390
Probably not.

361
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,990
I got a spot on my arm
just for you.

362
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,780
Hey, man, yo. Come on,
get off my medication.

363
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,280
I'm sorry, man.
The shit's in my way.

364
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,620
- I'm gonna use your whole body
to make me feel good.
- All right here, man. Come on.

365
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,620
All right, man.
Stop rushin'.

366
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,130
Ah, yeah.

367
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:39,300
No, no. Oh, no!
Make me hurt you.

368
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,100
- What you doin'?
- I can't allow that.

369
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,940
- You know what I am?
- Ugly all day.

370
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,360
This ain't happenin',
not here, not now.

371
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,320
- Oh, it's happenin'.
- Hey!

372
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,820
Relax. He's right.
Not here and not now.

373
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,280
- Do you fly, Johnny?
- No.

374
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,160
You keep that in mind
when you look at her...

375
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,660
because if your dick
jumps out of your pants...

376
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,830
you jump out
of this plane.

377
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:18,680
What are the numbers in Carson City?
How many on, how many off?

378
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,010
- Six off and ten on.
- Find the six.

379
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,980
Well, I know three of these brothers.
Th-They right back there.

380
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,020
Uh, the other three are
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

381
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:34,400
- Where are they?
- That's a damn good question,
Cyrus. And I'm gonna find out.

382
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,740
The pilot wants to know
what's next.

383
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,570
He's to land at Carson City
Airport as scheduled.

384
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,370
Carson City? The law is down
there. You lost your mind?

385
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:47,580
According to my last
psych evaluation, yes.

386
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,580
Diamond Dog,
if you would.

387
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,760
You think you're free?
You're not. Now, listen up.

388
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,050
Forty to 50 U.S. prison guards
armed with shotguns are waitin'
for us at the next stop.

389
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:05,260
Now, if you do exactly
what we tell ya...

390
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:09,230
the rest of our lives will be a vacation
in a non-extradition country.

391
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm talkin' sandy beaches,
umbrella drinks...

392
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,900
and dirty, naked freaks.

393
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,780
it'll be a paid
motherfuckin' vacation.

394
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,120
Wait. Who's doin'
the payin'?

395
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,870
Our employer,
Francisco Cindino.

396
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,210
Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No,
no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no.

397
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,880
Get that ass out here
right now!

398
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,000
- With you in a second.
- Right now!

399
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,550
- Keep cool, boss.
- Shut up.

400
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:42,340
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm DEA. That's who the fuck I am.

401
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,510
- Now you were saying?
- Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus.

402
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,600
So you think I give a shit
about that little bitch guard
you have there right now?

403
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,230
Well, maybe you didn't hear what
I said. I'm DEA. You know what
the fuck that means?

404
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,730
- Y-You the most crooked nigger
on this plane.
- Shut up.

405
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,440
You're DEA? What are you doin'
on this flight? Won't
they fly you boys commercially?

406
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,030
Don't push me, Cyrus, man.
I swear to God, I'll blow away
your little boyfriend right now.

407
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,080
You know, the next time
you choose a human shield...

408
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,000
you're better off not pickin'
a two-bit Negro crackhead.

409
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,750
- Hey!
- Shut up.

410
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,710
- Shoot him.
- Quiet, sweetheart.

411
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,130
- I think you should just stop.
- Stay back, man.

412
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,760
- Stay back!
- Just stop, right?
Before somebody gets killed.

413
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,760
- Back!
- All right, cowboy, I'm back.

414
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,720
- Stay back.
- You know you're in a situation
you can't control, right?

415
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,430
I can't control it?
I can't control it?

416
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,100
- You're a dead man.
- Shut the fuck up!

417
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,170
What's your name,
convict?

418
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,130
- My name?
- Yeah.

419
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,680
- Poe.
- Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work.

420
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,600
Nice goin', son.

421
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,310
Not only did you not save
this dude's life...

422
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,150
you done made best friends
with Cyrus the damn Virus.

423
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,190
Hey, Cyrus, I, uh, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

424
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,700
-Yeah, what's the good news?
-Well, the goods news is I found
Benson, Carls and Popovitch.

425
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,950
- What's the bad news?
- The bad news is...

426
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,160
this dead fellow right here
happens to be Benson.

427
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,500
This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole
in his forehead is, is Carls...

428
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,210
and, and this honky
he's draggin' in is Popovitch.

429
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,880
I don't know how to tell
you this, Cyrus, but we are
three white guys short.

430
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,260
Or as they say in ebonics,
"We be fucked.'

431
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:53,270
Look man,
I just wanna know.

432
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,560
All right, you didn't-- You
didn't mean that dirty-nigger
crackhead shit, did you?

433
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,350
Gimme that gun.

434
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,520
Hell, yes, I meant it.

435
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,360
Listen, Carson City is expecting
six men to get off this plane...

436
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
and we're gonna give 'em
exactly what they expect.

437
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:10,700
- So I need three volunteers.
- Come on, let's go, son.

438
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,910
- Don't look at me, pal.
- What about her?

439
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,330
I'm servin' eight consecutive
life sentences. I am not
getting off this plane.

440
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,040
I got my insulin, all right, but
they broke all the damn needles.

441
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,340
if I don't get my shot
in the next couple of hours...

442
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,380
- somebody gonna be sending
flowers to my mother.
- Hey, I'll go.

443
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,010
- I'm too old for his shit.
- I mean, no offense.

444
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,050
- I can take care of myself.
- I can see that.

445
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,720
Go ahead, go to the back.
Anybody else?

446
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,350
- Hey, right here, man. Us two.
- Great, go ahead. Go to the back.

447
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,900
Hey, whoa, stop. The guys
they're expecting are white.

448
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,030
That puts you
shit out of luck.

449
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,490
- Hey, come on, man.
- I'll tell you what. Sit down.

450
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:54,620
One of my associates will bring
you a phone book, and you call
the Affirmative Action office.

451
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,160
- You, go ahead.
- Yeah, that's it.

452
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,290
- I'm gone, man. I'm dead in two hours.
- No.

453
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,840
I'll get off,
scream to high heaven.

454
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,460
This plane won't leave
Carson City.

455
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,350
We need another white boy
to volunteer.

456
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,560
- Pilot's white.
- Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?

457
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,230
- Who's gonna fly the plane?
- Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine.

458
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,820
- You rang?
- Carson City says we got a hell
of a sandstorm down there.

459
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,660
Perfect.

460
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,700
Crazy.

461
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,880
Vacant cell D8,
ready for inspection.

462
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,840
Last tenant,
Cyrus Grissom.

463
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,010
Got scratches on the wall.
Probably a weapon sharpening.

464
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:55,220
- What about the loose shelf screw?
- What the hell is this?

465
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,260
Looks like cocaine.

466
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:05,610
- What, do you got something there?
- I don't know. it's all soft.

467
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,400
What about the rest
of the pigs?

468
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,950
Be patient, now. They haven't
ceased to be useful yet.

469
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,580
Okay, old man.
Now you're Mr Popovitch.

470
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,330
Gentlemen, you'll reach the
Nevada pen in about two hours.

471
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,670
The tape's just a little
precaution in case any of you...

472
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,170
are rocked by the sudden impulse
to squeal like a pig.

473
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,130
Not that we don't trust you.
But let's face it, you're criminals.

474
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:39,260
- Come on, man, move your head up.
- I want to stay on.

475
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,970
What?

476
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,850
I changed my mind.

477
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,150
So, Cyrus, we got
a little mind-changer.

478
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,530
I got 15 years left, and
I know I'd just hate myself...

479
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,610
if I thought I blew my one shot
at a naked party freak...

480
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,110
and, and
an umbrella drink.

481
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,490
You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago
you couldn't wait to get off this plane.

482
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,290
I know.
Fear of freedom, I guess.

483
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,130
Get him up.
Get the cuffs off him.

484
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,470
Pick out a guard, and then put that
dead cop's prison issues on him.

485
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,140
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Stayin'.

486
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,060
They're gaggin' everybody
for the bus ride to the pen.

487
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,640
it'll be hours before the Feds discover
what happened. By then you'll be dead.

488
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:30,150
- So will she.
- Poe, think of your little girl.

489
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,700
Now, what would my daughter
think of me if I left you like
this to get dishonored and die?

490
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,660
You keep acting like you're still
a Ranger, we're all gonna be in trouble.

491
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,870
You're not that guy anymore.
You're a convict.

492
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,370
Dear God!

493
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,590
- Told you I'd get that back.
- Fuck you, trailer trash.

494
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,180
Hey, my mama lives in a trailer. Now
put those on. I just saved your life.

495
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,220
Okay, soldier boy.
You got a plan?

496
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,060
Maybe.

497
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,240
Chief? I got a lot
of weird shit down here.

498
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,710
- What is it?
- This looks like the drawing
of a plane.

499
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:30,880
- Whose cell is that?
- The Virus.

500
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,950
Open up!

501
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,760
My daughter's picture. Where'd
you put my daughter's picture...

502
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,760
you shit-eatin'
peckerhead?

503
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,770
Heard you had a problem
up there.

504
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:37,480
Had to bag 'em and gag 'em.
Rough crew. Spitters and shitters.

505
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:46,290
On the bus, dickhead!
On the bus!

506
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,800
Let's go.
We're at the gate.

507
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,640
They took the plane. You hear that,
boys? We got the plane, man.

508
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,020
Shut the fuck up, curly, all
right? You gonna get us caught!

509
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,610
No way, Jose!

510
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,320
You gotta be kiddin' me.

511
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,650
Oh, boy.

512
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,830
ln Spanish from Bogota, Colombia.
Looks like it's from a law firm.

513
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,850
Orange and black.

514
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,970
What's up, man?

515
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,350
- So, you the Swamp Thing?
- That's right.

516
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,650
- Flyin' the plane?
- That's right.

517
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:00,860
- it's amazing the shit
you white trash know.
- That's right.

518
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,700
Shit! Aw, man!

519
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,060
What're you doin' here?

520
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,360
Hello.
How you doin', baby?

521
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,570
I'm just, uh, tryin' to get out of
the storm, you know. Grab my lunch.

522
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:48,780
- Well, this is a restricted area.
- Look, don't worry, baby.

523
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,580
- it's all right. I'm a-- I'm a cop.
- You work for a prison or somethin'?

524
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,920
Yeah, the Department of Erect--
Corrections. Caught me slippin'.

525
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Creepy.

526
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,800
The eyes are cut
out of their heads.

527
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,300
The Last Supper.

528
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,600
- is that it?
- One more.

529
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,440
Late addition.

530
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,650
- Who?
- Garland Greene.

531
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,440
Should be interesting.

532
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,670
- What the fuck is that?
- That's Garland Greene, man.

533
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,520
Christ in a cartoon!

534
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,600
Shit, that's
Garland Greene, man.

535
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,520
The Marietta Mangler.

536
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,820
That skinny little man
butchered 30 somethin' people...

537
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,190
up and down
the eastern seaboard.

538
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,190
They say the way
he killed those people...

539
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,360
makes the Manson family
look like the Partridge family.

540
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,290
Well, he's on
the right flight.

541
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,500
- But you know what,
you really do need to leave.
- Tina, you've got...

542
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,830
the prettiest eyes I've seen
in about five to ten.

543
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,800
"Met ca-- Me--
Me. Et cetera.

544
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,810
Cetera. Meet.""

545
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,850
Me, et cetera, me arson.
Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars.

546
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,980
Meet cars. Meet cars.
Meet cars. Where?

547
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,320
"Carson...

548
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,990
City.""

549
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,910
Oh, God. Uh, stay here.
Don't touch anything.

550
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:06,340
Hey, what're you doin'?
Just leave it alone. He told
you not to touch anything.

551
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,570
What the hell?

552
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:38,700
You wanna have some more fun,
keep it up.

553
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,970
Come on.

554
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,660
We've got a situation here, sir.
Somebody better call
the marshal's office.

555
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,580
Code red! Code red!
Starkey, those guards ain't guards.

556
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,500
- They're cons. Stall 'em.
- Christ!

557
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,970
- Hey, how are ya?
- Almost ready?

558
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,600
Won't be long now.

559
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:56,200
- You're the man, Cyrus!
- Let's go!

560
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,370
Do you hear somethin'
that sounds like a damn plane?

561
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,340
Jailbird One, you are
not cleared for takeoff.

562
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,840
Hey, nobody on this aircraft
gives a flyin' fuck!

563
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:21,470
Get it? "Flyin' fuck!'
Thank you. I'm here all week.

564
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,310
Hey! Hey, Cochise,
it's me!

565
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,020
Pinball. I'm sorry.
Hey!

566
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,040
Shine, sweet freedom,
shine!

567
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,920
Trust me, folks. This is gonna be
a day you will never forget.

568
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,880
Just step right on board
and find yourself a seat.

569
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,720
Don't they have a way
of tracking these planes?

570
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:08,560
Oh, yeah. it's called a transponder.
Every plane's got one, Cindino.

571
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,020
Swamp, where is
the transponder?

572
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:17,860
Where indeed?

573
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,780
Are, are you sure it's safe
to fly in this?

574
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:27,870
No problem. I've done this
a thousand times. We'll be
through this in a few minutes.

575
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,040
You all right back there,
ladies?

576
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:35,300
We're following the transponder.
We know exactly where they're heading.

577
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,760
What the fuck happened?

578
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,050
What about Sims?
What happened to Sims?

579
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:43,600
Duncan,
they killed him.

580
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
They got the plane.

581
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,240
Tell me, Skip, what kind
of a Keystone Cops operation
are you guys runnin' here, huh?

582
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,070
And you! You, you little shit.
You got my agent killed!

583
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,120
Hey, he brought a gun
on the plane.

584
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,120
if I knew the way you guys
run things, I would've told him
bring a fuckin' uzi on board!

585
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,750
No one carries on these flights!
No one!

586
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,590
He brought a gun on board
and he got himself killed.

587
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:16,460
And in doing so, he compromised
the safety of my men!

588
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,960
Your men are incompetent!

589
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,300
They let themselves get taken over by
a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!

590
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,300
- I'm not gonna stand around...
- Guys!
- and listen to this shit!

591
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,640
Guys, guys.
Let's work it out.

592
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:31,100
Okay. Okay.

593
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:36,520
So, uh,
what do we do now?

594
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,690
What's the plan? You, uh,
you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?

595
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,690
We're workin' on it.

596
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:43,450
Contingency plans for something
like this don't exist.

597
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,490
-The situation's
never been contemplated.
-Well, you better start contemplating...

598
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:51,830
'cause this is a situation that
needs to get unfucked right now!

599
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,540
I want a chopper. Make that a few
of 'em. They need to be armed.

600
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,960
I don't care if it's National
Guard, Air Force, whatever.

601
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,010
Just get 'em here,
and get 'em here now.

602
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,180
- What do you want to do with him?
- I don't know.

603
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,180
But this is no way to treat
a national treasure. Let him out.

604
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,850
- You sure?
- Love your work.

605
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,510
They're headed southeast
toward Arizona.

606
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,570
- Pinball didn't make it.
- No?

607
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,360
That's too bad.
I liked Pinball.

608
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,700
- What do you want?
- I wanna know what the plan is.

609
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:11,240
Why you care?

610
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,120
I got just as much ridin' on this
as you. We're all convicts here.

611
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,210
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

612
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,380
Cyrus Grissom,
do you copy?

613
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,550
Yes, I copy.
ldentify yourself.

614
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,430
This is United States Marshal Vince
Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA.

615
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,050
Oh, Agent Malloy. I'm so sorry
about your associate.

616
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,640
Nothing is quite as sad as seeing
a grown man pissing his pants.

617
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,930
Listen, Grissom,
you puny, fucking animal!

618
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,730
When I get through with you, you'll be
beggin' 'em for the electric chair.

619
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,900
Hey, I don't like him.

620
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,940
if he speaks again, this
conversation is terminated.

621
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:48,610
He doesn't want to talk again.
Really. He's done talking.
He's leaving the building, okay?

622
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,200
Good, then I'll talk to you.
Here are the rules.

623
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,080
First I ask a question,
then you ask a question.

624
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,790
Okay.
What's your question?

625
00:47:55,910 --> 00:47:59,080
ln Carson City, your bulls
were onto us. How?

626
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,420
- One of the guards--
- One of the guards--

627
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,420
One of the guards faked a heart attack
and we had to remove his restraints.

628
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,590
All right?

629
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:10,590
I see.
And what's your question?

630
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,930
Where you goin'
with my plane, Cyrus?

631
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:15,970
- We're going to Disneyland.
- You're lying, Cyrus.

632
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:20,270
So are you, Vince.
Oh, nothin'

633
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:24,780
Makes me sadder than the agent
lost his bladder in the

634
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,150
Airplane

635
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,280
Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere.
That's our rendezvous point.

636
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,750
Forty-nine minutes from anything
resembling authority.

637
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,290
So, now you know.

638
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,080
Your attention, please.
Flight 475--

639
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:45,800
You excited? Yeah?
Sure look pretty.

640
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,470
- Mrs. Poe?
- That's right.

641
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,140
My name's Grant,
U.S. Marshal Service.

642
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:01,150
There's been a slight problem
on your husband's flight.
Your presence is requested.

643
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:03,860
I have a jet
standing by.

644
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,870
Yee-ha!
What's on your mind, hillbilly?

645
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,370
What was I thinking about?

646
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,000
Oh, yeah. Yee-ha.
That's right.

647
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,000
I was just wonderin' what a black
militant, uh, that would be you...

648
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,550
was doin' takin' orders from
a white boy on a power trip.

649
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:31,630
-Don't you think that's strange?
-it's a means to an end,
my white friend.

650
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,180
A means to an end.
See...

651
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,680
I's can play house nigger till's
we get to where we're goin'.

652
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,190
And then,
the day of the dog begins.

653
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,530
So what was that
all about?

654
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:56,370
Oh, nothin',
except they somehow managed...

655
00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:00,700
to get every creep and freak
in the universe onto this one plane...

656
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,830
and then somehow managed
to let them take it over...

657
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:09,050
and then somehow managed to stick us
right smack in the middle.

658
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,720
Hi, Garland.

659
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:24,600
Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe.
His wife's on the way here now.

660
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,610
U.S. Ranger,
highly decorated.

661
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,520
Did a little hell-raising when
he was a kid, but nothing serious.

662
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,900
Explain to me
why any of this matters.

663
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,450
Fact one. We got a plane up there filled
with killers, rapists and thieves...

664
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,570
and we got this guy Cameron Poe,
in on an involuntary manslaughter beef.

665
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,620
Non-gang affiliated. He's
a parolee hitchin' a ride home.

666
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:43,250
Fact two. Poe has a chance
to get off the plane.

667
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:45,870
Doesn't do it. Why?

668
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,590
Fact three. Our guard, Falzon,
said a convict named Cameron Poe...

669
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:51,960
planted Sims's
tape recorder on him.

670
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,680
These are interesting facts.
You do the math on this, and
we got an ally on that plane.

671
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,350
Ally? This guy is a criminal.
A murderer.

672
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:05,140
Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl
defending his wife and he killed a guy.

673
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,440
Could have happened to any one
of us, including you and me.

674
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,190
I am not one
of these animals.

675
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,940
Oh, that's original! When exactly
did they all become animals?

676
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:14,240
When they stopped giving a damn
about the law, about civilization.

677
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,240
"The degree of civilization
in a society can be judged
by observing its prisoners.'

678
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,240
Dostoevsky said that
after doing a little time.

679
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:26,080
"Fuck you!' Cyrus Grissom
said that after putting a bullet
in my agent's head. Okay?

680
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,580
The issue here is how the plane
is brought down.

681
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,630
Shoot it down.

682
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:34,720
Yeah. When exactly did this
become a DEA jurisdiction?

683
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,430
The second the DEA agent
was murdered.

684
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,260
I am authorized to bring Agent Sims's
killers to justice using...

685
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,310
and I quote,
"All necessary means.'

686
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,310
- That does not include
shooting down my plane.
- Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.

687
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:49,150
is that right? Tell me you're
not seriously entertaining this.

688
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,940
Vince, this is
a drastic situation we got.

689
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,490
-Those are our men up there!
-All of whom signed a no-hostage
clause. They know the score.

690
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:59,030
Who are you to decide the value
of a man's life? There are
innocent people up there!

691
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:02,620
About time.

692
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,290
-For what? About time for what?
-Attack choppers. We're going after 'em.

693
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,130
Goddamn it!
Skip, don't do this!

694
00:52:15,210 --> 00:52:18,180
This man is in an irrational state
of mind! His head isn't on straight.

695
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,140
Fuck off, Marshal Larkin.
Your job's finished. This flight's full.

696
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,150
Gentlemen, in roughly
five hours, we will be flying
over the shores of Mexico.

697
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,150
But first we have
to change aircraft.

698
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,660
Thank you, and have
a pleasant flight.

699
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:46,830
- What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?
- At 228 miles an hour,
about 71 minutes.

700
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:50,540
The only problem is, we're not doing
228 miles an hour. We're doing 205.

701
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:54,340
We're draggin', baby.
The landing gear ain't all
the way up. We're gonna be late.

702
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,840
- No, no, no. Cyrus,
that's unacceptable.
- Check out the gear.

703
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,680
- What the hell do I know
about landing gear?
- Learn.

704
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,890
Hillbilly!

705
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,850
Poe.

706
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,360
- Yeah?
- Cyrus wants you to check out
the landing gear.

707
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,530
Then I'll get to see some nice
scenery whippin' by down there.

708
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:26,870
Trees and stuff.

709
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,230
Goddamn! So that's
what happened to Pinball.

710
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,560
Cut him loose. He's slowin'
us down. Dead weight.

711
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,230
Not exactly
a proper burial.

712
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:58,780
Look at our shit
over there.

713
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,300
Hurry up.

714
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,930
Hillbilly.

715
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:26,640
Gotcha.

716
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:30,430
Hurry up, man.

717
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:38,150
Bye, Pinball.

718
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,290
Oh, boy! You see that?
You see?

719
00:54:55,420 --> 00:55:00,460
Every time we get her waxed,
I get ten feet from the car wash
and then, pow, bird shit.

720
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,970
Well, it's supposed to be
good luck.

721
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:08,600
- Light's changed.
- Oh, damn.

722
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,000
- You were in the "Q,' right?
- Yeah.

723
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,540
And I heard you say
you had 15 years.

724
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,500
That's right.

725
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,670
But then that would put you
on north block. Right?

726
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,720
Yeah.

727
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,390
Yeah. Funny thing.

728
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:55,350
I was on north block.
I don't know you.

729
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,850
Well, you know what,
uh, pal?

730
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,530
What do you think that means?
Nothin'. Not diddly shit.

731
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,030
You see, there were 160 cats
on north block...

732
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:10,530
and I didn't want to know 159
of them, which included you.

733
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,080
What do you think
about that?

734
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,080
Yeah.

735
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,760
He's a font
of misplaced rage.

736
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,260
Name your cliche. Mother held
him too much, or not enough.

737
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:33,100
Last picked at kick ball,
late-night sneaky uncle. Whatever.

738
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:38,770
Now he's so angry, moments of
levity actually cause him pain.

739
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,560
Gives him headaches.

740
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,270
Happiness, for
that gentleman, hurts.

741
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,440
What's wrong with him?

742
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,740
My first thought would be
a lot.

743
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:55,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

744
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,500
- Hi. I'm, I'm Vince Larkin.
- I'm Tricia Poe.

745
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,170
Nice to meet ya.
This, this must be Casey.

746
00:57:01,290 --> 00:57:04,090
- Hello, Casey.
- Hello, Vince Larkin.
- Nice to meet ya.

747
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:07,130
So how are you doin'?

748
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:09,590
I'm sorry. That's, uh-- Scratch
that. Dumb question. You--

749
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:13,140
You wanted to see your husband today,
and then this whole thing happened.

750
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,600
Maybe you could just tell me
exactly what's going on here and--

751
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,640
We're doing everything we can
to get the plane down.

752
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,770
Actually, that's w-why I wanted
to talk to you.

753
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:29,490
Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get
the rims, man?

754
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:32,610
My personal shit's
down in the belly.

755
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,040
- Hey, those are my shades.
- They're mine now, sister.

756
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,120
Men!

757
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:49,130
it seems that your husband,
Cameron...

758
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,630
had an opportunity to get off
the plane and he didn't do it.

759
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,300
And I was hoping
you could...

760
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:57,970
maybe help me
figure out why.

761
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,480
That would make two of us.
I don't know.

762
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,560
I mean, it's possible,
it's, it's not uncommon...

763
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:07,570
that some parolees actually fear
their release date.

764
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:11,320
A certain degree of institutionalization
sets in. Fear of coming home.

765
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,910
- Fear of living in society.
Any of this make sense?
- No, no.

766
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,830
That's not Cameron. I mean, if you, if
you knew him, if you read his letters...

767
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,660
or if you talked to him
on the phone, you'd know that--

768
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:25,000
I mean, he's been waitin' for this day
for eight years. He's not gonna--

769
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:32,010
I mean, look, he's got this little,
this little girl to come home to.

770
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,180
Wouldn't you...

771
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,350
do the same thing?

772
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,350
There'd have to be a pretty strong
reason to keep me on that plane.

773
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:47,520
Well, knowing Cameron,
I'm sure there is a good reason.

774
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:54,450
Uh, maybe, if you, if you do
see him or if you talk to him...

775
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:58,740
maybe you could just tell him
to come home, all right?

776
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,290
Be kinda nice
to have him around.

777
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:04,250
You got it.

778
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:07,460
Vince, line one.

779
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,880
This body fell out
of the sky.

780
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,220
Vince Larkin? This is Ted Grasso,
Fresno Police Department.

781
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,640
We got a problem here
with a corpse.

782
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,770
Yeah, it fell out
of the sky.

783
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,810
I don't think
he's an astronaut.

784
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,940
Then what's this got
to do with me?

785
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,730
it's got your name
written all over it.

786
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,910
Last transponder tag
was in Arizona.

787
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:40,330
Body falls here,
in Fresno.

788
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:43,250
Lerner Airfield.
They're turning around.

789
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:44,910
- They're coming back.
Can you get me Chief--
- Devers.

790
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,960
Please. Thank you.

791
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,330
- Vince?
- Turn around.

792
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,250
Plane's headed to Lerner Airfield. it's
a small strip about 100 miles from here.

793
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:56,130
Horseshit! We're tailing the
transponder tag into Arizona.

794
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,590
Listen to me.
A body fell from the sky.

795
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,100
it had a note on it.

796
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,140
We got 'em vectored
at 12:00 and 30 miles.

797
01:00:04,270 --> 01:00:08,270
- Vince, please, son.
We're right on his tail.
- Just listen to me!

798
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:10,770
it was to me!
The note on the body was to me!

799
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,030
- You're chasing the wrong--
- Aw, shut up.

800
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,440
Hello?

801
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,780
Guys, guys! I need a plane
or a chopper now!

802
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,330
Hey, you and me both.
I'm all out.

803
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:24,120
I've got to get to Lerner Airfield
and I've got about 50 minutes.

804
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,330
Got a fast car,
you can drive it.

805
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,710
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
I'm with the Marshal Services.

806
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,460
Send whatever you got. Sheriff,
state trooper, national guard.

807
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,970
Hold on one minute.

808
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,220
Your men should proceed
with extreme caution.

809
01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:45,810
it's only a matter of time
before they find the weapons hold.

810
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,900
Larkin. Vince Larkin.
Marshal Services.

811
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,900
How do you think
I got the number?

812
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,200
'...appears to the United States
Parole Commission that--'

813
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,910
Poe.

814
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,380
Man! Oh, yeah!

815
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,550
Put the bunny
back in the box.

816
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:21,180
I knew you was a punk.
And I was right.

817
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,430
You been playin' us
all along.

818
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:27,060
You a free man.

819
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,020
I said, put the bunny...

820
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,610
back in the box.

821
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,970
Die, punk!

822
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:19,070
Why couldn't you put the bunny
back in the box?

823
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:25,160
Next, folks, below and to your left,
you'll see the vertical Renoir Cliffs.

824
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:31,120
We're seconds away from
establishing visual contact.

825
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,830
Holy shit!

826
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,090
Abort! Abort! Abort!

827
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:44,010
if that aircraft's carrying
30 prisoners, I'm Elvis Presley.

828
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:47,930
"Uncle Bob's Scenic Tours.'

829
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,890
Shit!

830
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:56,900
Three hundred fuckin' miles
to apprehend Ma and Pa fucking Kettle!

831
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,820
We need to get
to Lerner Airfield now!

832
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,110
Get me Vince Larkin.

833
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:14,830
Two went down,
one came up.

834
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,170
- Wasn't my fault.
- Well, you don't have to tell me.

835
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:21,000
Most murders are crimes
of necessity rather than desire.

836
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:25,340
But the great ones,
Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy...

837
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:27,760
- they did it because it excited them.
- Don't you--

838
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,850
I got nothing in common
with them, with you.

839
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:35,390
Don't you talk to me!
They were insane.

840
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,020
Now you're talking
semantics.

841
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:43,030
What if I told you insane
was working 50 hours a week
in some office for 50 years...

842
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,860
at the end of which
they tell you to piss off?

843
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:48,370
Ending up
in some retirement village...

844
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,870
hoping to die before suffering
the indignity of trying to make
it to the toilet on time.

845
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,790
Wouldn't you consider that
to be insane?

846
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:02,550
Murdering 30 people,
semantics or not, is insane!

847
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,050
One girl...

848
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:08,220
I drove through three states
wearing her head as a hat.

849
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,260
it's my daughter's birthday
today.

850
01:04:11,350 --> 01:04:14,430
So please feel free
not to share everything with me.

851
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:19,500
All right, you damn peckerwoods,
crack the knuckles and hit the crystals.

852
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,920
We're putting this baby
down in a sandbox.

853
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:33,850
Lerner Tower,
do you copy?

854
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,020
Lerner Tower,
are you there, Phil?

855
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:43,480
Come on, answer me.

856
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:46,150
I am landing.

857
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:16,470
Oh, my God.

858
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,720
Look out!

859
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:35,970
Lerner Airfield.
I'm so glad to be here.

860
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:41,930
Thank you
for choosing Con Air.

861
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:47,980
- Where's the plane, Francisco?
- I don't know. Have patience.

862
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,900
The last guy who told me to have
patience? I burned him down,
and bagged his ashes.

863
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,990
Cyrus, it'll be here.

864
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:05,080
Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!
Jesus Christ!

865
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,630
I hope he likes sand.

866
01:08:13,710 --> 01:08:17,010
-Muchacho, run and check out the
tower. Have a look-see, yeah?
-All right.

867
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:18,930
You come with us.

868
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:25,980
- Let's go. We're gettin' off.
- Boss, I can't.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

869
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,690
- You shouldn't move him.
- I'm getting him off of this plane.

870
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,770
You, you can't move him. He's
too far along. He could go into shock.

871
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:35,150
She's right, Poe.
Go on, man.

872
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,610
I'm not leaving
without you, or you.

873
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,660
Ah, listen. Here we go.
Ranger boy.

874
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:44,040
- Right.
- Goddamn it, Poe!

875
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,710
Man, it's time to fight,
fuck or hit the fence.

876
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,250
- I suggest you hit the fence.
- He's right.

877
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:51,710
Just go.

878
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:55,170
All right. Here's how it's gonna play.
I'm gonna get you that needle.

879
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:57,970
Whatever you say, man.
Just do what you gotta do.

880
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,640
Fuck.

881
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,510
All right, you just hang on.
Don't die on me.

882
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:08,060
Swing low, sweet chariot

883
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:11,150
Comin' for
to carry me home

884
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,980
Oh, no. What the hell
you think you're doin'?

885
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,820
- it's time to off the pigs.
- You can't do that.

886
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:20,860
- Tell me why.
- They're hostages. We need 'em.

887
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,740
- But why the fuck you care?
- Hey, man, come on.

888
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,830
I can't think of a thing
I'd like better...

889
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,340
than to put a bullet in the brain base
of every one of these fuckers!

890
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,380
But the fact of the matter is,
how well you know this Cindino?

891
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:41,590
I mean, I don't know him that
well myself. Just what I read.

892
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:45,140
Like how he firebombed
that senator's yacht with two
of his own cousins on board.

893
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,310
So what's your point?

894
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,940
Why would he sweat
about killing some hired guns
once they'd served his purpose?

895
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,860
- Now think about that.
- What exactly are we discussing here?

896
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,360
Poe don't want me
to off the pigs.

897
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:00,200
Well, it's not difficult to surmise how
Nathan here feels about killing guards.

898
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,870
And my own proclivities
are, uh...

899
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:08,370
well-known and, uh,
often-lamented facts of penal lore.

900
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:11,290
What I'm wonderin' is why you have
any opinion about it at all.

901
01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:14,210
Cyrus, this is your barbecue,
man, and it tastes good.

902
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:18,630
But I was just sayin' to Mr. Dog over
here, that if it was my barbecue...

903
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:22,550
I'd wait for that old jumbo jet
in the sky before I start
killin' our only leverage.

904
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:25,390
- Shut the fuck up!
- Don't you want to get high
and get laid?

905
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:26,890
- Shit.
- Oh, fuck this!

906
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:31,520
Put the gun down.
Put the gun down, Nathan.

907
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,190
Poe's right.
We're goin' to Plan "B.'

908
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:37,110
Gonna get a refuelling truck
and a tractor.

909
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,610
So get back there
and dig the plane out.

910
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,420
No. Yes!

911
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:21,820
- Viking, 'bout time to go
and get that tractor, yeah?
- Right.

912
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:26,280
- I'll get the fuel truck.
- Thanks, Poe.

913
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:29,120
You've proven to be
a most useful mammal.

914
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:32,830
"Many hands make light work.'
My daddy taught me that.

915
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,460
- You know what my daddy taught me?
- What's that?

916
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:39,590
- Nothin'.
- Self-educated man.

917
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,510
-Have you found Vince Larkin?
-We're having trouble reaching him, sir.

918
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,350
Of course, you're having trouble
reaching him!

919
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:53,060
He's off saving the rain forest
or recycling his sandals or some shit.

920
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:29,510
Holy shit!

921
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:39,350
Hey! We've got company!

922
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,480
Hey!

923
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:44,110
We've got company!

924
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,280
Go get Cyrus.

925
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,030
Yo, Cyrus!

926
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,080
How long we got
till they get here, Nathan?

927
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:03,050
Ten, twelve minutes, tops.

928
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:14,850
Hey, what's your name?
Wanna play?

929
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,400
Nice jet.

930
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:31,740
You can take Cindino and leave
the rest to rot for all I care.

931
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:35,790
You fire that weapon, 20 pissed-off
prisoners are gonna hear it.

932
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,670
Well, hooray for the sounds
of fuckin' silence.

933
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,590
Freeze!

934
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,070
- You're Cameron Poe.
- That's right.

935
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:10,950
- I'm Larkin.
- Hello, Larkin.

936
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:13,280
- I got your message.
- Where are the troops?

937
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,120
- They'll be here.
- "They'll be here"?

938
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,950
Uh-huh. ln a minute.

939
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,790
Listen, Poe,
can I lower this?

940
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,920
- Go ahead.
- You gonna lower yours?

941
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,130
Sorry, boss, but there's only
two men I trust.

942
01:14:29,210 --> 01:14:31,630
One of them's me.
The other's not you.

943
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:37,470
- So Cindino was running
a drag on everyone.
- Yeah.

944
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,230
if you can't trust a South American
drug lord, who can you trust, huh?

945
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,900
- That was a joke.
- I'm glad you told me. Now
I gotta get back to the plane.

946
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:51,530
You're a free man, Poe.
What are you doin'?

947
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:54,990
I can't trade a friend's life
for my own, Larkin. That's all.

948
01:14:55,070 --> 01:14:57,830
You got a friend on board?

949
01:14:57,870 --> 01:15:01,830
See, I knew I was right
about you. I read your file.

950
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:05,420
You're not such a bad guy. Just always
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

951
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,670
Good-bye, Larkin.

952
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,050
I spoke to your wife.

953
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:20,810
- ln person?
- ln person.

954
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,770
And your little girl.

955
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:28,860
You saw Casey?

956
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,370
if this thing goes bad, Larkin,
I'm afraid my daughter...

957
01:15:36,410 --> 01:15:39,700
won't understand.

958
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:44,040
if you talk to my wife again,
you tell her...

959
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,040
I love her.

960
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:50,050
She's my hummingbird.

961
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:54,800
But I couldn't leave
a fallen man behind.

962
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,390
You'll do that for me,
won't you, Larkin?

963
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:04,640
Sure I will.
What are you gonna do for me?

964
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:07,150
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

965
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,230
I'm gonna save
the fuckin' day.

966
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:27,290
Let's go, gentlemen.
The cavalry is on its way.

967
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:32,340
- I want this airplane out now.
- Come on, men!

968
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:50,940
- About another ten minutes.
- You said ten minutes ten minutes ago.

969
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,610
Hello, Bob.
Wanna come over for dinner?

970
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:04,500
Are you sick?

971
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,080
- Why do you ask?
- You look sick.

972
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,340
- I am sick.
- You take medicine?

973
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,590
There is no medicine
for what I have.

974
01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:19,930
- Wanna sing?
- Sing?

975
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:22,640
Do you know "He's Got
the Whole World in His Hands"?

976
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,350
Yes, I do.

977
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:29,390
He's got the whole world
in His hands

978
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,520
He's got
the whole wide world

979
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:33,610
Come on.

980
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:38,990
He's got the whole world
in His hands

981
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:43,370
He's got the whole wide world
in His hands

982
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:47,960
He's got the whole world
in His hands

983
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,960
He's got the whole world
in His hands

984
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,690
it's on the ground. Repeat.
The plane is on the ground.

985
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:14,730
But it won't be for long.
Where the hell are ya?

986
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,900
We're westbound
near the Lerner cutoff.

987
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:50,060
Where's Cindino?

988
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,650
That's my fuckin' plane!

989
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,610
Cyrus, help me.

990
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,120
- Looks like you missed your connection.
- We were-- We were coming to get you.

991
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:56,120
Please.

992
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,920
- Cy--
- --Onara.

993
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,420
No!

994
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:42,630
- Don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you, old-timer.

995
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:45,170
Listen, I need a syringe.

996
01:20:45,260 --> 01:20:48,590
Oh, no!
Drugs'll end you, son.

997
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,760
Is there a first aid kit
around here?

998
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:53,520
Well, there might be one in the
fire truck over on the boneyard.

999
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:58,060
All right, thanks. You just
stay here and don't panic.

1000
01:20:58,150 --> 01:21:01,270
That's easy for you to say.
You don't gotta take a piss.

1001
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:18,750
- Let's get it on.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice.
- Lock and load!

1002
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:26,800
Considering my audience, I'm gonna
make this very quick, very simple.

1003
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,680
This is the boneyard.
This is the hangar.

1004
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,680
This is our plane.

1005
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:36,560
- What's that?
- That's a rock.

1006
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,440
Okay.

1007
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,900
The convoy will enter
the boneyard through here.

1008
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:45,400
lnitially, we take out the first car.
Then we take out the last...

1009
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,320
creating a trap,
an airtight cage...

1010
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:51,780
filled with lots and lots
of dead people.

1011
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,240
Nathan, set everybody
in their position, yeah?

1012
01:21:55,950 --> 01:21:58,460
Bring me
those propane tanks.

1013
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:04,340
Whoo, go girl.

1014
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:07,550
Let's go, let's go. Get 'em in there.
if they give you any trouble, kill 'em.

1015
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,590
What can I do?

1016
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,890
Take this. Go into
the boneyard, yeah?

1017
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:19,430
- Anybody gets through,
you scratch their eyes out.
- You got it.

1018
01:23:11,650 --> 01:23:14,660
Come on, little piggy.

1019
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:35,260
Closer. Closer. Closer.

1020
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:45,730
Christ.
They'll be slaughtered.

1021
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:50,360
This is Larkin.
Tell your men to fall back!

1022
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:52,360
Now.

1023
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:26,690
Come on, you stinking
piece-of-shit car!

1024
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:34,280
- What are you gonna do?
- What you doin', man?

1025
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,030
Well, Baby-O...

1026
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:41,700
it's not exactly mai tais
and Yahtzee out here, but...

1027
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:45,870
let's do it!

1028
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,390
Gonna see what happens
now, bitch!

1029
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:01,010
Bishop.

1030
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:16,030
- Get the fuck off me!
- I'm gonna bust your ass!

1031
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,700
Leave her alone, man!

1032
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:36,260
Get behind the truck!

1033
01:25:36,380 --> 01:25:38,180
Get behind the truck!

1034
01:25:57,150 --> 01:26:02,280
- When you wake up, Bishop,
I'll be Johnny 24.
- You wanna fight somebody?

1035
01:26:20,430 --> 01:26:24,850
Don't treat women
like that!

1036
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:29,310
Aw, shit!

1037
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:34,820
Whoa! Whoa!

1038
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:39,570
Get back to the plane!

1039
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,820
Oh, my god!

1040
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,880
Okay!

1041
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:05,850
You might better
get yourself a seat now.

1042
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:14,650
- Come on.
- Oh, shit! We're in.

1043
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:22,030
Just take it and let's go.
Get ready to move.

1044
01:27:28,660 --> 01:27:31,120
We're tied up!

1045
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:50,560
- Now, come on!
- Okay, I'm comin'.

1046
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:57,150
- Go for the tires!
- Fuck the tires!
I'm goin' for the pilot!

1047
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:11,410
lsn't that your car, Malloy?

1048
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:14,750
Couldn't be.
I left mine at the office.

1049
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,170
On any other day,
that might seem strange.

1050
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:36,650
Gotta get her nose up!

1051
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,550
Fuckers!
Come on!

1052
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:12,640
- When this is over,
so are you, you little prick!
- Okay.

1053
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:22,570
Bye-bye, Bob, bye-bye.

1054
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:32,240
Go, girl!

1055
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,660
Sweet home Alabama

1056
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:37,290
All right!

1057
01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:39,880
Where the skies
are so blue

1058
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,420
Define irony.

1059
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,670
Bunch of idiots
dancing on a plane...

1060
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:49,890
to a song made famous by a band
that died in a plane crash.

1061
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:59,600
ln Birmingham
they love the governor

1062
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:04,860
We all did
what we could do

1063
01:30:06,440 --> 01:30:11,910
Now Watergate
does not bother me

1064
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:16,450
Does you conscience bother you
Tell me true

1065
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:20,540
Sweet home Alabama

1066
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:27,130
Someone alerted the authorities
at Carson City.

1067
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:30,180
Someone told them
about our Lerner rendezvous.

1068
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:33,350
Someone even killed
poor Billy Bedlam.

1069
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:38,430
Now, could this all
be coincidence? Perhaps.

1070
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:42,310
Then someone went
and tied a rope to our plane.

1071
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:46,860
So I ask you,
what is going on?

1072
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:51,820
And I answer.
We have a traitor in our midst.

1073
01:30:51,910 --> 01:30:55,950
Now, how do we flush
a traitor?

1074
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:58,870
I don't know,
but at the count of three...

1075
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,420
I will find out who is
on my team and who is not.

1076
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,750
That would be one, two--

1077
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:07,420
Wait! it was me.

1078
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:09,210
it was me.

1079
01:31:09,340 --> 01:31:13,340
Don't listen to him, man.
T-T-The insulin made him crazy.

1080
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:16,560
You have been near death
the entire trip?

1081
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,730
- Yeah, motherfucker, it was me.
- No, he's, he's flipped out,
man. He's nuts.

1082
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:21,690
it's pretty clever,
huh, bitch?

1083
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:25,560
- No! Jesus!
- No, that's clever!

1084
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:32,910
"My daddy is coming home
on July 14th.

1085
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:36,280
My birthday is July 14th.

1086
01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:39,660
I'm gonna see my daddy
for the first time ever...

1087
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:43,370
on July 14th.""

1088
01:31:43,460 --> 01:31:45,790
Make a move,
and the bunny gets it.

1089
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:54,130
- Let's take him out, Larkin.
- Not yet!

1090
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:55,800
Fire!

1091
01:31:55,890 --> 01:31:57,890
Goddamn it, Malloy!

1092
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:02,430
- Cease fire!
- Get up here!

1093
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,270
- What are we waiting for?
- That is my plane!

1094
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:10,610
You got it, Agent Malloy?
You with me?

1095
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:13,530
Or do you need me to draw it
in crayon, like usual?

1096
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,530
I got a bad feeling, son.

1097
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:21,580
- I'm feeling like maybe
I'm not supposed to make it.
- You're gonna make it.

1098
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:26,250
Cyrus Grissom, this is
Special Agent Vince Larkin.

1099
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:30,750
We will shoot the plane down
if you do not respond now.

1100
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:36,720
All I can think about is like,
there ain't no God.

1101
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,600
That He don't exist.

1102
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:46,980
- Hey, where you goin'?
- I'm gonna show you God does exist!

1103
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,110
Fire!

1104
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:57,410
Malloy, you son of a bitch!
Cease fire!

1105
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,990
Yes!

1106
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:04,660
Freeze, little bitch boy!

1107
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,180
- Switch to missile.
- Roger that, Two.

1108
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:20,640
Arming missiles.

1109
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:22,970
Malloy, don't you do it!
Get in his way.

1110
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,520
Shit!

1111
01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:28,690
What the hell
are you doing, Larkin?

1112
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:30,860
- I got no move, sir.
- Stupid bastard!

1113
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:47,710
- No! Poe!
- Land this thing!

1114
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:51,420
- Where the hell is the Virus?
- I'm the new captain.
Put this thing down.

1115
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,170
Target locked, sir.

1116
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:56,170
- Oh, yeah!
- Don't you do it!

1117
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,550
- Don't shoot!
- Don't fire.

1118
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,220
- Who is this?
- ldentify yourself.

1119
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:02,680
- This is Cameron Poe.
- Yes!

1120
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,680
Poe!

1121
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,650
Poe!

1122
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:13,940
- I repeat, target is locked, sir.
- Malloy, he's got the plane!

1123
01:34:14,020 --> 01:34:18,780
We're not over civilian population.
Now is the time, sir.

1124
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:21,910
- Don't fire.
- Malloy, listen to him! He's a friend!

1125
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:24,870
He's just trying to get home
to see his wife and kid! Don't fire!

1126
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:27,250
Now's the time, sir.

1127
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:30,790
- Hold fire.
- Sir?

1128
01:34:30,870 --> 01:34:33,630
- I said hold fire!
- Thank you.

1129
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:39,170
Poe!

1130
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,260
Poe!

1131
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:45,310
- Cyrus!
- What?

1132
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:54,360
All right, Poe,
the Las Vegas Airport.

1133
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:56,940
it's just past the strip.
Can you see it?

1134
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:59,400
Well, viva Las Vegas.

1135
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:03,410
it's right there, man. You can
make it. All the runways are
cleared. Come on, do it, Poe.

1136
01:35:03,490 --> 01:35:05,280
Put this thing down.

1137
01:35:05,410 --> 01:35:09,120
Listen here, big daddy.
We got one engine shot to shit...

1138
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:12,250
zero fuel,
and we're droppin' too fast.

1139
01:35:12,330 --> 01:35:17,000
The strip's where I'm gonna
land. Only the word is crash.

1140
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:20,920
Should've shot 'em down
over the open desert, Larkin.

1141
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:23,140
Now the civilian casualties
will be enormous.

1142
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:34,020
Strap in, ladies. We're goin'
for a night out in Vegas.

1143
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,030
He's got the whole world
in His hands

1144
01:35:40,110 --> 01:35:44,030
He's got the whole world
in His hands

1145
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:48,160
- He's got the whole wide world
in His hands
- Shut the fuck up, you freak!
We're gonna die!

1146
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:54,670
- Can he make it to the airport?
- No way, sir.

1147
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:02,050
All right. We're gonna need
police cars, uh, fire engines,
emergency service vehicles,

1148
01:36:02,130 --> 01:36:05,010
anybody who knows CPR.

1149
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,360
Oh, this is beautiful!

1150
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,740
Wake up, Cyrus!

1151
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:30,790
ln His hands

1152
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,670
Little, bitty babies

1153
01:36:47,390 --> 01:36:48,970
Cyrus, wake up!

1154
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:56,980
Stay with me.

1155
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,700
Will the driver of the
white corvette please move
your car or it will be towed.

1156
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:10,450
We are shit outta road!
I'm outta here!

1157
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:26,430
Before I kill you, Poe,
I just wanted you to know...

1158
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:30,350
that the last thing that little
Casey Poe ever gets to smell...

1159
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:33,520
will be my stinking breath.

1160
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,390
Freeze!

1161
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,770
Okay, lady,
hold it right there!

1162
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:00,560
- How am I doin', son?
- You're doin' fine.

1163
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:16,620
Check you out at the hospital,
son. You're gonna be fine.

1164
01:39:39,980 --> 01:39:43,560
- Yeah, this one's dead.
- We better get him outta here.

1165
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:50,110
So what are you
gonna do now?

1166
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:54,110
I started this day with a birthday party
to get to, and I'm gonna get to it.

1167
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,370
Thank you.

1168
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:07,380
You take care,
Sally Bishop.

1169
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,960
Hey, Poe.

1170
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:13,550
Next time, take the bus.

1171
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:24,480
Come on, sweetie.
Go with Ginny and your mom.

1172
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,650
- Cyrus.
- Grissom.

1173
01:40:58,680 --> 01:41:00,310
Move!

1174
01:41:33,710 --> 01:41:36,010
Come get it!
Come on now!

1175
01:41:36,090 --> 01:41:37,890
- That gun work?
- Yeah.

1176
01:41:37,970 --> 01:41:40,260
Well, shoot
that piece of shit!

1177
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,880
Jesus!

1178
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:10,690
- What the hell is that?
- You pull over.

1179
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:12,480
Yeah, sure.
How 'bout this?

1180
01:43:20,570 --> 01:43:23,910
You ain't gettin' near
my daughter. Buckle up.

1181
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:13,060
Just so's you know,
Marshal Larkin...

1182
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:17,060
there's now three men
I trust.

1183
01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:19,310
Am I one of 'em?

1184
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:31,870
This is a weird thing to be
on a plane full of hard asses.

1185
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:35,040
- You okay?
- No.

1186
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,500
Good. I'm glad we didn't
shoot it down, huh?

1187
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:40,040
Oh, yeah, worked out
much better this way.

1188
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:43,880
Listen, I--

1189
01:45:44,010 --> 01:45:46,840
I wanna apologize
about the car.

1190
01:45:46,930 --> 01:45:49,050
I know a good body shop
in Fresno if it's insured.

1191
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:54,100
- I was bored with that car anyway.
- it worked out nicely then.

1192
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:06,400
How do I

1193
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:11,450
Get through one night
without you

1194
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:16,080
if I had to live
without you

1195
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:19,750
What kind of life
would that be

1196
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,420
Oh, now

1197
01:46:23,550 --> 01:46:27,090
I need you in my arms
Need you to hold me

1198
01:46:27,130 --> 01:46:30,430
- Hello, Cameron.
- You're my world, my heart, my soul

1199
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:35,970
- Hello, hummingbird.
- if you ever leave

1200
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:39,940
- Baby, you would take away everything
- I meant to get a haircut.

1201
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:44,070
Good in my life

1202
01:46:44,150 --> 01:46:46,440
I got a present for ya,
Casey.

1203
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:52,320
Without you

1204
01:46:52,450 --> 01:46:54,910
A little dirty.

1205
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:57,500
Casey, sweetie, you take
your daddy's present now.

1206
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,830
No, no, no, honey.
it's okay.

1207
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,760
I got a picture,
a picture of you.

1208
01:47:08,010 --> 01:47:10,180
I got a picture
of you, too.

1209
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:13,510
Baby, I don't know
what I would do

1210
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:16,930
I'd be lost
if I lost you

1211
01:47:17,020 --> 01:47:21,690
if you ever leave

1212
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:23,360
- Baby, you would take away
- Happy birthday, darlin'.

1213
01:47:23,480 --> 01:47:28,860
Everything real
in my life

1214
01:47:30,450 --> 01:47:33,950
And tell me now

1215
01:47:34,030 --> 01:47:38,790
How do I live
without you

1216
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:41,710
I want to know

1217
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:46,000
How do I breathe
without you

1218
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:49,340
if you ever go

1219
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:52,300
How do I ever

1220
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:57,010
Ever survive

1221
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:00,060
New shooter comin' out, new shooter.
Does the new shooter feel lucky?

1222
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,560
Well, does he?

1223
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:06,860
Yes, yes he does.

1224
