1
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,720
Excuse me, can you tell me this
where Delmare Berry lives?

2
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,120
He ain't here.

3
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,479
Go on inside.

4
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:36,119
He's a friend of mine, he wrote
this address down, right here.

5
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,559
Here.

6
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:42,479
You can see that's Delmare's writing.
I sure had a hard time finding this place.

7
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,318
- That's his writin'.
- Like I said, he's a friend.

8
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,598
My name is John Rambo.
We served on the same team together in 'Nam.

9
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,959
I don't know if he ever talked about me.

10
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:57,919
I've got a picture of us together.

11
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,759
Somewhere.

12
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:03,079
This junk in my pocket!

13
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:05,158
Here... here it is.

14
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:10,237
That's me, that's Danforth,
Westmore, Bronson, Ortega,

15
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:14,318
and there's Delmare, right in the back.
Had to put him in the back because he's so big...

16
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:18,637
if we didn't, he'd take up the whole picture.
- Delmare's gone.

17
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:22,717
- What time will he be back?
- He died.

18
00:03:23,197 --> 00:03:24,958
What?

19
00:03:25,278 --> 00:03:27,078
Died last summer.

20
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,439
Died how?

21
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:34,357
Cancer. Brought it back from 'Nam.

22
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:38,677
All that orange stuff
they spread it around.

23
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:43,557
Cut him down to nothing.
I couldn't lift him off the sheets.

24
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:54,077
I'm very sorry.

25
00:04:47,715 --> 00:04:51,714
Morning Amy! How are you doing, girls?
- Great, thanks. - Alright this morning?

26
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:56,834
- Andy!
- Howdy, Will!

27
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:13,634
Good morning, Dave. - Hi, Sheriff.
- Gonna take a bath this week?

28
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,794
Morning!

29
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:29,033
You visiting someone around here?

30
00:05:30,514 --> 00:05:32,114
No.

31
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:37,114
You know, wearing that flag on your jacket,
looking the way you do...

32
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:40,873
You're asking for trouble around here, friend.

33
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:45,113
- Headed north or south?
- North.

34
00:05:46,273 --> 00:05:50,033
Jump in, I'll make sure you're
headed in the right direction.

35
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:04,033
- Where you heading?
- Portland.

36
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:06,592
Portland's is South, you said you were headed North.

37
00:06:08,311 --> 00:06:10,153
You got some place I can eat around here?

38
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,712
There's a diner about 30 miles up the highway.

39
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:21,991
- Is there a law against me getting something to eat here?
- Yeah, me.

40
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:24,711
Why are you pushing me?

41
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,712
What did you say?

42
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,952
l said why are you pushing me,
I haven't done anything to you.

43
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:34,351
First of all, you don't ask the questions
around here, I do. Understand?

44
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:39,832
Secondly, we don't want guys like you in this town.

45
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:43,111
Drifters.

46
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:48,150
First thing you know we got a whole bunch
of guys like you in this town. That's why!

47
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:53,950
Besides, you wouldn't like it here,
This is a quiet little town.

48
00:06:55,391 --> 00:06:59,951
In fact you might say it's boring.
But that's the way we like it.

49
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:02,471
And I get paid to keep it that way.

50
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,350
Boring.

51
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:22,310
Portland, straight ahead.

52
00:07:24,431 --> 00:07:26,270
If you want some friendly advice...

53
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,868
Get your hair cut and take a bath.
You wouldn't get hassled so much.

54
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,630
Hope this ride helped you out.

55
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,190
Have a nice day, huh?

56
00:08:17,948 --> 00:08:19,788
Where the hell do you think you're going?

57
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:23,589
I'm talking to you, goddammit!

58
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:29,947
Let's see some l.D.!

59
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,868
All right, you're under arrest!

60
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:34,588
Put your hands on the car.

61
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:37,508
You put your hands on the car,
and you spread them.

62
00:08:39,348 --> 00:08:41,787
You're going to put your hands on that car,

63
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:44,267
How you do it you decide, right now!

64
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:58,987
Legs back.

65
00:09:00,027 --> 00:09:01,626
Back!

66
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:06,186
You try to be nice to some people!

67
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:12,187
Well, what do we have here?

68
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:19,107
- What would you be carrying a knife like this?
- Hunting.

69
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:26,147
Don't be a wise guy!
What do you hunt with a knife?
- Name it.

70
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:33,426
Hi, Will.
- Lester.

71
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:38,385
Buzz us in, will ya.
- Hey, talk about your sorry looking humanity.

72
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:41,345
Just another smartass drifter.

73
00:09:43,505 --> 00:09:47,105
Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Will. What do you got?

74
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:53,385
I want you to book this gentleman for vagrancy,
resisting arrest carrying a concealing weapon.

75
00:09:53,864 --> 00:09:58,385
- He says he uses it for hunting.
- Huntin'? what do you hunt, elephants?

76
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,225
see if you can clean him up a little.
Smells like an animal.

77
00:10:07,584 --> 00:10:09,504
Hey, Mitch.

78
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:15,744
- Escort this young man downstairs.
- Yes sir, Mr. Galt. Right this way, partner.

79
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,904
OK, here we go.

80
00:10:30,424 --> 00:10:35,824
You know it looks like it'll take
old Leroy 10 years to paint this hall
- Why don't you paint it your damned self!!

81
00:10:36,263 --> 00:10:39,664
Leroy, sling that paint, boy.
- Mr. Ward,

82
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:43,064
Take these.
- Thank you.

83
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:52,703
Name?

84
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:58,783
Your name

85
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:15,262
If you're looking for trouble,
you came to the right place, buddy!

86
00:11:15,663 --> 00:11:17,223
Wait.

87
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:20,783
You got three seconds before I break your face in.

88
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:23,103
He means it.

89
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,062
Yeah, I do.

90
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,502
What do you know about that.
Old Harry here is a soldier

91
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,423
Rambo.

92
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,020
John J?

93
00:11:53,902 --> 00:11:56,100
You're gonna talk to me.

94
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,862
I promise you're gonna talk to me, soldier.

95
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,022
I'm starting to dislike you.

96
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,541
A lot.

97
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,660
I'm gonna run a make on him.

98
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,821
Put his name in the Teletype.

99
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,140
Just roll it across.

100
00:12:17,581 --> 00:12:19,581
Roll it across!

101
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,940
- Push it.
- It won't work that way
it'll only smear. Now, roll it across!

102
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:29,340
Look, you son of a bitch, if you don't put your
god damned hand down there, I'm gonna break it off!

103
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,619
Put it down, god dammit!
- What the hell's going on down here?

104
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,500
Nothing I can't handle

105
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:41,860
He won't let us print him well.
Leave the ink on the hand!

106
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,100
Just what is your problem?

107
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,900
As things stand right now, you're facing
the ass end of a 90 day incarceration!

108
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,939
Plus a 250 dollar fine which you don't
look to me like you can pay.

109
00:12:55,419 --> 00:13:00,260
At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning you're going up
in front of that judge. And you think we're tough!

110
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,459
We're going to make you more presentable
for your courtroom appearance.

111
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,418
Between now and then, you can just impress
the hell out of me by doing exactly as you're told.

112
00:13:15,219 --> 00:13:16,739
Clean him up.

113
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:22,017
Preston, go over there
and get that hose ready, alright?

114
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,258
Holy shit, look at this!
What the hell's he been in to?

115
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,538
Who gives a shit?

116
00:13:31,058 --> 00:13:33,898
Hands above your head and turn around.

117
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:41,737
Oh Christ, we should report this to Teasle.
Look at that!

118
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,698
You just do what I tell you.

119
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,298
Galt, what the fuck was that?

120
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:53,698
The man said 'clean him up'.

121
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,257
Clean him up!

122
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:11,937
Hey, Preston, don't forget
to get him behind the ears!

123
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,856
How'd you like that, huh?

124
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:22,697
What's the matter, Mitch,
don't you like water sports?

125
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:35,416
Hurry it up, it's time for my coffee break.
Alright, sit down.

126
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:37,536
Sit down!

127
00:14:45,094 --> 00:14:47,656
Damn it, boy's hard to get a hold of!

128
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:53,695
That's OK, Ward, don't worry about the soap, he's tough.
Just shave him. Dry!

129
00:14:55,296 --> 00:15:00,734
How blind are you? Can't you see he's crazy?
- Can't you see I don't give a shit?

130
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,455
Yeah, I can see that.
- That's better.

131
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:06,935
See there, I knew that you..

132
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:12,774
We're just going to shaving you partner, take it easy.
- Take this, Mitch.

133
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:18,254
Don't move...

134
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:20,215
I don't want you to cut your own throat.

135
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,495
You asshole!

136
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,053
What the hell....

137
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,932
I'll kill the asshole!
- Art, don't shoot!

138
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:52,370
There's people down there!
Get help! I'll go after him!

139
00:16:55,852 --> 00:16:57,690
Get out of the way!

140
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,569
Son of a bitch!

141
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,007
Lester, this is Will. I'm right on his tail.

142
00:18:45,487 --> 00:18:47,769
He's just east of Smith's farm,
headed towards Chapman Creek.

143
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,485
I know you can hear me!

144
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:12,165
You're finished!
You're gone as far as you're going to go!

145
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:17,165
D'you hear me?

146
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:26,523
He's up there behind the draw.

147
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:31,843
Mitch, get Orval on the radio. Tell him to get out
here with his damned dogs right away.

148
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:36,564
Tell him to bring the Dobermen! lt's gonna rain,
we need dogs that can hunt on sight.

149
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:40,843
Lester, tell Paul to get out to the
lumber camp to get the helicopter up here.

150
00:21:41,324 --> 00:21:45,442
If they give him any shit, tell him to site
him for obstruction right on the spot.

151
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:49,322
We'll get him.

152
00:21:49,762 --> 00:21:51,282
No problem.

153
00:22:22,321 --> 00:22:25,162
Go on, Hooch! Thunder, lets get him!

154
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:27,400
Come on sweethearts

155
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,081
We'll get him!

156
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,041
Won't be long before he's stuffed and mounted.
- make him into a bear rug.

157
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:40,360
Didn't we go hunting here last year?
Ya I got a couple of bucks last year.

158
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,639
Mitch, up the hill!

159
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,800
Get these hounds away from me, Orval!
I don't trust those bastards.

160
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,918
Keep moving, my dogs can eat
and run at the same time!

161
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:15,039
He's going straight to the top.
- Isn't that supposed to be dangerous? - He's just dumb!

162
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,278
Hey, you're spoiling the scent.
Let my babies do their job!

163
00:23:37,838 --> 00:23:40,200
This is no good.
- Why?

164
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,039
there were three of us in the cell block down there.
He went through us like we weren't even there.

165
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,039
Come on!

166
00:24:56,835 --> 00:25:01,794
We've got him, he's trapped!
- Art, he's heading for Chapman's gorge.

167
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:04,115
Head him off!

168
00:25:37,674 --> 00:25:39,394
There he is! On the cliff!

169
00:25:56,193 --> 00:25:57,953
Son of a bitch?

170
00:26:05,154 --> 00:26:06,794
What the hell's going on?

171
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,154
What are you doing?
We're just supposed to spot him!

172
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:13,394
Hold it steady.
- I can't, we're in a thermal draft.

173
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:16,753
He's stuck there, he can't go any place.

174
00:26:17,234 --> 00:26:22,514
If you don't ride this thing right
I swear to God, I'll kill you!

175
00:26:24,632 --> 00:26:26,193
Sheriff to Galt! Come in Galt.

176
00:26:31,232 --> 00:26:32,673
Hold it steady, you son of a bitch!

177
00:26:33,152 --> 00:26:35,313
Galt, come in, God damn it!

178
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:40,712
Get closer and hold it steady!
- Galt, talk to me! I want to know what's going on.

179
00:26:43,912 --> 00:26:47,872
I got him... easy now.

180
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:34,069
Over there, dummy! Come on!

181
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:40,711
Hey, soldier boy!

182
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,549
Galt, get on this radio! What's going on up there?

183
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,310
I don't want him dead, Galt, I want him alive!
You hear me? Art, come in!

184
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:08,628
Art Galt, come in!
Helicopter, come, dammit!

185
00:29:09,307 --> 00:29:11,068
Christ, look!

186
00:29:13,707 --> 00:29:16,626
Jesus Christ, give me the binoculars!

187
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,467
Oh no! Shit!

188
00:30:04,906 --> 00:30:09,586
- I can't figure it. How did fall out?
- Does it matter?

189
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:12,586
Let's nail this sucker's ass...
he can't be far.

190
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,746
Look!

191
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:18,785
Looks like he wants to turn himself in.

192
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:26,665
There's one man is dead. lt's not my fault.
I don't want any more hurt.

193
00:30:27,145 --> 00:30:28,785
Freeze!

194
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:30,944
Stay there and give yourself up!

195
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:33,226
But I didn't do anything!

196
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:35,825
I'm warning you, boy, don't make a move, I'll blow your head off!

197
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:38,305
I didn't do anything!

198
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:45,145
Cease fire!

199
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:48,626
Ward, God damn it, cease fire!

200
00:30:49,825 --> 00:30:52,744
I think we hit him.
Let's get down there. Move

201
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:56,224
Sheriff to base, come in.

202
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:01,184
Go ahead, Will?

203
00:31:01,184 --> 00:31:05,760
Lester, we're down in the gorge. Galt's dead alright.

204
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:07,775
Where the hell is that god damned chopper?

205
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:10,984
He won't come, Will. Says there's a storm heading your way.

206
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:15,088
I don't give a god damned what's on its way.
I want the chopper back here right now!

207
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,543
I don't want Galt's body out here all night.

208
00:31:17,984 --> 00:31:20,662
You sure picked one hell of a guy to mess around with.

209
00:31:21,143 --> 00:31:24,902
Just came over the Teletype a few minutes ago.
John Rambo is a Vietnam vet,

210
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,022
A Green Beret, Congressional medal of honor.
Guy's a war hero.

211
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:33,061
- Jesus, that freak?
- I knew there was something about that guy!

212
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:37,238
I double checked it, Will.
What do you want me to do?

213
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:45,223
I want you to do what told you to do.
Dod damn it. Get that chopper back here now, out.

214
00:31:49,165 --> 00:31:50,638
A Green Beret!

215
00:31:50,966 --> 00:31:52,887
War hero!

216
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:56,414
- That's great! That's just great!
- Shut your mouth!

217
00:31:57,063 --> 00:32:00,901
What the hell's the matter with you guys?
He's one man... wounded.

218
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:05,004
Those Green Berets... they're real bad asses.

219
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:09,100
Why don't you let the State Police handle this?

220
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,541
Come here! Goddammit!

221
00:32:14,964 --> 00:32:18,869
Look. Look at him!
That's Art Galt, boy!

222
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:22,989
He and I were friends when your momma
was still wiping your nose!

223
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:28,101
Now he's dead. Because of that psycho
out there! Now you listen good:

224
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:33,997
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch and I'm gonna pin
that Congressional medal of honor to his liver.

225
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:38,540
And I'm gonna do it with you
or without you.

226
00:32:55,301 --> 00:33:00,260
We're closin' in, the scent's getting
stronger. - Keep your eyes open.

227
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,580
It's going to storm, that's all we need now!
Will, let's get out of here before it gets dark.

228
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:12,740
What's the matter, you afraid of the boogie man?
You god damned pansy.

229
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:16,100
Put your gun down, I'll show you who the pansy is.

230
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:22,940
Knock it off! Ward, move out! The fight is out here!
He's out there waiting for you.

231
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,819
Mitch, get on your feet and move!

232
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:30,499
Go find this guy for Chrissakes!
Keep your eyes open!

233
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:34,100
See you later, Ward!
- Shut up, Mitch.

234
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,779
There he is!

235
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,978
Let them dogs loose, Orval!

236
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:48,740
Go get em sweethearts!
There's your dinner

237
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,297
Cease fire!

238
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:06,617
Goddammit I'm hit!

239
00:34:10,578 --> 00:34:12,578
Jesus, he's got a gun.

240
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:22,576
That's not him, it's a God damned scarecrow.

241
00:34:23,216 --> 00:34:26,337
No scarecrow that shot Orville, he's close.

242
00:34:26,737 --> 00:34:30,297
Kill him! Go get him!

243
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,818
Go get him, Maggie!

244
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,858
Mitch, Ward, come here!
Shingleton, you cover us.

245
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:51,976
Look at his leg! - Mitch, get your belt. Make a
tourniquet around that.

246
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:56,096
We got to get this guy to a doctor.
- Get your belt on that fast! Where's the first-aid kit?

247
00:34:56,576 --> 00:35:01,376
I left it in the car. Shit! Where did he
get that gun? - It's Galt's gun.

248
00:35:01,818 --> 00:35:03,931
He's out of ammo..
- How do you know that?

249
00:35:03,932 --> 00:35:07,768
- Because whatever killed that dog was no bullet.
That's how.  Hurry up.

250
00:35:07,856 --> 00:35:11,272
Orval, listen. You have to stay awake.

251
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:14,411
You got to release the tourniquet every 15 minutes.
We'll be right back.

252
00:35:14,507 --> 00:35:17,192
We got to get him now. He's out of ammo.
Hurry up.  Move

253
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:21,736
He had no right to shoot my babies.
Get the son of a bitch!

254
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:25,800
OK, listen up

255
00:35:26,216 --> 00:35:29,632
We're right on top of him. We're going to form
a skirmish line, 50 feet apart.

256
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:33,053
And keep moving, there's no way out
of here, except through us.

257
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:38,062
OK, let's do some huntin'

258
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:42,181
Huntin'? We ain't huntin' him,
he's huntin' us!

259
00:35:55,295 --> 00:35:58,615
Spread out, dammit!
I said 50 feet!

260
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,614
I hate this!

261
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,772
Will, it's Mitch!

262
00:37:42,651 --> 00:37:44,331
Who is it?

263
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,010
What's up here?
- Shut up!

264
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,410
He's got Ward.
Spread out, I'll go this way.

265
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,450
Who's firing?

266
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:40,050
Who's firing there?
- I got him!

267
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,288
Shingleton, follow me!

268
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:45,370
I got him!

269
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,608
Help me!

270
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:50,768
Help me, Will!

271
00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:57,729
Balford? Where the hell are you?

272
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,528
Shingleton, over here!

273
00:39:15,808 --> 00:39:17,968
Easy now.
- Get me out of here!

274
00:39:27,169 --> 00:39:29,806
Shingleton, where the hell are you?

275
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:55,608
I could have killed them all.
I could have killed you.

276
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:58,967
In town you're the law, out here, it's me.

277
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:01,086
Don't push it.

278
00:40:01,526 --> 00:40:05,287
Don't push it, or I'll give you a war
you won't believe.

279
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,047
Let it go.

280
00:40:09,926 --> 00:40:11,926
Let it go.

281
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:01,165
Move back.

282
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:15,124
How bad is the situation? Captain...

283
00:41:15,524 --> 00:41:19,005
That's the only good thing about this business,
is the business you're doing in town.

284
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:22,203
Reporters are drinking the place dry.

285
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:29,364
You look like you're ready to keel over, Will.
Why don't you go home. It's my problem now.

286
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:34,604
Your problem? Listen Dave, don't give me any of your horsehit
about jurisdiction in this one, you understand?

287
00:41:35,004 --> 00:41:38,484
- Would you like me to step outside?
- Finish up what you're doing.

288
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:42,484
Somewhere in this rugged mountain countryside,
possibly above the snow line,

289
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:46,324
shrouded in mist,
the fugitive, John Rambo, is hiding.

290
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:51,603
Units of the state police along with local members
of the national guard are now being mobilized.

291
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:59,217
What still remains unexplained by the local authorities
is just how and where the former green beret
came into possession of the weapons

292
00:41:59,273 --> 00:42:01,274
with which he allegedly killed one deputy sheriff

293
00:42:01,283 --> 00:42:06,779
and tried to kill 6 others. Only their skilled training
in police enforcement techniques saved their lives.

294
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:11,162
And word now is that the fugitive will be
in custody an a matter of hours.

295
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:14,738
Maps Will.

296
00:42:14,922 --> 00:42:17,442
Will, there's something you ought to know.

297
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:19,993
Talk to you later, OK?

298
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:23,258
What is it, Lester?
For Christ sake, spit it out!

299
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:27,042
I was just talking to Mitch.

300
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:32,873
and he was saying that Galt and a couple
of deputies were a little hard on the guy.

301
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,449
Assholes!

302
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:39,242
Doesn't make one god dammed bit of difference.
Dave, and you know it!

303
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:45,577
If one of my deputies gets out of line with a
prisoner then the prisoner comes to me with it!

304
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:48,801
And if I find out it's like he says, I kick the deputy's ass!

305
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:51,360
Me, the law!
And that's the way it's gotta be.

306
00:42:52,161 --> 00:42:56,162
People start fucking around with
the law and all hell breaks loose.

307
00:42:57,601 --> 00:43:03,241
- Whatever possessed God in heaven to make a man like Rambo?
- God didn't make Rambo,

308
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,361
I made him.

309
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:06,881
Who the hell are you?

310
00:43:06,921 --> 00:43:10,001
Sam Trautman. Colonel Samuel Trautman.

311
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:12,639
We're a little busy this morning, colonel,
what can we do for you?

312
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,080
- I've come to get my boy.
- Your boy?

313
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,960
I recruited him, I trained him,
I commanded him in Vietnam for 3 years.

314
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,000
I'd say that makes him mine.

315
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:26,880
I wonder why the Pentagon would send
a full bird a colonel to handle this?

316
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,160
The army thought I might be able to help.

317
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,120
I don't know in what way. Rambo's
a civilian now, he's my problem.

318
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,680
I don't think you understand.
I didn't come here to rescue Rambo from you.

319
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,959
I came to rescue you from him.

320
00:43:42,279 --> 00:43:46,720
Well, we all appreciate your concern, Colonel.
We'll try to be extra careful.

321
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,799
- I'm just amazed he allowed any of your posse to live.
- Is that right?

322
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,398
Strictly speaking, he slipped up.
You're lucky to be breathing.

323
00:43:55,878 --> 00:44:01,558
Great! Colonel, you came out here to find out
why one of your machines blew a gasket.

324
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,560
You don't want to except the fact that you're
dealing with an expert in guerilla warfare.

325
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:11,438
With a man who's the best. With guns,
with knives, with his bare hands.

326
00:44:11,878 --> 00:44:16,038
An man who was trained to
ignore pain, ignore weather,

327
00:44:16,478 --> 00:44:20,480
To live off the land... to eat things
that would make a billy goat puke.

328
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:26,359
In Vietnam, his job was to dispose of
enemy personnel, to kill... period.

329
00:44:26,837 --> 00:44:30,718
Win by attrition.
Well, Rambo was the best!

330
00:45:24,636 --> 00:45:29,796
OK, Colonel, now you've got us all scared to death, what do you
and the special forces think

331
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:33,635
we do with the psycho out there?
- Let him go.

332
00:45:34,116 --> 00:45:36,194
- Do what?
- For now.

333
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:41,676
Defuse the whole situation, defuse him.
Provide a little gap and let him slip through it.

334
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:46,715
Then put out a nation wide APB.
In a couple of weeks you'll pick him up in Seattle or someplace,
working in a car wash.

335
00:45:47,155 --> 00:45:48,954
There'll be no fight and nobody else will get hurt.

336
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:54,316
I do my own work. I don't figure the best way to do that is
to close my eyes and hope he gets picked up in Seattle!

337
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:56,715
If you send your people in there after him, they'll get killed.

338
00:45:57,195 --> 00:46:03,858
We're just a small hick town sheriff's department,
colonel, but we're expected to do our duty
just like our heroes in the special forces.

339
00:46:03,915 --> 00:46:08,394
- In Special Forces, we teach our people
to stay alive in the line of duty.
- No shit, I never thought of that!

340
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:14,403
- You want a war that you can't win?
- You telling me that 200 men against your boy
is a no win situation for us?

341
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:19,714
You send that many, don't forget one thing.
- What?
- A good supply of body-bags!

342
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:23,914
Trautman...

343
00:46:25,474 --> 00:46:31,154
I don't know what side you're on, Trautman,
I still think you came out here just to cover your ass.

344
00:46:31,434 --> 00:46:36,034
But if you're serious about taking Rambo clean, follow me.

345
00:46:55,553 --> 00:46:58,633
State police calling John Rambo.
Acknowledge.

346
00:47:05,075 --> 00:47:09,554
State police calling John Rambo.
Come in please. Acknowledge!

347
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:15,472
If you're listening, Rambo, here's
your situation: you are surrounded,

348
00:47:15,913 --> 00:47:20,833
Every possible exit has been blocked,
every highway, every road, every fire break.

349
00:47:21,273 --> 00:47:26,153
You have our word that your services
to your country will be taken into consideration.
And you'll receive fair treatment.

350
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:31,151
- Just respond, we can work everything out... over
- Anything?

351
00:47:31,753 --> 00:47:34,832
- He took a radio off one of my deputies.
- Then he has to be listening.

352
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:39,950
If I was in his position, I would try to pick up
some information. Maybe catch some cross talk.
- Of course he's listening!

353
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:45,432
- He's not going to break radio silence.
- No, not for us, but he might do it for you, Colonel.

354
00:47:46,031 --> 00:47:48,511
He's your boy, isn't he?

355
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:54,190
maybe you can talk him into sparing
all our lives by giving himself up.

356
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:56,190
I can try.

357
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:59,631
At least we'd get a radio fix on his position
if you don't mind setting him up for us.

358
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:04,711
Setting him up for you?
That's like bringing the pigeons to the cat.

359
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:11,391
- Thanks for bringing your people out.
- Any time, Will.

360
00:48:11,871 --> 00:48:16,352
Come on, Bobby, put the magazine away and pay attention.
We may only get one crack at this.

361
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:25,229
Company leader calling Raven.
Come on Raven.

362
00:48:27,751 --> 00:48:32,110
Company leader calling Raven.

363
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,510
Company leader to Raven,
talk to me, Johnny.

364
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:39,870
Company leader to identify Baker Team:

365
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:44,590
Rambo, Messner, Ortega, Coletta,

366
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,949
Jorgensen, Danforth, Berry, Krakauer.

367
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:51,949
Confirm.

368
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,989
This is Colonel Trautman.

369
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,509
Talk to me, Johnny.

370
00:49:10,628 --> 00:49:12,269
They're all gone, Sir.

371
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:16,429
- That's him, get on it.
- Rambo. Are you alright? Over.

372
00:49:16,868 --> 00:49:19,228
Baker team, they're all dead, sir.

373
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,548
Not Delmare Berry, he made it.

374
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:24,949
Berry's gone too, sir.

375
00:49:25,828 --> 00:49:27,428
How?

376
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:32,188
Got himself killed in 'Nam...
Didn't even know it. Cancer ate him down to the bone.

377
00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:35,508
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

378
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:38,349
I'm the last one, sir.

379
00:49:39,108 --> 00:49:42,829
lt's good to hear your voice, Johnny,
it's been a long time.

380
00:49:43,908 --> 00:49:48,828
Look, John, you've done some damage here, but they
don't want any more trouble. - He's North-west.

381
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:53,067
That's why I've come.
I'm gonna come in and fly you the hell out.

382
00:49:53,508 --> 00:49:57,387
Just you and me. We'll work this out together.
Is that fair enough?

383
00:49:58,348 --> 00:50:01,186
- Where'd you come from, Sir?
- Bragg.

384
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:05,708
I tried to get in touch with you but the guys
at Bragg never knew where to find you.

385
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:10,988
Well, I haven't been spending much time there lately,
they've got me down in DC. I'm shining a seat with my ass.

386
00:50:11,171 --> 00:50:13,706
I wish I was back in Bragg now.

387
00:50:16,386 --> 00:50:20,787
- We'll talk about that when you come in.
- I can't do that, Sir.

388
00:50:22,747 --> 00:50:26,227
Well, look, John, we can't have you running around
out there wasting friendlies and civilians.

389
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:30,426
- There are no friendly civilians.
- I'm your friend, Johnny.

390
00:50:30,866 --> 00:50:35,827
I was there with you, knee deep in blood and guts.
I covered your ass more than once.

391
00:50:38,706 --> 00:50:41,585
Seems like bailing you out of trouble
is becoming a life long job for me.

392
00:50:42,066 --> 00:50:44,426
There wouldn't be any trouble if it wasn't for that king shit cop.

393
00:50:45,225 --> 00:50:47,627
All I wanted was something to eat.

394
00:50:48,106 --> 00:50:52,426
- But the man kept pushing sir.
- You did some pushing on your own, John.

395
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:56,786
They drew first blood, not me.

396
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:00,585
Let me come in and get you the hell out of there.

397
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:03,105
They drew first blood.

398
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:12,585
Rambo, are you still reading me?

399
00:51:16,705 --> 00:51:18,304
Company leader to Raven!

400
00:51:19,585 --> 00:51:21,106
Rambo, acknowledge!

401
00:51:22,225 --> 00:51:24,145
He's finished, Colonel

402
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:29,225
We've got a real good fix on him though. Come first light,
I'm gonna put every man I got up on that ridge.

403
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:32,104
Then we'll get him my way.

404
00:51:37,383 --> 00:51:38,984
Dammit.

405
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,423
God dammit!

406
00:51:51,303 --> 00:51:52,982
Come on move it!

407
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,383
Does the guy got a gun?

408
00:53:07,622 --> 00:53:11,500
There's the guy the cops are shootin' at.
- I see him! - I'll get him.

409
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:14,181
Don't shoot!

410
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:15,901
This way! Let's go!

411
00:53:21,822 --> 00:53:23,861
There he is! Come on!

412
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,661
Now we got him!

413
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,461
Yes, I know exactly where it is.
Now listen to me very carefully!

414
00:53:48,462 --> 00:53:52,395
Surround the area with every man you got,
but don't move in.

415
00:53:52,642 --> 00:53:57,019
Don't do anything till I get there!
And no shooting! I don't want him dead, I want him alive!

416
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,898
Keep firing!

417
00:54:17,898 --> 00:54:19,780
Go on, guys, shoot!

418
00:54:20,938 --> 00:54:22,740
Come on!

419
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:25,737
You guys are great!

420
00:54:26,218 --> 00:54:30,460
Steve. I want you and Bruce, head around
these trees go to the front of that mine.

421
00:54:30,899 --> 00:54:33,939
Screw that, Clinton, I ain't goin up there!
- No way!

422
00:54:38,098 --> 00:54:42,177
Brandon, I want you to go into that mine.
- Not me.

423
00:54:43,058 --> 00:54:46,923
What do you mean, not me?
- I do this part time, I didn't come here to get killed.

424
00:54:46,939 --> 00:54:51,099
Now he's probably waiting for us.
What's wrong with you, Clinton?

425
00:54:54,817 --> 00:54:58,697
Rambo?
This is Lieutenant Clinton Morgan.

426
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:02,057
National Guard leader.

427
00:55:02,497 --> 00:55:06,937
I'm giving you just 3 zero seconds
to come on out.

428
00:55:08,777 --> 00:55:12,538
Who's got the rocket launcher?
- I do. - Come here, Earl.

429
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:18,057
Rambo. This is your last chance to come out!

430
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,017
Maybe we should wait.

431
00:55:21,457 --> 00:55:26,216
Earl, this creep is a killer! Besides,
I'm in charge and I say we blow it up.

432
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:30,777
Now fire that thing!
Just let me get out of the way first.

433
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,055
Give that man a cigar!

434
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:58,296
Bull's eye!

435
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:38,974
- Where the hell are they?
- Up the hill about 500 yards.

436
00:56:42,255 --> 00:56:44,414
Move in a little closer just like Iwa Jima.

437
00:56:46,374 --> 00:56:48,813
I don't believe it! Idiots!

438
00:56:49,693 --> 00:56:53,654
One more for ''Soldier of Fortune''!

439
00:56:54,014 --> 00:56:58,174
What the hell do you think this is... some kind of circus?
Get the hell out of here!

440
00:56:59,694 --> 00:57:04,814
Clinton, Jesus! Didn't you get the word, Clinton,
I told you people to wait until I got up here.

441
00:57:05,253 --> 00:57:09,094
Well, he was shooting at us, Will!
I wasn't taking any chances.

442
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:12,573
What a mess.

443
00:57:14,053 --> 00:57:16,973
We have to dig his body out of there right away.

444
00:57:17,453 --> 00:57:20,852
You can't get a dozer up here,
you have to find somebody to dig him out.

445
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:26,012
- lt's your mess, Clinton! You clean it up.
- Will, come on... I gotta be back at the drug store tomorrow.

446
00:57:26,052 --> 00:57:28,933
You'd better get started right away, Clinton!

447
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,931
Buried in a hole by a bunch of
God damned weekend warriors!

448
00:58:19,971 --> 00:58:22,373
Though you said he was the best you ever trained.

449
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:25,731
However he may have ended up, there
was a time when he was very special.

450
00:58:25,769 --> 00:58:30,891
'Special' my ass. He's just another drifter that broke the law.
- Vagrancy, wasn't it?

451
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:35,690
That's gonna look real great on his gravestone
in Arlington: ''Here lies John Rambo,

452
00:58:35,731 --> 00:58:37,970
winner of the Congressional medal of honor.

453
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:41,850
survivor of countless incursions behind enemy lines

454
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:44,731
killed for vagrancy in Jerkwater, USA''

455
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:51,249
Don't give me any of that crap, Trautman!
You think Rambo was the only guy
who had a tough time in Vietnam.

456
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:56,329
- He killed a police officer for Christ sake!
- You're god damned lucky he didn't kill all of you.

457
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:18,489
This character! He comes waltzing in here
full of all kinds of good advice.
I wish we'd let that god damned maniac go loose...

458
00:59:18,529 --> 00:59:23,688
so we could save our own asses!
Well, we saved our asses, Colonel.
And we didn't let him go loose.

459
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:28,289
The best man lost!
And he doesn't like it!

460
01:00:57,366 --> 01:01:00,566
- How are you doin', Will?
- Hold my calls.

461
01:03:20,402 --> 01:03:22,080
Have a seat.

462
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:32,120
Miss, can you do this again, please.
- Sure. - And for my friend...?

463
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,960
A shot of wild turkey.

464
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:41,282
If I was out of line before,
I just want to apologize.

465
01:03:43,161 --> 01:03:45,921
None of that makes much difference now, does it?

466
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,601
No, I guess not.

467
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,961
I suppose

468
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,001
I just feel...

469
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:01,159
Like you were cheated out of your chance?

470
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,239
I wanted to kill that kid.

471
01:04:04,759 --> 01:04:07,640
I wanted to kill him so bad, I could taste it.

472
01:04:08,999 --> 01:04:10,800
Doesn't sit well with that badge.

473
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:14,360
It can get confusing sometimes.

474
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:21,639
In Vietnam you can bet that Rambo and I got pretty confused.
But we had orders.

475
01:04:22,257 --> 01:04:25,440
When in doubt, kill.

476
01:04:28,752 --> 01:04:34,871
But what the hell, you're a civilian. You can go home
to your wife, your house and flower garden.

477
01:04:34,927 --> 01:04:37,594
-You're under no pressure to figure all this out.
- What about you colonel,

478
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:42,438
what did you figure out from all of this?
What would you have done with him if he came in?

479
01:04:42,479 --> 01:04:45,471
Would you wrap your arms around him
give him a big sloppy kiss?

480
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,982
Or would you have blown his brains out?

481
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:58,998
I couldn't answer that until
I met him face to face.

482
01:05:01,655 --> 01:05:04,198
Well, there it is.

483
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:09,237
Just as well we never got a chance to find out.

484
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:56,914
Drive!

485
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:02,362
Don't look at me, look at the road.
That's how accidents happen.

486
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:06,833
What's your name?
- Cathcart, Robert A.

487
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:10,873
- What do you got in the back, Robert A.?
- M60

488
01:07:14,274 --> 01:07:20,834
OK, Robert A., get out of the truck.
- I don't got no beef with you.
- Go home!

489
01:07:42,873 --> 01:07:45,233
Want to turn that up?

490
01:07:48,553 --> 01:07:50,712
What's your story, Steamboat?

491
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:56,833
Looks like somebody pulled the plug too soon.
That Rambo guy? He's on the loose again.

492
01:08:00,752 --> 01:08:03,752
Hey Will, it's Rambo! He's still around

493
01:11:35,865 --> 01:11:39,225
- Holy fuck!
- Get out there right away. Move!

494
01:12:03,465 --> 01:12:05,465
What the hell's going on?

495
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:11,104
Watch yourselves!
- They're all gonna blow!

496
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:22,703
Attention, all civilians!

497
01:12:23,542 --> 01:12:27,382
For your own safety
please evacuate the streets immediately.

498
01:12:28,544 --> 01:12:32,864
Remain indoors until you receive further instructions. I repeat:

499
01:12:33,024 --> 01:12:37,263
This is a police emergency.
Please evacuate the streets immediately.

500
01:12:54,663 --> 01:12:56,583
They found Rambo's body.

501
01:12:59,063 --> 01:13:03,183
lt stole a truck and blew up a gas
station on the other side of town.

502
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,301
The kid is resilient.

503
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:08,744
Why don't you forget what you're thinking
and clear out while you can.

504
01:13:08,841 --> 01:13:12,677
- Get the fuck out of here Trautman
and take your advice with you.

505
01:13:12,869 --> 01:13:17,382
When I talked to you earlier this afternoon,
you knew he was still alive, didn't you?

506
01:13:17,662 --> 01:13:19,342
I suspected it.

507
01:13:19,382 --> 01:13:24,142
Sure, that's why you stuck around.
You trained him.

508
01:13:24,423 --> 01:13:27,222
You taught him how to get out of places like that cave.

509
01:13:27,702 --> 01:13:29,543
But he's not going to get out of this place.

510
01:13:29,982 --> 01:13:35,102
Teasle, you and all your men couldn't handle him before,
what makes you think you can handle him now?

511
01:13:35,181 --> 01:13:38,221
Because God knows what damage he's prepared to do.

512
01:13:48,701 --> 01:13:50,741
You're going to die, Teasle.

513
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:52,381
Everybody dies!

514
01:13:53,419 --> 01:13:57,940
There's only one man in this room that has a half a chance.
That's not because I'm better than he is.

515
01:13:57,981 --> 01:13:59,861
But it's because he trusts me.

516
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:04,581
See, I'm the closest thing to family that he has left,
and that may be all the edge I need.

517
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,621
Jesus Christ, where do you people come from?

518
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,740
This is my job, Trautman,
this is my town!

519
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:18,739
I'm not giving it up to you,
or to Rambo or anybody else!

520
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:21,941
You just stay the hell out of my way!

521
01:14:30,858 --> 01:14:32,859
- Get a little closer!
- I can't

522
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:36,060
lt's too God damned hot!

523
01:14:36,098 --> 01:14:39,779
Will, it's Lester, do you copy, over?

524
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:43,939
Come on, let's go!
Will, this is Lester, do you copy, over?

525
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:48,899
We've got some serious problems.
The highway's been cut off.

526
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:52,019
The truck's out here,
but we couldn't find the body.

527
01:14:52,459 --> 01:14:56,939
I repeat, no body, lt's totally burnt out.
Preston, get those people out of here...

528
01:14:57,059 --> 01:15:00,018
Move them back to the south side.

529
01:15:00,498 --> 01:15:05,058
We don't know how many gas tanks
there are under the pumps...

530
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:45,569
Go ahead, go ahead!

531
01:20:46,288 --> 01:20:49,368
- Go ahead you crazy son of a bitch!
- Rambo!

532
01:20:50,288 --> 01:20:51,767
Rambo, don't do it!

533
01:20:52,687 --> 01:20:54,207
Listen to me, Rambo!

534
01:20:54,288 --> 01:20:56,248
You have no chance.

535
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:58,367
Drop your weapon.

536
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:02,887
We're going to order a chopper in
and fly you back to Bragg.

537
01:21:04,687 --> 01:21:06,848
Hold your fire!

538
01:21:07,646 --> 01:21:11,048
- Yeah?
- Hold your fire!

539
01:21:14,206 --> 01:21:17,246
Think about what you're doing.

540
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:20,725
The building's perimeter's covered.
No exits.

541
01:21:21,365 --> 01:21:23,965
There's nearly 200 men out there and a lot of M16s!

542
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,767
You did everything to make this private war happen.

543
01:21:27,886 --> 01:21:33,366
You've done enough damage!
This mission is over, you understand me?

544
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,646
This mission is over!

545
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:40,445
Look at them out there.

546
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:44,086
Look at them!

547
01:21:46,566 --> 01:21:49,685
If you don't end this now,
they're going to kill you.

548
01:21:49,724 --> 01:21:51,166
Is that what you want?

549
01:21:54,366 --> 01:21:57,364
lt's over, Johnny. lt's over!

550
01:21:57,444 --> 01:22:02,484
Nothing is over! Nothing!
You just don't turn it off!

551
01:22:02,525 --> 01:22:06,445
lt wasn't my war.
You asked me, I didn't ask you!

552
01:22:06,524 --> 01:22:10,085
I did everything I had to do to win,
but someone wouldn't let us win.

553
01:22:10,126 --> 01:22:14,925
Then I come back to the world and I see all those
maggots at the airport protesting me, spitting.

554
01:22:14,964 --> 01:22:19,284
Calling me baby killer and all that vile crap!

555
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:21,855
Who are they to protest me? Who are they?

556
01:22:21,856 --> 01:22:25,051
Unless they've been me and been there and know
what the hell they're yelling about?

557
01:22:25,061 --> 01:22:28,484
It was a bad time for everyone, Rambo,
it's all in the past now.

558
01:22:28,524 --> 01:22:33,404
For you! For me, civilian life is nothing.
In the field, we had a code of honor.

559
01:22:33,445 --> 01:22:36,846
You watch my back, I watch yours.
Back here, there's nothing!

560
01:22:36,884 --> 01:22:40,524
You're the last of an elite group,
don't end it like this.

561
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:45,124
Back there I can fly a gun ship, I can drive a tank,
I was in charge of a million dollar equipment.

562
01:22:45,164 --> 01:22:48,764
Back here I can't even hold a job parking cars!

563
01:22:57,724 --> 01:22:59,642
Where is everybody?

564
01:23:04,723 --> 01:23:08,082
I had a friend who was there for us.

565
01:23:09,001 --> 01:23:13,163
There were all these guys, man.
Back there were all these fuckin guys!

566
01:23:13,603 --> 01:23:15,122
who were my friends!

567
01:23:15,163 --> 01:23:19,483
back here there's nothing!
Remember Dan Forest?

568
01:23:19,963 --> 01:23:23,842
Wore this black headband.
I took one of his magic markers, and I said "if found...

569
01:23:24,322 --> 01:23:26,748
mail this to Las Vegas",
because we were always talking about Vegas.

570
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:31,893
And this fucking car. this red 58 Chevy convertible
he was talking about his car

571
01:23:31,894 --> 01:23:35,731
he said he would cruise till the tires fell off.

572
01:23:42,402 --> 01:23:47,762
In one of these barns a kid came up
this kid carrying a shoe shine box.

573
01:23:48,242 --> 01:23:50,242
''Shine please, shine?''

574
01:23:50,281 --> 01:23:53,401
He kept on asking. Joe said ya.

575
01:23:54,441 --> 01:23:59,202
I went to get a couple of beers.
And the box was wired. He opened up the box...

576
01:23:59,642 --> 01:24:02,120
Fucking blew his body all over the place.

577
01:24:02,601 --> 01:24:06,401
He's laying there and he's fucking screaming...
there's pieces of him all over me!

578
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:10,921
And I'm trying to pull them off, you know...
my friend! it's all over me!

579
01:24:11,401 --> 01:24:15,161
I got blood and everything and...
I'm trying to hold him together, I put him together

580
01:24:15,202 --> 01:24:17,082
the fucking entrails keep coming out!

581
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,239
And nobody would help!

582
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,600
They only go ''I want to go home!''
just calling my name.

583
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,641
''I want to go home, Johnny!
I want to drive my Chevy!

584
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,602
But I couldn't find his legs.

585
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:32,280
''I can't find your legs!''

586
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:37,201
I can't get it out of my head.
lt was seven years.

587
01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:39,120
Every day it hurts.

588
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,880
Sometimes I wake up and don't know
where I am. I don't talk to anybody.

589
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,840
Sometimes a day.

590
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:51,239
Sometimes a week.

591
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,960
I can't put it out of my mind.
