00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,955
Une biere, s'il vous plaît.

3
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,398
Merci.

4
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,993
<i>We are closed.</i>

5
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,752
<i>Just a small drink.</i>

6
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,156
<i>The toilets?</i>

7
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,515
<i>A quick drink and then I'll leave.</i>

8
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,231
Why are you rushing off?

9
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,397
- Hmm?
- I said, why are you rushing off?

10
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,118
<i>I don't understand.</i>

11
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,231
The man from Bristol called ya.

12
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,268
- What man?
- The man in the wheelchair.

13
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,749
What were you doing back here?

14
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,633
Lady,

15
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,156
I never walk into a place
I don't know how to walk out of.

16
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,151
Then why would you get into that van?

17
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,549
You know the reason.

18
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,794
Make yourselves at home.

19
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,314
You've come a long way.

20
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,278
- Thanks for coming.
- What's the job?

21
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,995
There's some people
who have something we require.

22
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,396
- And we want you to get it from them.
- It involves shooting?

23
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,948
You must be tired.

24
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,156
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

25
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,513
Seven fat years
and seven lean years.

26
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,319
- That's what it says in the Bible.
- You ever kill anybody?

27
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,868
I hurt somebody's feelings once.

28
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,832
Don't I know you?

29
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,150
I don't think so. I'd remember.

30
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,797
Okay, two-hour shifts.

31
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,514
I'll watch the front,
you guys watch the back.

32
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,193
Merci.

33
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,317
You awake, then?

34
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,548
Hmm?

35
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,757
How we doin'?

36
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,713
Yep.

37
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,031
You labour or management?

38
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,119
If I was management,
I wouldn't have given you a cigarette.

39
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,639
I am the tour guide.
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

40
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,359
Over here, the Louvre.
Over there, les toilettes.

41
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,710
What do I call you?

42
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,434
- My name is Vincent.
- Sam.

43
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,036
As per the agreement,
your salary will be $5,000 a week

44
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,680
with a minimum
of four weeks' work.

45
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,109
On the successful completion
of the mission,

46
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,915
you will each receive
a bonus of $20,000.

47
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,233
And by the way,
my name is Deirdre.

48
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,153
- The broad outlines of the mission are...
- Who are your principals?

49
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,032
For you,
there's no one but myself.

50
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,071
Huh?

51
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,038
And what can we infer
from your charming Irish lilt?

52
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,118
- Anything you like.
- Where's the equipment?

53
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,674
Tell me what you need, make a list,
and give it to Vincent.

54
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,877
- Some of the equipment's quite technical.
- If it's in Paris, I'll find it.

55
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,316
This is what we're after.

56
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,228
We need to take it intact from several
men who'll be intent on preventing us.

57
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,510
- How many men?
- You American?

58
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,309
I think the group will be between
five and eight. No more than eight.

59
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,797
- You don't know for sure?
- Not now but I will know before the event.

60
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:59,270
If you don't know,
why say between five and eight?

61
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,191
There's two to three cars.
The group's travellin'.

62
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,599
- They're not in Paris?
- No.

63
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,556
Where are they?

64
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,148
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's in the case?

65
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,633
Our plan, in broad strokes, is an ambush.

66
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,194
It's to hit the car,
to take them in transit.

67
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,915
- Transit? City? Country?
- Right now, as I said, I don't know.

68
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,309
But we've to move very quickly.

69
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,678
We'll start with this: Ambush
and assault on two to three vehicles,

70
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,276
five to eight men, and our objective
is the safe retrieval of this case.

71
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,909
Tell Vincent
what it is you'll need.

72
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,676
What do we know about them?
Are they French? Who are they?

73
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,957
All you need to know right now
is that they're very unpleasant.

74
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,471
- You've done this kind of thing before?
- You know...

75
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,629
How difficult can it be?

76
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,756
We have no idea
how these men will be armed?

77
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,189
It seems they'll be
very well armed, indeed.

78
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,276
Where are we going and
how are we getting back from there?

79
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,397
It'll be in France, and the group
will disband at the RV point.

80
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,995
<i>- What does she mean?</i>
<i>- After that, we're on our own.</i>

81
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,674
<i>- It's a military term.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

82
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,273
Larry, tell Vincent what you'll need.

83
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,070
Something very fast. Audi S-8.
Something that can shove.

84
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,799
I'm going to have it for you
by the afternoon.

85
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,435
I'll also need a nitrous system.
I've got the specs.

86
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,229
What do you use, weapons-wise?

87
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,476
- Hmm?
- Weapons.

88
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,518
- I'm a... I'm a weapons man.
- Weapons man.

89
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,431
- Yeah.
- Okay.

90
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,394
They tend to settle the argument.
So what do you favour?

91
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,956
Well, you know. It's a toolbox.
You put the tools in for the job.

92
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,195
What?

93
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,272
You know,
I actually favour the old 1911.

94
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,636
.45. Old gun.

95
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,436
It served my country well.
A long time.

96
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,835
Your country!

97
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,916
Not done too well, have you,
last few wars?

98
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,349
Perhaps not, but at least
we don't go around whining about it.

99
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,630
You ex-military?

100
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,631
No, I got my job
through the New York Times.

101
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,311
<i>- Don't let him get you down.</i>
- It don't mean nothin' to me.

102
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,152
<i>I say what I think.</i>

103
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,595
Are you ex-military?

104
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,836
Boys at Hereford?

105
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,520
I'm sorry, but I'd like to go backwards.
The line of retreat is...

106
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,957
She just told you.
We meet back at the RV, disband.

107
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,868
I understand. I'm just trying to get
a vague notion of the opposition.

108
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:27,432
We're gonna cause some animosity.
How many will be coming after us?

109
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,472
- You worried about your own skin?
- Yeah, I am.

110
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,391
It covers my body.

111
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,991
All your concerns will be addressed
before we leave.

112
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,509
- Electronics and commo.
- Not more than three cars?

113
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,953
That is our information.

114
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,674
- Can you get me a simulator?
- What's a simulator?

115
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,877
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead.
Sounds like a pistol.

116
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,473
Quite diverting.

117
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,075
Listen, I'm also gonna need
some bigger injection jets.

118
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
The Bosch is not gonna do it.
They have to be custom-made.

119
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,678
We going north? We going south?

120
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,877
I'd like some new clothes.

121
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,520
- Vincent will sort you out.
- I'll take care of it.

122
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,157
- So what brought you here?
- A fella that doesn't work so well.

123
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,715
The man in the wheelchair?

124
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,993
How did he get there?

125
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,710
That was in your neck of the woods,
back in the late unpleasantness.

126
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,874
Good reflexes.

127
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,038
Oh, yeah.

128
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,636
They die hard.

129
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,750
- Interrogation.
- What?

130
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,753
- Methods to withstand interrogation.
- You've done that?

131
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,713
We were taught
to hold out indefinitely.

132
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,035
- Nobody can hold out indefinitely.
- Ah, is that so?

133
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,513
Everybody has a limit. I spent
some time in interrogation... once.

134
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,875
- They make it hard on you?
- They don't make it easy.

135
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,113
Yeah, it was unpleasant.
I held out as long as I could.

136
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,794
All the stuff they tried.

137
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,110
You just can't hold out for ever.

138
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,794
- Impossible.
- How'd they finally get to you?

139
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,559
- They gave me a grasshopper.
- What's a grasshopper?

140
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,992
That's two part gin, two part brandy,
one part creme de menthe...

141
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,076
Fuckin' smartass!

142
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,798
- Can you find this place?
- Of course.

143
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,751
I know it.

144
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,758
That's where
they wanna do the exchange.

145
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,632
You're gonna exchange for cash?

146
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,559
- You know these people?
- My people know them.

147
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,830
Your people have done business
with them before?

148
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,639
Or these people
just gave your people a number?

149
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,155
Larry.

150
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,195
Okay. If we're gonna do it,
let's do the goddamn thing right.

151
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,633
- Hey!
- I'm busy.

152
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,070
Okay, come on. Let's go.

153
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,556
The answers to your questions
I'll know when I get back.

154
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,632
- I'll go with you.
- Go with them.

155
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,877
Who does this girl work for?

156
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,158
Well, she works for our betters.

157
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,312
It seems that's what
we're meant to know.

158
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,638
Always a waiting game.

159
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,395
- What?
- It's a waiting game.

160
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,951
Hey, wait.
Would you not do that, please?

161
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,918
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

162
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,035
There they are.

163
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,954
- You have the list?
- Yes, I have it.

164
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,718
Give it to me.

165
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,314
Money?

166
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,954
Okay. You follow my lead.

167
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,230
Just make sure you watch my back.

168
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,438
<i>Don't make any sudden moves.</i>

169
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,316
<i>Just because we're buying guns</i>
<i>doesn't mean we didn't bring any.</i>

170
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,551
<i>Don't worry. Everything's fine.</i>

171
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,594
You want to back him up?

172
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,436
What would I profit from your death?

173
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,830
- Well, you'd have the money.
- I have the money already.

174
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,035
I'll watch the back.

175
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,518
<i>- Have you got it all?</i>
- Oui.

176
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,511
<i>- You're sure?</i>
<i>- Of course. Come and see.</i>

177
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,355
<i>There it is!</i>

178
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,875
It's not all here.

179
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,870
- Vincent.
- What?

180
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,274
It's not all here.

181
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,112
- C'est tout?
- Ah, non, non, non.

182
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,353
Le patron va contrôler I'argent.
Vous aurez le reste de la marchandise.

183
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,319
Tiens. Il est la dans la voiture,
avec le patron.

184
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,678
He said the rest is in the other car.
The boss wants to check the money.

185
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,832
<i>If he agrees, we have no problem.</i>

186
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,672
<i>Here, take the car keys.</i>

187
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,718
<i>Go on. Take them.</i>

188
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,152
<i>Come on. Come.</i>

189
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,319
Okay, give me...
Give me some of the money.

190
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,078
Give me some of the money!

191
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,155
- Okay.
- You aren't going in there?

192
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,233
- Yeah, I am, and so are you.
- Why am I going in there?

193
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,194
- Why? To protect me.
- There is no protection there.

194
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,636
If it's a come-on, we're fish in a barrel.
Why do they want you in there?

195
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,029
- What are you, crazy?
- You know, you think too hard.

196
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,630
Nobody ever told me that before.
But I wouldn't go in there.

197
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,636
- What is it, Sam?
- I don't like it. Look at it.

198
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,037
Okay, okay.

199
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,469
Okay, let's just do it.
Let's just do it and be done, yeah?

200
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,753
You don't wanna go in there.

201
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,028
- I'm getting paid to go. It's that simple.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

202
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,590
If anything goes down,
get next to one of those guys.

203
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,750
If there's a sniper,
he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

204
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,472
- Let's go!
- All right.

205
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,551
Stop!

206
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,756
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

207
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,474
<i>So, everything's fine.</i>

208
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,916
Shit! I can't see! I can't see!

209
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,231
Have some of this!

210
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,193
Fuckin' arsehole!

211
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,637
Fuckin' have some more, you bastards!

212
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,111
Come on! Come on!

213
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,789
Let's go!

214
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,993
- No! You goddamn...
- Come on! Let's go!

215
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,357
- Is anybody hurt?
- We're fine.

216
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,836
Almost a bit of raspberry jam
back there, yeah?

217
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,751
A bit of raspberry jam back there!

218
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,869
Got the swag, kept the money.
Job well done.

219
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,791
That's a fact. That is a fact.

220
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,309
Slow down. Slow down.

221
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,390
I think I have to stop.

222
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,950
Thank you.

223
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,877
Why did you take this job?

224
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,276
My friend, I need the money.

225
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,635
<i>The money is here.</i>

226
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,797
That's what this is, you know? Money.

227
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,551
Yeah, but who are our employers?

228
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,877
You're right.

229
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,997
Excuse me.

230
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,554
Excuse me, monsieur.

231
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,275
The Russians are bidding for the case.

232
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,239
The case is in Nice.
They're trying to sell it to the Russians.

233
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,471
They're staying at
the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

234
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,872
- The team isn't ready.
- Whatever the team is, you do it now.

235
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,952
The Russians have decided to bid.
We need to move now.

236
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,036
Excuse me.

237
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,516
I have the information.
We'll be movin' very soon.

238
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,471
It'll definitely
be in the nature of an ambush

239
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,275
somewhere between here and here.

240
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,632
We'll anticipate
a three-car convoy with a backup team.

241
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,110
We will try and stop the target
before they can get away from us.

242
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,117
- What's in the case?
- That information isn't necessary.

243
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,151
Is it heavy? Is it explosive?

244
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,191
Is it chained
to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

245
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,276
- Are we gonna have to chop it off?
- All right.

246
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,476
I don't have to let you know...

247
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,797
Then the price has got to go up.

248
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,672
I'll get you the case,
but the price has gotta go up.

249
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,439
If it's gonna be amateur night,
I want $100,000. I want it up front.

250
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,071
I want it in a bank account. I want
another $100,000 when you get the case.

251
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,838
Okay.

252
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,033
We've got shooters here, shooters here.

253
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,917
I'll tell you an old trick.

254
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,677
Hey.

255
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,560
- What's your problem?
- Draw it again.

256
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,037
Draw it again.
You're the ace field man. Draw it again.

257
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,675
It's a simple diagram.
Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

258
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,151
Draw it again! Draw it again.

259
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,510
Two shooters.
Car comes through here.

260
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,511
Shooters across from each other,
kill each other dead.

261
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,359
- Oh, my. Where'd you learn that?
- In a regiment.

262
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,869
- What regiment was that?
- The 22nd Special Air Service.

263
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,269
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

264
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,874
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

265
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,837
- I don't like your attitude.
- What's the colour of the boathouse...

266
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,349
- Fuck off!
- What's... You got the gun. I'm unarmed.

267
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,318
Do something. Go ahead.
Do something. Do something.

268
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,271
Do something.

269
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,394
Tell me about an ambush?
Don't tell me about an ambush!

270
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,392
I ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

271
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,275
You'll get your money
when we get the case.

272
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,033
- The others, too.
- That is what I understood.

273
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,917
Come on.
We've gotten the word. We're movin'.

274
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,831
Put this near the front.

275
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,517
Careful! Careful with that!

276
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,750
So what colour
is the boathouse at Hereford?

277
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,711
How the fuck should I know?

278
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,031
This'll complete your compensation.

279
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,238
Thanks for your time.
Feel free to leave when we're gone.

280
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,637
Do I need to suggest that you forget us?

281
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,795
Because we will not forget.

282
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,316
- Morning.
- I see you're reviewin' our problem.

283
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,914
Well, either you're part of the problem,
part of the solution,

284
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,116
- or you're just part of the landscape.
- Indeed.

285
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,634
What's in the case?

286
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,955
Something we're paying ya for.

287
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:32,353
- You and the girl are in front of the hotel.
- The name's Deirdre.

288
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,358
Deirdre.
Wait outside the hotel for the target.

289
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,795
He leaves the hotel for the villa,
the villa for the hotel.

290
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,035
He activates his cellphone.

291
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,872
How do you know
he's gonna use his cellphone?

292
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,753
- He'll use a phone.
- How do you know?

293
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,155
- I'm gonna call him on it.
- How do you know he'll have it with him?

294
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,396
He's waitin' for a call.

295
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,593
His people will call him to tell him
the location of the meet.

296
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,517
- Okay?
- Okay.

297
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,797
The villa, the hotel, the car,
the stop light, 8 to 10 guys.

298
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,717
How good's their...
How good's their security?

299
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,758
- I can't tell you.
- Well, let's find out. Where are they?

300
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,671
The last report, they were at the hotel.

301
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,597
- The case is at the hotel?
- We presume that it is.

302
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,359
- That's interesting.
- Why don't we do it now?

303
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,671
- It's tempting.
- It's a good plan. Let's stick to the plan.

304
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,349
Everybody wants to go to the party.
Nobody wants to stay and clean up.

305
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,715
- Please.
- The only thing is that the map...

306
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,394
The map is not the territory.

307
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,233
Let's go look at the ground.

308
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,198
Bring some money.
We're gonna do a little shopping.

309
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,918
Listen up.

310
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,798
You're my wife.
Be who you wanna look like.

311
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,917
It's just a game. Just a game.

312
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,719
Man and a woman going for a walk.

313
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,315
Piece of cake.
Relax. Relax, darling.

314
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,751
You look good cleaned up.

315
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,431
Is that the hotel?

316
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,159
Put your arm under mine.
Put your arm under mine.

317
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,077
Why aren't they at the villa?
Why are they down here?

318
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,236
Fun and games?
Pretty girls and beer or what?

319
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,751
<i>Can I help you, sir?</i>

320
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,996
<i>No. We're looking at the menu.</i>

321
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,513
Merci.

322
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,789
Uh, excuse me?
Do you speak English?

323
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,357
A little.

324
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,079
Could you take a picture
of me and my wife?

325
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,794
It's very easy. You press like that.

326
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,151
- Sure.
- Like that. That's it. Focus like that.

327
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,077
Okay?

328
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,317
We're gonna do it over here.

329
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,869
Can you get that palm tree in?
We wanna show we're on the Riviera.

330
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,677
- How many do you want?
- Just snap away.

331
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,876
Very good. Again.

332
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,117
Again. Get the background.

333
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,359
Take a couple of my wife, alone.

334
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,470
<i>Take my luggage up right away.</i>

335
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,871
Thank you.

336
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,075
Can we take one picture of you
with my wife? One picture with you?

337
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,996
That's it.

338
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,795
So?

339
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,036
Well, they're good.

340
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,469
Guy goes for the case,
other guy's protecting the principal.

341
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,397
Nobody panics. They're good.

342
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,796
- So what have we learned?
- Can it be done?

343
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,348
It can be done.
We should have two more men.

344
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,113
- We don't have two more men.
- Go to your handler.

345
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,997
- There is no handler.
- Let me go.

346
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,190
There's no handler.
There's only me.

347
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,238
Listen, you want the case,
we're gonna need some more men.

348
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,397
There's no more help,
there's no more men. Are you afraid?

349
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,795
Of course I'm afraid. You think
I'm reluctant because I'm happy?

350
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,031
We've made a good plan,
and we're gonna stick with it.

351
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,677
What do we do?

352
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,073
We wait.

353
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,511
<i>- So, who are they?</i>
<i>- Our employers.</i>

354
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,636
- Qui est la?
- It's me.

355
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,109
They've gone back to the villa.

356
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,356
- Did they have the case with them?
- They did.

357
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,232
- Did you get the other cars?
- Got 'em.

358
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,033
- And how do they run?
- They'll do fine.

359
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,477
Yeah.

360
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,997
Well, what does that mean?

361
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,470
It would be nice to do something.

362
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,955
We are doing something.
We're sitting here, waiting.

363
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,956
It's not gonna happen today.

364
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,355
The buyers are out of town.

365
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,710
Tomorrow at the earliest.

366
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,796
You know what?
The hell with 'em. Let's go put 'em to bed.

367
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,554
- We've got the report.
- If I take the report, I got nothing else.

368
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,399
I can go see for myself.
They at the villa?

369
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,751
I'm gonna go take one last run
over the route and tuck 'em in.

370
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,751
I'll come with ya.

371
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,349
So how did you get started
in this business?

372
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,070
A wealthy scoundrel
seduced and betrayed me.

373
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,635
Same with me. How 'bout that?

374
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,152
Take out the map. Take out the map.
If anybody looks, we're...

375
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,755
So who are those guys inside?

376
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,474
You tell me.

377
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,917
Ex-military, Northern Sov Block,
somebody or other.

378
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,113
- They need a job. That's my excuse.
- Is it?

379
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,871
Cops.

380
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,640
System activated.

381
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,920
System check.

382
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,396
Repeat system check.

383
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,272
There he is. He's being good.
He's activated his phone.

384
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,551
I'm in position.

385
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,989
- They're passin' me now.
- Target is on the way.

386
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,918
Hell of a time to be workin'.

387
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,831
What do you want for Christmas?

388
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,520
My two front teeth.

389
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,710
May your wish be granted.

390
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,030
Target is 400 metres
from the traffic light.

391
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,433
Come on! Come on!

392
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,875
So far so good.
Target on the right road.

393
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,672
Sam, escort car.

394
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,553
- Four tenths of a click in front of you.
- Got it.

395
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,869
Larry, you should see them in...
four seconds.

396
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,638
Two cars.

397
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,955
I got 'em.

398
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,958
Target has escaped.
I repeat, target has gotten away.

399
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,073
Target heading for Vieux Nice.

400
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,235
Through the market, then straight.

401
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,197
Right at the fork, Maréchal Foch.

402
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,590
Okay, you're in front of him.

403
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,475
- Cut him off at the end of the port.
- Roger that. I got it.

404
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,193
He's coming from the right.

405
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,235
He's yours.

406
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,994
- I'm hit! Take the case!
- Up the other end!

407
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,913
- Get the fucking case!
- Get the car up the other end!

408
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,916
Take this!

409
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,634
Get out of here!
I'll see you at the safe house!

410
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,236
Hey! Get rid of the case!
Get rid of the case!

411
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,152
Arretez-vous!

412
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,959
- Where is Gregor?
- Gregor fucked us.

413
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,391
- How is it out there?
- A lot of heat. A lot of heat.

414
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,436
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

415
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,313
- Thanks for before.
- Don't mention it.

416
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,071
Could you clean the paint off this?

417
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,158
- You got a pack of Camels in there?
- No, you smoke too much.

418
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,271
<i>We must get out of here.</i>

419
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,914
I'm gonna need your people to help us.

420
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,838
- And I need you to find the case.
- All right, call your guy.

421
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:15,269
When we bring in the case, he'll help you.

422
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,153
- How can I bring him the case?
- Well, Gregor has it.

423
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,313
- Why?
- I presume to sell it to the Russians.

424
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,789
Why the Russians? Why not you?

425
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,029
If we had the money to buy the case,

426
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,680
we wouldn't have
hired you to steal it, would we?

427
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,394
- Go to your people. Talk to them.
- You want the case?

428
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,311
We find Gregor, we find the case.

429
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,352
- How do we find Gregor?
- How'd you find him in the first place?

430
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,590
I found him
through your friend, the cripple,

431
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,830
who gave me nothin'
but a bunch of fucking lames!

432
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,072
You and Spence
and the whole sorry lot of you!

433
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,997
We can find him through his cellphone.

434
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,751
Can we trace his cellphone?

435
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,832
They can triangulate it,
if we had that equipment.

436
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,433
Who has that equipment?

437
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,276
Who has that equipment?

438
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,477
Tell me.

439
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,397
Who has it?

440
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,278
All right. All right.

441
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,470
Give me the number to his phone.

442
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,398
So, how does the day find you?

443
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,268
How do they say it in French?
En pleine forme.

444
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,789
This was supposed to be
a social occasion.

445
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:23,350
- Life is uncertain.
- It is indeed.

446
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,358
But, Gregor,
we have so much history together,

447
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,869
I was sure you wouldn't mind.

448
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,436
- Besides, the world these days is so...
- Unsafe?

449
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,669
Exactly.

450
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,395
I'll show you how unsafe it is.

451
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,993
See that little girl down there?

452
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,156
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you do that?

453
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,430
To make a point.

454
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,112
I don't know her,
but I was ready to blow her brains out.

455
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,352
But you,
I don't particularly like you.

456
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,155
Just imagine what I'll do to you if you
try anything. Now give me my money.

457
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,438
Put down the gun.

458
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,314
- I never liked you either, Gregor.
- Where did that come from?

459
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,991
I should have made you strip.

460
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,720
- Now where's my package?
- It's right behind you.

461
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,919
Whoo-hoo!

462
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,639
<i>Clever girl.</i>

463
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,914
<i>You liked it?</i>

464
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,195
<i>My little sun.</i>

465
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,399
<i>You make me so happy.</i>

466
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,753
<i>Is it done?</i>

467
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,117
It's done, Mikhi.

468
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,869
Natacha?

469
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,428
Gregor? Is that you, Gregor?

470
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,397
Much to your disappointment,
no doubt.

471
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,189
It was a mistake.
It should not have happened.

472
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,317
Well, if it happens again,
I'll turn around and sell it to the Irish.

473
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,551
- Don't do that.
- Then don't make me.

474
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,432
My price just went up 300%.

475
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,159
I want the package, Gregor.
What do I have to do to get it?

476
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,111
Just wait for my next phone call.

477
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,589
I'll find a place
where I can tilt the field in my favour.

478
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,679
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

479
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,916
Could you tell me
how to find a post office?

480
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:15,157
Do... Do I know you?
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

481
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,475
How did you know I speak English?

482
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,869
You got an English newspaper.

483
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,831
Sorry.

484
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,876
- I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
- It's all right.

485
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,428
Uh, what do you need
a post office for?

486
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,239
'Cause over here,
they use them for different things.

487
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,196
I need your help.

488
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,597
- I thought you left.
- I did leave.

489
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,836
- You did leave? You're out?
- That's right.

490
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,195
Can you help me? I need your help.

491
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,917
What's the number?

492
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,873
Yeah, the post office is, uh,
just down to your left.

493
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,672
- Up on the left? Thanks.
- On the left.

494
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,995
- A friend of yours?
- We went to high school together.

495
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,271
Everyone's your brother
until the rent comes due.

496
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,873
Ain't that the truth!

497
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,355
<i>Yes. Yes, on the terrace?</i>

498
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,159
<i>Facing me? I see him.</i>

499
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,198
<i>Yes, I'll get him. Hang on, please.</i>

500
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,913
<i>Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam?</i>

501
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,590
Yeah.

502
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,079
<i>Telephone for you.</i>

503
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,431
Yeah, good to see you, too.

504
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,273
If his position changes, I'll let you know.

505
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,636
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

506
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,909
He's at the arena.

507
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,878
So this is the amphitheatre of Arles

508
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,834
which was built
at the end of the first century AD.

509
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,269
It is built with limestone.

510
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,668
I know those men.

511
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,552
And you can see
this dominant yellow colour

512
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:27,074
which is actually caused
essentially by a lantern.

513
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,799
We're not sure that the walls
were actually yellow.

514
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,711
And so, now we will continue

515
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,354
and visit the Roman baths
down this way.

516
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,237
Yeah.

517
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:55,394
Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll do nicely.

518
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,037
It's Sergi. I remember you.

519
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,799
Yes, Gregor, it's me.

520
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,509
- How have you been?
- Well. These are trying times.

521
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,598
- I'm sorry about the unfortunate incident.
- Oh, yeah.

522
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,036
It was excessive.
And more to the point, it was foolish.

523
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,759
I couldn't agree with you more.

524
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,070
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

525
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,239
Yeah, he's turned rogue
and can't be controlled, is that it?

526
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,319
Excusez-moi.
Je cherche la vieille maison de Van Gogh.

527
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,398
- I don't... I don't...
- Oh, English.

528
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,311
Sorry. Such a fool.

529
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,237
I was looking for Van Gogh's old house.

530
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,552
So what could have been conducted
in a collegial atmosphere

531
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,671
is now fucked into a cocked hat.

532
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,548
- What do you think?
- I think we'll meet your price.

533
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,119
Yeah. Yes, so let's see it. Let's see it now.

534
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,553
Where do you have it, in your belt?

535
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,234
- Let's see it!
- Show me the case first.

536
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,477
You're great in the locker room,
and your reflexes might die hard,

537
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,397
but you're weak
when you put your spikes on.

538
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,754
- Gregor? Are you all right?
- Gregor's fine.

539
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:18,440
But I think you're in a wee spot of trouble.

540
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:22,193
- Where is it? Where is it?
- I don't have it with me.

541
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,235
Where?

542
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,709
I mailed it to myself.
A post-office box in Paris.

543
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:26,789
Hilfe!

544
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,518
Help! He's robbing me!

545
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,036
Pardon. Pardon.

546
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,878
Pardon. Avancez!

547
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,796
Pardon.

548
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:13,436
Stop.

549
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,634
- Where do I know you from?
- Vienna.

550
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,190
Of course. I'm sorry to have to do this.

551
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:24,269
Hey!

552
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,512
- Christ.
- Drive.

553
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,675
Stop! Descends! Vite! Descends!

554
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:33,111
- I'm gonna have to take care of this.
- What do you want to do?

555
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,829
Uh, get to a doctor
or a veterinarian's office.

556
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,110
I'll just boost what I need.

557
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,235
- Could you do that?
- Of course. I can do better.

558
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:50,990
- How is it?
- I'm leakin'.

559
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:53,958
I'm sorry.

560
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,237
That girl sold us out.

561
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,433
She sold us out.

562
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,753
<i>- Ready, Jean-Pierre?</i>
<i>- Everything's ready.</i>

563
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,191
Get my legs up.

564
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:22,111
Careful.

565
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,396
Are you sure you can do this?

566
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,956
Yeah. I once removed a guy's appendix
with a grapefruit spoon.

567
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,197
- Have a drink.
- No booze. No.

568
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:50,470
Easy, easy, easy.

569
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:59,915
It's just below the surface.

570
01:09:01,360 --> 01:09:04,397
All right, let's do it.
Just douse it with alcohol.

571
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:10,109
Take the gauze and wipe away
as much of the blood as you can.

572
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,310
Keep it clean so I can see it.

573
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,391
Yeah. That's it.

574
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,996
All right.
What we're gonna do is routine.

575
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,554
I've done this many times before.

576
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,750
There are no vital organs, arteries.
It's okay.

577
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,871
You won't kill me.
Just make sure you get the bullet

578
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,951
- before you pry it out.
- All right.

579
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,877
Take that scalpel.

580
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,031
The upper part.

581
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,471
Over here. Just cut up there.

582
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,391
Just a little cut.

583
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,677
Okay. Got it.

584
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:05,277
Now take the clamp.

585
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,994
Take the clamp and open up... the hole.

586
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:10,588
Just put it in there.

587
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,471
Put it in there.

588
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,391
That's it. Put it in. Just...

589
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:17,670
Now open it up. Spread it. Spread it.

590
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,035
Okay. Okay.

591
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,078
Now get the other...
Get the other clamps and get the bullet.

592
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,116
Remember, don't take it out
unless you really got it.

593
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,031
Do it again. Do it again.
Just try once more.

594
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,430
I'm sorry.

595
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,989
When he pulls it out, put the gauze in.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

596
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,277
Put the gauze there.

597
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,115
Fucker sprayed his bullet with Teflon.

598
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:25,069
He was trying to stamp me "paid in full".

599
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:27,913
- Is that why it went through the vest?
- Yeah.

600
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,239
You think you can stitch me up
on your own?

601
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:37,030
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna pass out.

602
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,035
You gonna kill me?

603
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,874
No. I'm not gonna kill ya.

604
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,117
Why would I want to kill ya?

605
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:20,393
- I gave you a job.
- I did my job.

606
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,112
So how'd it go wrong?

607
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,156
I thought you wanted the case.

608
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,038
Oh, we'll get the case.

609
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,078
We'll get the case, eh, Gregor?

610
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:34,551
Don't you worry about the case.

611
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,956
What I want's an explanation.

612
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,674
An explanation? For what?

613
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,717
You bollixed it up.

614
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:46,713
- I bollixed it up?
- You hired him.

615
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,631
Through your fucking contact!

616
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,995
- You didn't do your homework.
- Why did you have to kill Larry?

617
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,911
Oh, Larry, is it?

618
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,797
I was clearing up your mess.

619
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,678
My mess?
Oh, well, you take over, then.

620
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,597
- Eh?
- But you can't, can you?

621
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,790
It's you that's hiding, isn't it, Seamus?

622
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,195
It's you that can't show your face.

623
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:18,070
Who else thinks that?
Who you been talking to?

624
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,316
Isn't that the reason
why I'm doing this job?

625
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,597
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

626
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:28,751
Do your job, eh?

627
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,956
<i>He's tough, your Yank.</i>

628
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,838
<i>You're right about that.</i>

629
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,194
<i>But who is he?</i>

630
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,592
<i>That's not important.</i>

631
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,199
<i>Didn't he work for the CIA?</i>

632
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,998
<i>He used to.</i>

633
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,113
<i>Not anymore?</i>

634
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,232
<i>He's on the run.</i>

635
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,113
<i>You're sure?</i>

636
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:12,955
<i>I know what he can do.</i>
<i>I've seen him.</i>

637
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,429
<i>Why would he carve himself up</i>
<i>if he were still CIA?</i>

638
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,034
<i>He makes a call and it's taken care of.</i>

639
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,071
<i>And you? How are you?</i>

640
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:43,759
<i>We need some information.</i>
<i>We need to find some people in Paris.</i>

641
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,795
<i>Who?</i>

642
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,874
<i>An Irish man and woman,</i>

643
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,110
<i>a German, an ex-KGB.</i>

644
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,949
<i>They're professionals.</i>

645
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,473
<i>They're in hiding.</i>

646
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,078
<i>This is really important to you?</i>

647
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,634
<i>He saved my life.</i>

648
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,230
Bon.

649
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,028
<i>I'll find them for you.</i>

650
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,673
Where's the case?

651
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,837
It will come tomorrow. I'm sure.

652
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,390
Well, I'm sure it will, too. Let's go.

653
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:42,670
Let's hope so, for your sake, anyway.

654
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,110
Are you feeling better?

655
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,356
Yeah, enough to move around. Thanks.

656
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,677
My hobby.

657
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,557
One grows old.

658
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,037
I knew a lot of fellas, friends of mine,

659
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,957
they just wanted to live to open a bar.

660
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,395
Had they lived,
would they have done it?

661
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:45,477
- Then they were spared their disillusion.
- Yeah, that's right.

662
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,510
Who were these people?
Friends of yours?

663
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,198
- I wouldn't hurt a friend.
- Was that my question?

664
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:57,914
That's right.

665
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:06,431
Well, who are you?

666
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,356
A fella like you,
trying to make it to retirement.

667
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,393
At the end of the day, we're likely
to be punished for our kindnesses.

668
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,392
You don't have to worry about me.
I won't hurt you.

669
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:47,355
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

670
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:54,559
47 samurai whose master
was betrayed and killed by another lord.

671
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,030
They became ronin, masterless samurai,

672
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,276
disgraced by another man's treachery.

673
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,148
For three years they plotted,
pretending to be thieves,

674
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:06,874
mercenaries, even madmen.

675
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,275
That I didn't have time to do.

676
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,669
And then one night they struck,
slipping into the castle

677
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,677
of their lord's betrayer, killing him.

678
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,435
Nice. I like that. My kind of job.

679
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,437
There's something more.

680
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,919
All 47 of them committed seppuku,

681
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,237
ritual suicide,
in the courtyard of the castle.

682
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:31,033
Well, that I don't like so much.

683
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:34,152
- But you understand it?
- What do you mean, I understand it?

684
01:19:36,120 --> 01:19:40,591
The warrior code, the delight in the battle.
You understand that, yes?

685
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,598
But also something more.

686
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,989
You understand there is something
outside yourself

687
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,355
that has to be served.

688
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,630
And when that need is gone,

689
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,036
when belief has died, what are you?

690
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,031
A man without a master.

691
01:19:57,200 --> 01:19:59,919
Right now I'm a man
without a pay cheque.

692
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:03,635
The ronin could have hired
themselves to new masters.

693
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,790
They could have fought
for themselves.

694
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:08,798
But they chose honour.
They chose myth.

695
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,672
They chose wrong.

696
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:21,594
Seppu... Seppu... what?

697
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:23,836
Yes, seppuku.

698
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:26,070
Disembowelment.

699
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:28,839
The sword goes in here.

700
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,476
Are you sure this address is good?

701
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,431
Jean-Pierre gave it to me.

702
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:17,876
Under the bridge by the river...

703
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,520
How did you know
it was an ambush?

704
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,995
Whenever there is any doubt,
there is no doubt.

705
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,917
That's the first thing they teach you.

706
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,114
Who taught you?

707
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:34,277
I don't remember.
That's the second thing they teach you.

708
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,435
All good things
come to those who wait.

709
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:14,430
- Why is Gregor still alive?
- He's taking them to the package.

710
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,149
How ya doin'?

711
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:49,319
What are you...
What are you gonna do to me?

712
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:54,468
Let's just be calm for one more moment.
One more moment.

713
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,631
Why? Why?

714
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,711
You know why.

715
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,870
No. You don't wanna do that.

716
01:23:16,520 --> 01:23:17,475
You can't.

717
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:22,837
Get back!

718
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,271
Get in the fucking car!

719
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,313
Why didn't you shoot her?

720
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,032
Take the tunnel, now!

721
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,031
Oh, Christ!

722
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:35,276
Eh, merde!

723
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:37,359
Come on! Come on!

724
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,317
All right, you fuck!

725
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:24,115
Where could he be?

726
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,988
- Where could he be?
- Hmm.

727
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:31,430
The Irish and the Russians are looking
for him. So where does he go?

728
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,229
He goes to the Russians
to make the deal for the case.

729
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:38,676
Gregor ain't comin' in unless
he can figure out a safe exchange.

730
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:40,870
He knows they'll kill him for the case
rather than pay him for it.

731
01:31:40,960 --> 01:31:46,114
He's got to work it out soon
before the Irish find him.

732
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,152
So where does he go?

733
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:52,717
You go to what you know.

734
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:59,795
He's KGB.
He goes to one of his old safe houses.

735
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,714
No, they're all blown.

736
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:06,115
Where does he go?

737
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:14,916
So, you're on the run.
Where do you go?

738
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:16,871
Hmm?

739
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:25,072
Where's he been? Where's he been?
Where's he been? Where's he been?

740
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,828
He made the fake case.

741
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,195
He had the fake case made.

742
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,630
Gregor. He had it made.

743
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:47,188
He had to have had it made.

744
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,632
In Paris, before we went to Nice.

745
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:53,472
He didn't have time to have it made.

746
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:55,676
He bought something that looked like it,
then spray-painted it.

747
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,228
Where did he get the spray?
He never left the room.

748
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:00,231
Where did he get the case?

749
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,630
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

750
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:33,832
It's a case for ice skates.

751
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,111
Why ice skates?

752
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,231
And why would Gregor
know an ice-skate case?

753
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,549
He didn't have time to have it made.

754
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:52,276
He didn't have time to have it made.
The Russians made it.

755
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,628
The Russians made it.

756
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:01,437
We're following the wrong people.

757
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,358
We don't have to find Gregor.

758
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,074
We find the Russians,
they will take us to him.

759
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,909
<i>You've lived in Paris</i>
<i>a long time. You know the people.</i>

760
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,912
<i>- I get around.</i>
<i>- You meet the new Russians.</i>

761
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,754
<i>You know how it is.</i>
<i>Ex-spies. Now it's Mafia.</i>

762
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,636
<i>Under diplomatic cover.</i>

763
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,075
<i>KGB?</i>

764
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,275
<i>Ex-KGB.</i>

765
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:29,071
<i>Heavy hitters, gamblers,</i>
<i>lots of money, big cars.</i>

766
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,513
<i>They live like tsars.</i>
<i>Throw money away.</i>

767
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,397
<i>Fur hats are expensive.</i>

768
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:37,679
<i>- And bodyguards.</i>
<i>- Expensive coats, Dr Zhivago.</i>

769
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,797
<i>I have a lot of work, no time.</i>

770
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:43,798
<i>I understand.</i>

771
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:47,118
<i>All right. Let's go.</i>

772
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,955
Okay.

773
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,353
<i>It will be fine.</i>

774
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,597
The guy is gonna reach out.

775
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:02,511
Is he any good?

776
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:05,393
Jean-Pierre says if it's Russian
and it's in Paris...

777
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:19,316
<i>If I wanted to find Russians</i>
<i>in Paris this week,</i>

778
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,393
<i>I'd go to the ice show.</i>

779
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,436
- Bonsoir, Pierre.
- Bonsoir.

780
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,351
Je vais payer pour votre sour.

781
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,671
Oh, merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Kirilova.

782
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,471
<i>I'll trade you a cigarette for a favour.</i>

783
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,831
<i>The favour is, steer clear of those guys.</i>

784
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,353
<i>Who? The Russians?</i>

785
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:04,716
<i>They sure throw their money around.</i>

786
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,835
Bonsoir.

787
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:09,036
- Ça va?
- Salut.

788
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:13,997
- Bonsoir.
- Ah, bonsoir.

789
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:24,432
The Russian is seeing Natacha Kirilova,
the star of the ice show.

790
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,956
He spends every evening in the audience.

791
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,593
How did you find that out?

792
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:33,831
We went to high school together.

793
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:09,035
<i>Mikhi, is everything all right?</i>

794
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,153
<i>Everything is fine.</i>

795
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,309
<i>Sweet girl.</i>

796
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:16,955
<i>Go. Go on.</i>

797
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,832
<i>Ladies and gentlemen!</i>

798
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:40,071
<i>We are very proud to present...</i>

799
01:38:40,160 --> 01:38:46,759
<i>... two-time Olympic champion</i>
<i>and three-time World champion...</i>

800
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,310
<i>... Natacha Kirilova!</i>

801
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:53,271
Let's go.

802
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:08,116
<i>Wait out here.</i>

803
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,030
Yes, he is.

804
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,111
Hello, Mikhi.

805
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:21,074
- The meeting is not till later tonight.
- The meeting's now.

806
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,833
You have the money?

807
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,874
Well, we were going to go back
to get it before the meet.

808
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,029
I don't think so.

809
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,271
You have the money?

810
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,398
I might have the money.
Where is the case?

811
01:41:42,480 --> 01:41:46,678
No, you have to do it.
I couldn't live with myself.

812
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,917
I have the money.

813
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,429
We conclude this now
and part friends.

814
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,238
Okay?

815
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,035
Where is the case?

816
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:22,717
I'd like to be paid now.

817
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:30,150
No doubt.

818
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:36,517
Now tell me the other part.

819
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:39,990
The other part?

820
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,917
I'm leaving.

821
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,793
I'm taking my fee and I'm leaving.

822
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:49,318
I have a person with a rifle in the stadium.

823
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:52,239
I've worked with her for years.
She never misses.

824
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:55,193
I will call.

825
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:57,550
I have to call within 45 seconds

826
01:42:57,680 --> 01:42:59,671
to say that I'm leaving,

827
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,837
and then in another 10 minutes
to say that I'm safe.

828
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:08,194
Should I be unable to call,
your friend will be shot.

829
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,437
30 seconds, Mikhi.

830
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,189
<i>- We need to get inside.</i>
<i>- You can't pass without badges.</i>

831
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:31,992
20 seconds.

832
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:43,195
10 seconds.

833
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:13,993
<i>There were two of them.</i>

834
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,718
<i>They were looking for those guys.</i>

835
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:17,870
<i>Just a minute, sir!</i>

836
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,514
<i>I am a Chilean citizen,</i>
<i>as you can see from my passport.</i>

837
01:44:37,600 --> 01:44:39,192
Merci.

838
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:19,117
- Mama!
- Shh, shh, shh.

839
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,278
Katchev!

840
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:27,475
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

841
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:42,835
Stay with him.

842
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,794
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

843
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:19,639
Get out of the car.
Walk away. Walk away!

844
01:46:19,720 --> 01:46:22,439
Walk away! Go. Go.

845
01:46:22,520 --> 01:46:25,273
- I will if you will.
- Just go.

846
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,715
Come with me.
Forget about the case.

847
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,349
I didn't come for the case.
I came for your boss.

848
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:38,588
I came for Seamus. I came for him.

849
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,630
Just get out of here.
I never left. Don't you see?

850
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,190
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

851
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:57,474
Get out of the way!

852
01:46:57,560 --> 01:46:58,834
<i>This way is blocked.</i>

853
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,317
I can take you in or leave you here.

854
01:47:28,760 --> 01:47:29,954
There. That's him with the case.

855
01:47:30,040 --> 01:47:32,076
<i>Sir! Over here, please.</i>

856
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:32,876
<i>Wait! Wait!</i>

857
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,112
<i>There are more back there!</i>

858
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,677
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

859
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,469
Don't move! Shut your fuckin' mouth up!
Shut your mouth!

860
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:39,672
You stupid shite.

861
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,230
You're a dead man.

862
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:07,115
<i>This is the BBC World Service.</i>

863
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:09,800
<i>It was announced today,</i>
<i>after almost 30 years</i>

864
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,151
<i>of bloody and seemingly intractable</i>
<i>civil conflict in Northern Ireland,</i>

865
01:49:13,240 --> 01:49:15,071
<i>that a peace agreement</i>
<i>has been reached between</i>

866
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:18,272
<i>the predominantly Protestant</i>
<i>government of that British-ruled enclave,</i>

867
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:20,834
<i>and the Irish resistance...</i>

868
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:28,876
<i>... have told CNN that it was</i>
<i>the apprehension and slaying</i>

869
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:33,630
<i>in France of the Irish terrorist Seamus</i>
<i>O'Rourke, by parties still unknown,</i>

870
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,950
<i>that contributed a stability,</i>
<i>largely allowing</i>

871
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:39,874
<i>the negotiations to proceed</i>
<i>to their historic conclusion today.</i>

872
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,798
<i>O'Rourke had earlier</i>
<i>been denounced by the IRA,</i>

873
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:46,833
<i>the military wing of Sinn Fein,</i>
<i>as a rogue breakaway operative.</i>

874
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,437
Well, then, good knowin' ya.

875
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:03,675
Hmm?

876
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:06,832
- I'm sorry?
- You said something.

877
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:10,276
I said she would not
be coming back here.

878
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:16,638
Yeah. She would
not be coming back here, would she?

879
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,631
I can't even put my hand in my pocket
to pay the bill.

880
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:26,790
I'll get it.

881
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,952
I'll get the next one.

882
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,712
What was in the case?

883
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:40,876
I don't remember.

884
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,639
Lesson number two.

885
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,517
Keep in touch.

886
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,032
Let's go.

887
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:22,393
No questions, no answers.

888
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,516
That's the business we're in.

889
01:51:24,600 --> 01:51:26,795
You accept it and move on.

890
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:30,833
Maybe that's lesson number three.
