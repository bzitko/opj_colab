00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
Merry Christmas!

3
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,920
- What's your name, little boy?
- Eric.

4
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,600
What do you want for Christmas, Eric? Hm?

5
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,520
A Johnny Lightning 500.

6
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,520
- You been good, little boy?
- Yeah.

7
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,280
Good. You like Santa Claus? Huh?

8
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Now, you like Santa Claus, right?

9
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,640
Let's sing a little song. "Jingle Bells".

10
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,800
Get up.

11
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,880
Get up! And hold 'em up.

12
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
- Hold it!
- Freeze!

13
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,600
Jimmy, watch it. He's got a knife.

14
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,040
- Hold it, you son of a bitch!
- No, no!

15
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,440
That's enough. Don't kill him. That's enough!

16
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,600
- Get up!
- Come on, give me a break!

17
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,280
- I ain't done nothin', man.
- Break, your ass.

18
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,400
- Come on.
- Get up!

19
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
Will you stop it? Stop it!

20
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,360
- Jimmy.
- Let me bust him. I wanna bust him.

21
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,760
- I wanna bust him.
- Let me talk to him. Let me talk to him!

22
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,880
- You got a friend here. You got a friend.
- You gonna tell us who your man is?

23
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,160
When's the last time you picked your feet?
Who's your connection, Willie?

24
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,680
- Answer him!
- No, no, man!

25
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,040
Is it Joe the barber?
That's who it is, isn't it?

26
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,480
Don't give us any shit.
What's Joe's last name?

27
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,680
- I don't know, man!
- Give him a chance. Just give him a chance.

28
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,600
All I know is he lives on 125th Street, man.
Above the barber shop.

29
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,640
What side of the street does he live on?
North or south?

30
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,560
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What side of the street does he live on?

31
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,160
- When's the last time you picked your feet?
- What's he talkin' about?

32
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,000
I got a man in Poughkeepsie wants to talk
to you. You ever been in Poughkeepsie?

33
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,400
- Hey, man, give me a break.
- Come on, say it. Let me hear you say it.

34
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,760
Have you ever been to Poughkeepsie? You've
been to Poughkeepsie? I wanna hear it!

35
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,480
- Yes, I've been to Poughkeepsie.
- You sat on the edge of the bed.

36
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,840
You took off your shoes
and picked your feet, didn't you?

37
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,160
- Now say it!
- Yes.

38
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,400
All right. You put a shiv in my partner.
You know what that means, goddamnit?

39
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,440
All winter I gotta listen to him
gripe about his bowling scores.

40
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm gonna bust your ass for those three bags,
then I'm gonna nail you for picking your feet.

41
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,480
{y:i}Merci.

42
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360
{y:i}Bonjour.

43
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,800
{y:i}C'est merveilleux, chéri.

44
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,960
{y:i}Tu me gâtes. Je t'aime.

45
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,360
{y:i}C'est pour toi, chéri.

46
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,720
{y:i}Merci, chérie.

47
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,600
Need a little help there?

48
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,160
- You dumb guinea.
- How the hell did I know he had a knife?

49
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,560
- Never trust a nigger.
- He could've been white.

50
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,560
- Never trust anyone. Goin' sick?
- No.

51
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,000
- Are you goin' sick?
- No!

52
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,160
- What d'you say we go to Chez for a drink?
- Jimmy, I'm beat. I'm gonna go home.

53
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,400
All right, all right. One drink.

54
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,400
- Drink this.
- Whip it out.

55
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,960
I make at least two junk connections
at that far table over in the corner.

56
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,640
The guy in the striped shirt and tie combo,

57
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,720
I know him too.

58
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,640
I thought we came here to buy me a drink.

59
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,040
Who is that clown?

60
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
It's a policy guy from Queens.

61
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,920
- Dig the creep that's comin' to the table now.
- It's Jewish Lucky.

62
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,640
He don't look the same
without numbers across his chest.

63
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,880
That table is definitely wrong.

64
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,240
More!

65
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,920
More!

66
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,800
What about the last of the big-time spenders?
Do you make him?

67
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920
No. You?

68
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,320
He's spreadin' it around like
the Russians are in Jersey.

69
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,920
Oh, yes.

70
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,040
What do you say we stick around
and give him a tail?

71
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,840
Come on. Just for fun.

72
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,440
Give who a tail?

73
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,960
The greaser with the blonde.

74
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,760
What for? You wanna play
hide the salami with his old lady?

75
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Yeah.

76
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,640
Miss, can I ask you
about those boots? They're...

77
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Monica.

78
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,320
- Who in the hell's that?
- Who keeps score?

79
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,440
- Kissy devil, isn't he? Look at him.
- Well, they're all cousins. You know that.

80
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,880
Yeah, say good-bye. Come on.
What's he got now?

81
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,320
- Hudson Terraplane, that's what he got.
- No, no.

82
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
- Easy.
- OK.

83
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Go to work.

84
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,080
Cloudy, I'll lay odds
he takes us to dago town.

85
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,000
We'll take him, Popeye. He's nothin'.

86
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,360
Seven o'clock in the morning.
I don't believe it.

87
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,600
Relax. You're havin' fun, ain't you?

88
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,200
If that's not a drop, I'll open
a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.

89
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,920
Make it Alexander's. I like the toy department.

90
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,160
He's comin' back.

91
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Pass him. Make a left.

92
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,880
Alain.

93
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,200
{y:i}Our friend's name is Boca.
{y:i}Salvatore Boca. B-O-C-A.

94
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,240
{y:i}They call him Sal. He's a sweetheart.

95
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,160
{y:i}He was picked up on suspicion
{y:i}of armed robbery. Now get this.

96
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,400
{y:i}Three years ago he tries to hold up Tiffany's
{y:i}on Fifth Avenue in broad daylight.

97
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,160
{y:i}He could've got two and a half to five,
{y:i}but Tiffany's wouldn't prosecute.

98
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,960
{y:i}Also, downtown they're pretty sure he pulled
{y:i}off a contract on a guy named DeMarco.

99
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,840
- "How about his old lady?"
- "Her name's Angie. She's a fast filly. "

100
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,840
{y:i}She drew a suspended
{y:i}for shoplifting a year ago.

101
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,200
{y:i}She's only a kid.
{y:i}19, according to the marriage license.

102
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,480
{y:i}19 goin' on 50.

103
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,320
- "What else?"
- "He's had the store a year and a half. "

104
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,680
{y:i}Takes in a fast seven grand a year.

105
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,800
{y:i}So what's he doin' with two cars
{y:i}and a tab at the Chez?

106
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,960
{y:i}The LTD's in his wife's name.
{y:i}The Comet belongs to his brother Lou.

107
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,640
{y:i}He's a trainee at the garbageman's
{y:i}school on Ward's Island.

108
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,560
"He did time a couple of years ago" -
{y:i}assault and robbery.

109
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,160
Black Cadillac.

110
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,400
New Jersey plates.

111
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,720
RWN-264. I know that one cat. We saw him
outside the Pike Slip Inn the other day.

112
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
I want a blouse like that for my girlfriend,
but you could model it.

113
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,280
Better not let my husband hear that.

114
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
I don't care if he hears it.
Will you do it for me?

115
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,720
OK. How much are you gonna pay?

116
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,400
- $50 an hour.
- 50 an hour?!

117
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,280
- I'll do it. $200.
- No, can't afford it.

118
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
I'll call you later. Bye-bye.

119
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,400
Hey, it's 1:30. I didn't expect you till two.

120
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,520
- You work around here?
- Across the street.

121
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,320
{y:i}That's the third time
{y:i}he's come here this week.

122
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,120
- "You got anything on this building?"
- "Clean. I checked the tenant list. "

123
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,560
{y:i}Remember Don Ameche, the actor?
{y:i}He lives here.

124
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,920
{y:i}Oh, yeah, and somebody else.

125
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,000
- "Does the name Joel Weinstock ring a bell?"
- "You're kidding. "

126
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,480
{y:i}No, sir. He lives right here.

127
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,760
{y:i}He was the bank on the shipment
{y:i}out of Mexico three years ago.

128
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,240
{y:i}Yeah, so I hear.

129
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,080
He's goin' to Ward's Island.
We'll be spotted. Why's he doin' that?

130
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,000
Maybe he's gonna go down
and see his brother.

131
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,640
Well, maybe it's another drop.

132
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,120
Well, he gets a free ride.

133
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,040
All right, Popeye's here!

134
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,160
Get your hands on your heads, get off the bar
and get on the wall! Come on, move, move!

135
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,320
Come on, move out! Face the wall.
Turn around there. Move!

136
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,320
- Hands outta your pockets.
- Turn around.

137
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,600
Turn around. Get on the wall.

138
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,520
Hey, did you drop that? Pick it up.

139
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,360
- Pick it up! Come on, move!
- What are you lookin' at?

140
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,440
All right, bring it here.
Get your hands outta your pockets.

141
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,360
- What's my name?
- Doyle.

142
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,240
- What?
- Mr Doyle.

143
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,960
Come here. D'you pick your feet?

144
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,480
Do you...? Get over there.
Get your hands on your head.

145
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,000
- Hold 'em up.
- We told you people we were comin' back.

146
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,760
We're gonna keep comin' back
until you clean this bar up.

147
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,200
Keep your eye on your neighbor.
If he drops somethin', it belongs to you.

148
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,440
What is this, a fuckin' hospital here? Huh?

149
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,320
Turn around there, fella.
What have we got here?

150
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,360
This belong to you? Huh?

151
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,200
Stand up there, noddy.

152
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,680
Get your hands on your fuckin' head.

153
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,640
- You wanna take a ride there, fat man?
- Oh, bullshit.

154
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,720
Pay attention.
We're gonna ask questions later.

155
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,080
Turn around.

156
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,480
All right, shut up there. Shut up!

157
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,360
Anybody want a milkshake?

158
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,320
All right, come over here. You and you.

159
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,360
Hey, whiskers! Come over here.

160
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,320
Move ass when I call you! You!

161
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,360
Come on, you, baldie. Come on, move.

162
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,800
All right, put it on the bar.

163
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,160
- Get it on the bar!
- Get the hell in there.

164
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,840
- Put your hands on your head.
- All of it.

165
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,520
Smart ass, you dropped somethin'. Pick it up.

166
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,240
You want that hand broken? Get it up there.

167
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
What else you got here, huh?

168
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,560
Turn around.

169
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,080
You're under arrest. That goes for you too.
Get in that phone booth. Move!

170
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,400
Get in there. Face the wall, put your hands
against the wall and lock yourself in.

171
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,360
Hey, you!

172
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,640
Haircut! Where are you going?

173
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
- You talkin' to me, baby?
- Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! Come here!

174
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,840
- What's happening?
- Where you been?

175
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
- In there.
- Can you stand a toss?

176
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,880
- Sure, I'm clean.
- You use shit?

177
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,800
No, man. Who are you, Dick Tracy
or somebody? I said I was clean.

178
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,960
- I'm not gonna get stuck, am I?
- I'm clean!

179
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,400
- If I do, you know what happens.
- Yeah. I said I'm clean.

180
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,000
Get off! I'll break your motherfuckin' ass!

181
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,600
Give me a nickel.
Give me a nickel. Come on!

182
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,360
I told you I'm clean. What the fuck
you wanna come down on me like that for?

183
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,040
This is goddamn full of shit.

184
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,360
- How's everything?
- Everything's everything, baby.

185
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,600
There's nothin' out there. It's all milk.

186
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:35,440
- There ain't nothin' around. Nobody's holdin'.
- I got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.

187
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,920
- Boca?
- Yeah. B-O-C-A.

188
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,280
- Never heard of him.
- What about his wife Angie?

189
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,880
Doesn't register.
There's been some talk, though.

190
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,240
- About what?
- A shipment.

191
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,800
Comin' in this week, the week after.
Everybody's gonna get well.

192
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,320
- Well, who's bringin' it?
- Who knows?

193
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,040
- Where do you want it?
- Huh?

194
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,720
- Where do you want it?
- Oh, shit. This side.

195
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,400
Beat it!

196
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm gonna check on this address.
If they don't know you, it's your ass.

197
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:25,480
- I thought I told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.

198
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,560
We're goin' now. Good-bye!

199
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,120
Move ass. Tell everybody
we'll be back in an hour.

200
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,760
Great, but you belong in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood.

201
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,440
Why don't you detach us? Give us a shot, at
least till we find out if there's anything here.

202
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:48,320
Everybody wants Weinstock. Maybe here's
the lead we're looking for. We deserve this.

203
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,200
You couldn't burn a three-time loser
with this garbage.

204
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,960
The man has done absolutely nothin'.
You'll wind up in an entrapment rap.

205
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,960
Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own
candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs.

206
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,720
You put this hustler together with Weinstock
and maybe we got a big score.

207
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,280
Big score, my ass! At best
he's sellin' nickel-and-dime bags.

208
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,240
I wouldn't be infringin' on your coffee break
if I thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.

209
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,600
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle,
or have you forgotten about that already?

210
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,480
Jesus Christ, Jimmy,
what's happened to you guys?

211
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:25,960
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in
arrests. What was it, over 100 again last year?

212
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,800
Terrific. But who? What did you bring in?

213
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,600
A high-school kid in short pants
that had a twitch?

214
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,480
You grab a bellhop because
he's got three joints in his sock?

215
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,080
Walter, we got the information
there's no shit on the street, right?

216
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,120
It's like a desert full ofjunkies
waiting to get well.

217
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,440
Goddamnit, this could be it. This little
candy-store guy, he's put on a big show

218
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,880
in a club with no narcotics connections.
They were all over him.

219
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,000
And after working a day and night,
we tail him to Brooklyn.

220
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,680
And we sat on him for practically a week, and
who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock.

221
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,160
Now you gotta let us have it.

222
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,360
Do you believe all this crap?

223
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,880
I go with my partner.

224
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,680
- What'll it take?
- A wire.

225
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,120
No, two wires.
One on the store, one on the house.

226
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,720
You know I have to get a court order
for a wire tap, don't you?

227
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,800
- But you'll try.
- We know you can do it, Walt.

228
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,800
Popeye, you still picking your feet
in Poughkeepsie?

229
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,760
{y:i}J'entends parler de ça.
{y:i}Je n'arrive pas a y croire.

230
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,880
{y:i}Alors je vais un peu parler pour moi.

231
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,320
{y:i}J'ai tendance a penser
{y:i}a mes propres problemes, enfin...

232
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,600
Monsieur Devereaux, is this
your first trip to New York?

233
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,040
- Yes, it's my first.
- Why did you choose to come by ship?

234
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,120
The next several weeks
will be very difficult for me,

235
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:03,080
and the ocean is the only place where
the telephone isn't ringing all the time.

236
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,200
Do you agree with the recent survey finding

237
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,800
that showed that Mayor Lindsay
was the sexiest man in the world?

238
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,880
{y:i}Tout a fait, oui.

239
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,520
Here's the warrants and the court order
for the wire tap. Judge gave you 60 days.

240
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,320
Mulderig and Klein'll sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.

241
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,480
Make sure you keep 'em informed
of everything that goes down.

242
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,760
You know Doyle there, don't you?

243
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,080
Yeah, I know Popeye. His brilliant hunches
cost the life of a good cop.

244
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,280
If this is the way you're comin' in on this,
why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?

245
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,440
- Because that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.

246
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,360
Whatever.

247
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,960
Bill, do me a favor, give them a chance.
He came in with a little basic information.

248
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,640
You worked with him, had some trouble,
but don't get off on the wrong foot.

249
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,360
- You have any problems, come to me.
- Simonson, just keep off my back.

250
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,960
Just try and cool it with him. If you have
any problems, come to me. I'll handle him.

251
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,800
- I'll be happy to work with him.
- He's a good cop.

252
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,000
- He's got good hunches once in a while.
- Fine. Just keep him off my back.

253
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,920
{y:i}Florida's Mackel Brothers
{y:i}invite you to join the great escape.

254
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,600
{y:i}You can say good-bye to air pollution,
{y:i}commuting, high prices, rising taxes

255
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,480
{y:i}and cold, depressing winters.

256
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,360
{y:i}Mackel Brothers will show you the way
{y:i}to Florida and fresh, clean air.

257
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,320
{y:i}Warm and sunny year-round weather
{y:i}in a home that you'll be proud to own.

258
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,160
{y:i}Call Mackel Brothers right now...

259
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Popeye.

260
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,680
Popeye.

261
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,760
- What?
- It's me, Cloudy. Open the door.

262
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,800
I can't.

263
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,880
- What do you mean, you can't? You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

264
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Let yourself in, will you?

265
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
What happened?

266
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
That crazy kid.

267
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,760
She locked me up with my own cuffs.

268
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,240
- Where's the keys?
- Over there.

269
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,440
Hi there.

270
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,880
Anybody hurt in this wreck?

271
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,280
I thought I told you to get
plastic folders for this stuff.

272
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,320
Your scrapbook is like you.

273
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,080
- A mess.
- Give me my pants, will you?

274
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,640
Come on.

275
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,360
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.

276
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,200
I also got two feds. Mulderig and Klein.

277
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,680
What do we need those pricks for?

278
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,440
Because our department's got
about 908 bucks to make buys,

279
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,280
and they can get all they want
from Uncle Sap. Hello.

280
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,240
These yours, darling?

281
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,360
30 over here for this gentleman. Can I get 35?

282
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,600
- 35 here.
- 35 over here. Can I get 38?

283
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,040
- Yeah, right here.
- 38 over here. How about 40?

284
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,880
- 40.
- 40 over here. I got 40. Can I get 41? 41?

285
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,560
40 once, 40 twice.
Sold to the gentleman for $40.

286
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,480
We come now to the next number: 42399.

287
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,280
- 10 bucks.
- I got $10 over here. Do I hear 12?

288
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,840
- 12.
- 12 over here, 12. Can I get 14?

289
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,480
- 14.
- 14 over here. How about 16? Can I get 16?

290
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,640

296
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,080
25 once, 25 twice.
Sold to the gentleman for 25.

297
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,960
Every car sold here...

298
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,120
- "Where are you?"
- "Taking care of business. "

299
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,040
{y:i}What do you mean, taking care of business?
{y:i}It's after midnight.

300
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,040
{y:i}You know, I had to meet some people tonight.

301
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,040
{y:i}Well, finish all your meetin'people and get
{y:i}back here now. And bring a pizza with you.

302
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,800
{y:i}Where am I gonna get
{y:i}a pizza this time of night?

303
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,080
{y:i}Well, try, OK?

304
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,800
{y:i}I don't know where I'm gonna
{y:i}find a pizza joint open.

305
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,640
- "Sal?"
- "Yeah. "

306
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,120
"Don't forget"- "anchovies. "

307
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,560
- "Salvatore?"
- "Yes. Yeah, yeah. Hello. "

308
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,480
- Who is it?
- "Yeah, this is Sal. How are you?"

309
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,000
- Sounds like a foreigner.
- "You meet me Wednesday at the hotel, OK?"

310
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,800
- Sounds French.
- "Will I expect you?"

311
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,560
- "Yeah. What time?"
- "12 o'clock. Yes?"

312
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,640
{y:i}Yeah. Yes.

313
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,480
Strictly small potatoes.
You sure can pick 'em, Doyle.

314
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,160
Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

315
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,640
Someone told me the reason
why you do that is

316
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,520
when you meet a chick
and you rub up against her,

317
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,000
she can't tell you're a cop.

318
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,320
I said it's bullshit. It's gotta be
a fast-draw gimmick or somethin'.

319
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,840
Bill, why don't you knock it off, huh?

320
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,760
He's gettin' too far ahead.

321
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,200
You're gonna lose him.

322
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,040
For Christ's sake, move the car!

323
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,640
What the hell is goin' on here?

324
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,880
Klein, this is Cloudy. Do you read me?

325
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,840
Come in, for Christ's sakes!

326
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,920
{y:i}This is Cloudy. Do you read me?
{y:i}Listen, we lost him on the bridge.

327
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,680
Right. I got him.
He's headin' north on East River Drive.

328
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Excuse me.

329
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,840
You take Sal. I'll take the beard.

330
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,600
There goes Sal.

331
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,000
- You want the red or the white?
- Pour it in your ear.

332
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:02,280
- Yes, sir?
- Yeah, guy just walked in, what's his name?

333
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,200
I'm pretty sure that one's a Frog.

334
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,280
He made me, too.

335
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,760
He lives on four, he went up to six.
He's cute, real cute.

336
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,400
The other guy's a Frog. He checked
into the Edison. Had a hooker sent up.

337
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,240
You should have collared him right there.

338
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,080
- Who's on him?
- Klein.

339
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,880
- How about Sal?
- We put him to bed for the night.

340
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,840
Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
You look like shit.

341
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,520
Come on.

342
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,920
Look, my partner and I made
this case, you know, originally.

343
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,120
- We don't want any feds screwing it up.
- Case? So far you haven't shown me a thing.

344
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,920
You keep shootin' your mouth off,
I'm gonna knock you right into next week.

345
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,680
- Knock it off.
- Don't tell me to knock it off.

346
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,240
Cut it out, will ya, for Christ's sakes!

347
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:49,120
There's nothin' goin' down. Get some sleep.

348
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,520
Blastoff. 180.

349
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,960
200. Good Housekeeping seal of approval.

350
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,400
210. US government certified.

351
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,880
220. Lunar trajectory.

352
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,440
Junk-of-the-month club. Sirloin steak.

353
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,200
230. Grade-A poison.

354
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,240
Absolute dynamite.

355
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,600
89 per cent pure junk. Best I've ever seen.

356
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,040
If the rest is like this,
you'll be dealin' on this load for two years.

357
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,960
- It's worth the half million?
- How many kilos?

358
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,160
- 60.
- 60 kilos...

359
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,400
Eight big ones a kilo, right? This stuff'll
take a seven-to-one hit on the street.

360
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,440
By the time it gets down to
nickel bags, it'll be 32 million.

361
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:32,560
Thank you, Howard. Take what's left
there with you and good night.

362
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,960
Uh-uh. Not that one. The little one.

363
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,160
- I guess we got a deal, huh?
- What we got here, Sal, is a test.

364
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,440
A deal for half a million dollars? Maybe.

365
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,480
Maybe?

366
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,520
Come on, the guy's in a hurry. He wants
the bread. He wants to go back to France.

367
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,680
This guy's not gonna play games. Look, he's
one of the shrewdest cats I ever come across.

368
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,840
What am I, a schmuck? What's the hurry?

369
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:03,400
He could see a couple of shows,
visit the top of the Empire State Building.

370
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,280
Don't jerk me, Weinstock.
I spent a lot of time settin' this one up.

371
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,800
So what do you want, a badge?
This is your first major-league game, Sal.

372
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,840
One thing I learned: Move calmly,
move cautiously, you'll never be sorry.

373
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,440
Look, I've been damn careful up to now.

374
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,720
This is why your phone lines are tapped and
the feds are crawlin' all over you like fleas.

375
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:29,360
- He'll take the deal somewhere else.
- Let him take it and find out how easy it is

376
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,640
to put together a half a million in cash.
There's no hurry to do this kind of business.

377
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:36,840
The stuff is here!
We can make the switch in an hour!

378
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,720
Look, I'm tellin' you,
he'll split if we don't move.

379
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,360
This guy's got 'em like that.
He's everything they say he is.

380
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,360
What about you, Sal?
Are you everything they say you are?

381
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,520
That son of a bitch.

382
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,160
Thank you.

383
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,440
- Hello?
- This is Doyle. I'm sittin' on Frog One.

384
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,440
Yeah, I know that. We got
the Westbury covered like a tent.

385
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,880
The Westbury, my ass! I got him
on the shuttle at Grand Central.

386
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,120
Now what the hell's goin' on up there?

387
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,000
I make him comin' out of the hotel.
He was free as a bird.

388
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,920
What the hell are you talkin' about?

389
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,200
Yeah, well, uh...

390
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,680
Listen, I don't care how many
bartenders you got that are sick.

391
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,320
No, I'm not workin' that joint.

392
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,840
That's right. Same to ya, buddy.

393
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Can I get a grape drink?

394
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,840
{y:i}Watch the closing doors.

395
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,720
Son of a bitch!

396
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,480
Hi. Can I have a round-trip
ticket to Washington?

397
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,360
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

398
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:06,440
Cash is $54. Please print your name
on both tickets before you board the plane.

399
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,680
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Have a nice flight.

400
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,400
- Yes, sir?
- Round trip to Washington.

401
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,400
- So?
- So everything's goin' great.

402
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,800
Terrific. Beautiful.

403
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,200
I'll need a few more days, though.

404
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,640
The boys think we oughta cool it for a while,
just to make sure there's no heat.

405
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,600
You must take me for an imbecile.

406
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:55,680
Why do you think I asked you
to meet me in Washington?

407
01:00:55,800 --> 01:01:00,080
I haven't spent five minutes in New York City
without the company of a policeman.

408
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,880
Look, I'm levelin' with you.
I need a little more time.

409
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,800
My people think we oughta find a better time
to make the switch, that's all.

410
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,320
It has to be by the end of this week.

411
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,360
Look, Charnier, you gotta be reasonable.

412
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,760
It's your problem.

413
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,240
Well, it's your problem, too.

414
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,720
So nice to have seen you again.

415
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,200
We found a set of works
on the kid driving the sports car.

416
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,520
- His girlfriend's in the back. She's dead.
- Give the car a toss.

417
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,440
- I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
- Jimmy, give it up. It's all over with.

418
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:11,920
If there was a deal, it's gone down by now.
We blew our warrants and we blew our cover.

419
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Listen, I know the deal hasn't gone down.
I know it. I can feel it. I'm dead certain.

420
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:20,960
Last time you were dead certain,
we ended up with a dead cop.

421
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,840
Break it up! Will you two break it up?

422
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,960
Stop it! Hold on to yourself.
What's the matter with you?

423
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:33,840
Jimmy, you wasted two months on this.
No collars are comin' in

424
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:37,640
while you're runnin' around town
jerkin' off! Now go back to work!

425
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,840
You're off special assignment!

426
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,320
Get down! Get out! Get outta the area!

427
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,920
Leave her alone! Stay away!
Leave her alone. There's a sniper up there!

428
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,280
Stop that man! He's wanted by the police!

429
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,880
- What's the next stop into the city?
- 25th Avenue.

430
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,880
Hold it!

431
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,040
Hold it!

432
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,000
Police emergency. I need your car.

433
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:43,640
When am I gonna get it back?

434
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:51,960
For Christ's sake!

435
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,400
Hold it! Stop! Halt!

436
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,480
- Don't stop.
- But...

437
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,320
- Don't stop or I'll kill you.
- I gotta stop in the next station.

438
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,840
Touch the brakes and I'll blow you in half.

439
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,280
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know. Sit down, buddy. Relax.

440
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:27,040
Coke! Coke, you all right?

441
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,040
Hey, Coke, you all right?

442
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,120
Don't answer.

443
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,600
Hey, Coke, you all right?

444
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,520
- Get back.
- Relax.

445
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,440
Keep going.

446
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:19,440
You're not gonna get away with this.
Put the gun down.

447
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,640
Get back!

448
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,840
- Come on, now.
- I said get back!

449
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,480
Stop!

450
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,440
Hold it!

451
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,880
Let's get outta here!

452
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:41,080
Come on, come on. Shake your ass.

453
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:00,600
Can't seem to find the damn ticket.

454
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,480
- Where's the guy?
- He's gettin' my car. He's in the back.

455
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,320
Thank you.

456
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,640
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yeah.

457
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,320
- You got your ticket?
- I must have dropped mine.

458
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,800
What kinda ticket did you have?

459
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,760
He's in the brown Lincoln. Foreign plates.

460
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,560
He's walking towards Front Street.

461
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,880
{y:i}Got him. Angie's parked over here in the LTD.

462
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,000
{y:i}Cute. You stay with her.
{y:i}We're gonna sit on the Lincoln.

463
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,640
The car's dirty, Cloudy.

464
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,920
We're gonna sit here all night if we have to.

465
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,880
What time is it?

466
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:44,040
Ten after four.

467
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,960
- Huh?
- Ten after four.

468
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,360
That's the third time
those guys have been around.

469
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,960
All right, let's hit 'em. Hit 'em!

470
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,760
Freeze!

471
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,640
Nobody move! Put your hands in the air!

472
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,200
Stay right there. If you move,
I'll blow your fuckin' head off.

473
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,880
- What the hell's that?
- What are you doin'? Turn around.

474
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:08,920
Who's the boss here? Who's runnin' this
outfit? You are? What are you doin' here?

475
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:12,400
- Just runnin' around.
- Who sent you down here? Don't talk back.

476
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:14,920
- What are you doin' here?
- We saw the car.

477
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,480
We was breaking down the tires.
That's all it was.

478
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,560
Lock 'em up.

479
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,520
Come on, come on!

480
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,120
Nothin' but a bunch of lousy spic car thieves!

481
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:46,200
- Nothin' there except a New York City map.
- Are you bullshittin' me?

482
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:48,800
That car's dirty.

483
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:51,240
Take it in and tear it apart.

484
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,520
Tear it out.

485
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,080
Nothin' here, Jimmy.

486
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,920
This is all solid.

487
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,800
There's nobody been under that car
since it came from the factory.

488
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,040
That thing is clean.

489
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,360
I don't buy that, Irv.

490
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,560
The stuff is in that car.

491
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,960
Well, you find it. I can't.

492
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,360
{y:i}Enfin on ne va pas passer la journée ici.
{y:i}Ça fait deux heures qu'on est Ia.

493
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,760
{y:i}Soyez patient.

494
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:09,160
Look, the car was lost sometime last night.

495
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,920
First they send us to Pier One,
then here. Then what?

496
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:14,400
Why did you park the car
down by the waterfront?

497
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,760
You're staying in midtown Manhattan
and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?

498
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,880
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations
for a film for French television.

499
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,160
He probably left the car to look at something.

500
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:29,240
We were told by the police commissioner
that the car was brought to this garage.

501
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:32,440
- I demand its immediate return.
- You have to be patient.

502
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,520
We get four or five hundred cars here a day.

503
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,440
Monsieur Devereaux is
an important guest of this country.

504
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:41,680
He is working with the absolute cooperation
and participation of your government.

505
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,320
Here are his credentials
from the French consulate.

506
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:49,320
Unless you wish to see this in his film,
I suggest you locate the car immediately.

507
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:55,680
You're in a no-smoking area, sir. Would
you please extinguish your cigarettes?

508
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,720
What was the weight of
the car when you got it, Irv?

509
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:22,240
4795 pounds.

510
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,000
You sure?

511
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,880
That's what it was. 4795 pounds
when it came into the shop.

512
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:38,360
Owner's manual says 4675.

513
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:42,200
That's 120 pounds overweight.

514
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:48,600
And when it was booked
into Marseilles it was 4795.

515
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:52,520
That's still 120 pounds overweight.
Jimmy's gotta be right.

516
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,720
Listen, I ripped everything outta there
except the rocker panels.

517
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,840
Come on, Irv. What the hell is that?

518
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,880
Shit.

519
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,840
Son of a bitch.

520
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,920
All right.

521
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,480
I got it for you, Randy.
It just came in from downtown.

522
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,120
- Who's Devereaux?
- I am Mr Devereaux. Why?

523
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:49,160
I'm sorry, Mr Devereaux, but we get a lot
of cars here and it's hard to keep track...

524
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,400
- You mean the car is here now?
- Oh, yeah. It's right outside.

525
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:55,680
They stole it right off
the street from you, huh?

526
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:59,520
Goddamn. You're gonna have to pay
the towing charge, you know.

527
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:03,080
I was told these things happen in
New York, but one never expects it.

528
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,240
Yeah, well, that's New York.
Is this your first trip over here?

529
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:08,480
Yes. Where's my car, please?

530
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:14,240
It's right over here.
You're lucky this time. It's in perfect shape.

531
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,040
Not a scratch. You must lead a charming life.

532
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:40,200
Henri.

533
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,160
{y:i}Je vous attendais.

534
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,120
Let's go!

535
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:10,120
I wouldn't be surprised if I'd been followed.

536
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:32,200
- Listen, I'll see you at Pop's tonight.
- OK, babe. Take care.

537
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:32,680
They got the bridge blocked off!

538
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,920
This is the police. You're surrounded.

539
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,400
Come out with your hands up!

540
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:06,280
This is the police. You're surrounded.

541
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:04,520
Give 'em the gas!

542
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,960
Hold your fire!

543
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:25,280
Stop!

544
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,760
They're comin' out! Hold your fire!

545
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,840
Popeye. It's me, it's me.

546
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:04,840
Frog One is in that room.

547
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,480
Drop it!

548
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,640
Mulderig.

549
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,760
You shot Mulderig.

550
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:18,720
The son of a bitch is here.
I saw him. I'm gonna get him.

551
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:53,360
