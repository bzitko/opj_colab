2
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,880
Hundred percent, Utah. Good job.

3
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,760
Hi. Johnny Utah.

4
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,920
Your 9:00 appointment is here.

5
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,440
Special Agent John Utah,
day number one in L.A. Welcome aboard.

6
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,840
- Your personnel record, very impressive.
- Thank you.

7
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,800
You may have been in top 2 percent
of your class at Quantico...

8
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,320
...but quite frankly, son, out here, you have
exactly zero hours of experience in the field.

9
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,240
You know nothing, in fact,
less than nothing.

10
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,760
If you even knew you knew nothing,
that'd be something.

11
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,960
Yes, sir.

12
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,640
- You eat a solid breakfast?
- Sir?

13
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,640
All the food groups,
avoiding caffeine, sugar?

14
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,880
I like that all my people maintain
sound cardiovascular fitness.

15
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
We don't drink, and we don't smoke.

16
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,640
- Sir, I take the skin off chicken.
- Good man.

17
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,840
- Bank Robbery.
- All right, I got it.

18
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,280
You are now in the
bank-robbery capital of the world.

19
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
Thirteen hundred
and twenty-two last year.

20
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,160
- Up 26 percent from the year before.
- That's correct.

21
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
We nailed over 1000 of them.

22
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,000
Miss Deer, take a look at that for me.
Thank you.

23
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,320
Do you know how we nail the bad guys?
Do you know how we nail them?

24
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,160
By crunching data,
good crime-scene work, good lab work...

25
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,600
...and most importantly,
good data-based analysis.

26
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,920
Special Agent Utah,
are you receiving my signal?

27
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,920
Zero distortion, sir.

28
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,600
I love these things.

29
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,400
You're a real blue-flame special,
aren't you, son?

30
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,320
Young, dumb and full of come. I know.

31
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,360
What I don't know
is how you got yourself assigned...

32
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
...out here in Los Angeles with us.

33
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,520
I mean, hell.

34
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I guess we just must have ourselves
an asshole shortage, huh?

35
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,280
Yeah? You're on.

36
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,560
Not so far.

37
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,880
Okay.

38
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,600
- Pappas?
- Yeah?

39
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
Here, put on the blindfold.

40
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,160
I wanna see you retrieve
at least two bricks off the bottom.

41
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
One...

42
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,760
...two.

43
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,200
There.

44
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,240
I've been in the field for 22 years...

45
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,560
...I fired my piece over 19 times
in the line of duty.

46
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,120
I got no idea what a blind man fetching
bricks from the bottom of the pool...

47
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,040
...has got to do
with being a special agent.

48
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,400
Added to which indignity, I have
been saddled with some blue-flamer...

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
...Quantico cat.

50
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,360
Some quarterback punk.

51
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,360
Johnny Unitas or something.

52
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
- The shit they pull, huh?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,760
- Hey, Angie.
- What?

54
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,200
Here's your guy.

55
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
What?

56
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,960
Pappas. Angelo Pappas.

57
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,680
Punk. Quarterback punk.

58
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,120
Hmm.

59
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,160
Welcome to Sea World, kid.

60
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,680
Good luck, Pappas.

61
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,200
Two bricks, coming up.

62
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,560
Little hand says it's time to rock 'n' roll.

63
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,600
- Everybody freeze!
- Nobody move!

64
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,320
Keep your hands up and your eyes down!

65
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,040
Back away from the Counters!
Hands on your head now!

66
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,280
Everybody out
from behind your desk. On the floor.

67
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,480
Move it! Move it! Now! Get down!

68
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,400
What's the matter with you people?

69
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,440
Gut of the cubicle. Get out of my way.

70
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,080
Now back away from the counter
and get your fucking hands up!

71
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,960
Hey, bitch, what's the matter
with you? You got earwax?

72
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,600
Keep your hands where I can see them!

73
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
- Get down, now!
- Hands up.

74
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,480
Hello, hello, hello, ladies and gentlemen.
We are the ex-presidents.

75
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,080
And we need just a few moments
of your time.

76
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
We've been screwing you for years
so a few more seconds shouldn't matter.

77
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,520
On the floor, asshole.

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,440
The money's insured
so it's not worth dying for.

79
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,840
- How you doing, Dick?
- Implementing our own personal plan...

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
...of deregulation, Mr. President.

81
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,120
- Time, Mr. Carter.
- Sixty.

82
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,000
- LBJ?
- We're styling.

83
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,200
Oh, Ron, I got Nancy on the line.

84
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,000
Whoo! Ha, ha.

85
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,680
Eighty.
Air Force One is waiting, Mr. President.

86
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

87
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,800
Get your hands where I can see them!
Thank you.

88
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,240
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
And please don't forget to vote.

89
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,920
I'm not a crook.

90
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Twenty-seven banks in three years.

91
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,160
God. In and out in 90 seconds.

92
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,600
No one ever gets shot.
Now, what are we talking about here?

93
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,600
We're talking about solid professionals.

94
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,560
- Good moves.
- Yeah.

95
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,640
They control the room well...

96
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,680
...and they stick strictly
to the cash drawers.

97
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,320
They don't go for the vault?

98
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,760
No, they never go for the vault.
They never get greedy.

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,200
- Smart. You burn time in the vault.
- Yup, that's right.

100
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,840
Reagan usually does the driving.

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,240
Stolen switch car,
they leave it running on the curb.

102
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,920
It looks parked from a distance.

103
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,040
And when they run,
they dump the vehicle and they vanish.

104
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,840
Like a virgin on prom night.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,080
I mean, they vanish.

106
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,280
Surgical.

107
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Look at them separate the dye pack.

108
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,000
Dick and Ronnie know their jobs.

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,520
The ex-presidents are the best
I've ever seen, ever.

110
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,960
Any time you two have finished jerking off
watching MTV...

111
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,600
...we need a look at these tapes.

112
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,520
Hey, Pappas, you, uh, tell the kid
your theory on the presidents?

113
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,160
Just take the tapes and go, Babbitt.

114
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,280
Hang ten, Pappas, like totally rad, dude.

115
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,080
I tell you, the department loves it.

116
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,440
What's he talking about?

117
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
- Found the drop car on Mulholland Drive..
- We'll go work it.

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,880
- Oh, no.
- Angelo?

119
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,560
- Come on.
- Thank you.

120
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,360
- We'll go work it.
- Good.

121
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,160
Excuse me.

122
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,720
I'm working a fucking drop car.
I don't believe it. Working a drop car.

123
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,960
Pappas. What a hard-on.

124
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,440
- Keep them away from there.
- All right.

125
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,840
- Yeah, well...
- Came around the corner...

126
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,440
Four fifty-nine, called it in about 5:25.

127
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,640
This car doesn't have AC.
Today was a scorcher.

128
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,000
Sweat secretions in the setbacks.

129
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,840
Are you through, Mr. Wizard?

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,320
Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa
under the seat while you're at it.

131
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,800
Yo, can you photograph this?

132
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,400
Oh, look at this. It's 7:30.

133
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,840
The night is still so young.

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,160
The way you're going,
you'll solve this case and start another one.

135
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,680
Drop car, my ass. Goddamn.

136
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,320
You been working Bank Robbery,
what, 22 years?

137
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,680
Yeah, 22 years.

138
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,200
Man, L.A. has changed a lot
during that time.

139
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,960
- The air got dirty and the sex got clean.
- Uh-huh.

140
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,040
So a guy with that kind of time in
must have a theory about these guys.

141
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,080
Leave it alone, Johnny.

142
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,040
Okay, fine, you've given up, fine.
It doesn't mean I have to.

143
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,600
Hey, hey, listen.
Forget about it, kid. They are ghosts.

144
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah, of course.

145
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,880
What am I thinking? If you couldn't crack it
with all your years of experience...

146
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
...it's impossible to conceive
that I might have something to offer, right?

147
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,000
Well, maybe I can do better
than some over-the-hill burnout.

148
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,080
- Watch your mouth.
- Maybe you ought to take...

149
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,080
...some early retirement right now.

150
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,720
And get some rent-a-cop, night-security job,
tell Nam stories.

151
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,120
Listen, you snot-nosed little shit!
I was taking shrapnel in Khe Sanh...

152
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,080
...while you were crapping in your hands
and rubbing it on your face!

153
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,640
- You mad?
- Yeah, I'm mad!

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
- Good and mad?
- Yeah, what you wanna do about it?

155
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,840
Feels good, doesn't it?
Like you're still alive, right?

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,240
- Yeah!
- Well, since you're still alive...

157
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,120
...and you're not in the box just yet,
why don't you tell me this theory of yours...

158
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,800
...and we'll go get these guys?

159
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,520
Okay, hotshot.

160
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,800
You wanna nail the bank robbers
and be a big hero?

161
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,240
- Definitely.
- Definitely.

162
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Then here it is.

163
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,040
The ex-presidents are surfers.

164
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,120
- Surfers?
- Surfers.

165
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,600
It's in our face.
Look at the tan line on this guy.

166
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,360
- Oh, well, he must be a surfer.
- Well, yeah.

167
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,440
So last year, Nixon scuffs the counter
when he's going over...

168
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
...so there is a soil sample.

169
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Non-specific mud.

170
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,800
Traces of asphalt, traces of oil.

171
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,040
Traces of sand, carnauba wax.

172
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,360
So I become a wax expert.
Now, there's 80-some uses for this stuff.

173
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,200
Something like 500 products.

174
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,440
Candle wax, car wax, mustache wax.

175
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,520
It could be anything.

176
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,720
Guy's waxing his mustache
at the beach...

177
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,640
...gets sand in it...

178
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,400
...takes it off with a shoe.

179
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,960
Shoe scuffs the counter...

180
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,840
- Would you just shut up a minute?
- Ha, ha.

181
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,960
Just listen, maybe you'll learn something.
The lab gave us three possible matches.

182
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,560
This is one of them.

183
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,320
- Sex Wax.
- Yeah.

184
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,200
You're not into kinky shit, are you,
Angelo?

185
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,720
Ha, ha. Not yet. Surfers use this.
They rub it on their boards for traction.

186
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,160
- Thanks for the tip.
- You're welcome for the tip.

187
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,680
And here's another tip.

188
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,040
Check out the dates on these robberies.

189
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,960
It's strictly a summer job for these idiots.

190
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
Four months.

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,440
June to October.

192
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,040
- Same the year before.
- That's right.

193
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,440
We have one more month.
We won't see them till next summer.

194
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,600
They're traveling on the money,
going where the waves are.

195
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,920
That's right.

196
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,440
Ha!

197
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,240
The ex-presidents rip off banks
to finance their endless summer.

198
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,080
Whoa!

199
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,880
Hey, man, a lot of guys your age
are learning to surf.

200
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,360
It's cool. There's nothing wrong with it.

201
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,800
- I'm 25.
- That's what I'm saying. It's never too late.

202
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
Hope you stick with it.

203
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,880
Surfing's the source, can change your life.
Swear to God.

204
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,760
Why can't I just walk around
with this thing under my arm...

205
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,800
...and act stoned, ask a few questions?

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
Well, look.

207
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
Look at them.
They're like some kind of tribe.

208
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,280
They got their own language.

209
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,640
You can't just walk up to those guys.
You have to get out there...

210
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,400
...and learn the moves, get into their head,
pick up the speech.

211
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,280
You trying to tell me the FBI
is going to pay me to learn to surf?

212
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,160
It's either you or me out there on the board.
Get my drift?

213
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,960
Angelo, this is for little rubber people
who don't shave yet.

214
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,640
Come on, you're the quarterback jock.
It's all balance, right?

215
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,760
And coordination.

216
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,480
How hard can it be?

217
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,840
Hold on.

218
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,600
Hold on.

219
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,120
Use your arms.

220
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,560
Paddle. Come on.

221
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,680
Use your arms.

222
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,520
It's all right, come on. You're okay.

223
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
You crazy son of a bitch.

224
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
You wanna commit suicide,
you do it someplace else.

225
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,360
This pig board piece of shit.

226
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,720
You got no business out here
whatsoever.

227
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,520
Hey.

228
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,000
My name's Johnny Utah.

229
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,440
Who cares?

230
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,960
That is your surfing contact?

231
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,520
Female, blue eyes, black hair...

232
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,920
...5'6", 119 pounds.

233
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,800
God, Utah.

234
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,720
Not bad, Utah.

235
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,160
"Tyler Ann Endicott, born 11/27/64."

236
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,480
Exhibition of speed.

237
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,800
"Indecent exposure
inside moving vehicle."

238
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,320
Hot, very hot.

239
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,200
What else they got on her?

240
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,280
I still haven't found anything I can use.

241
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,160
I gotta find an approach. A way in.

242
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,880
Here we go.

243
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,320
"Both parents deceased.

244
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
Airplane crash, San Diego, '84."

245
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,040
Yeah.

246
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,680
Definitely.

247
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,200
See you later, man.

248
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,360
Next?

249
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,920
What do you want?

250
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,200
Shrimp and fries.

251
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,160
I mean, what do you want?

252
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,920
- Why do you keep hanging around here?
- I need you to teach me.

253
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,040
Give me a break.
Uh, shrimp and fries...

254
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,120
...to go.

255
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
- Would you like something to drink, sir?
- I'm serious.

256
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,400
I can see that you're serious. Forget it.

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,080
Stick to tennis.

258
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,720
I don't know, whatever you do good.
Uh, miniature golf. Your number's 37.

259
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,960
You don't understand.

260
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,720
I'm gonna learn to surf or break my neck.

261
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,640
What is it?

262
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,560
You all of a sudden got this bug
that you just have to go surfing?

263
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,920
- This is a line, right?
- No, no.

264
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,920
See...

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,920
My whole life I've done things
for other people.

266
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,280
In high school, I played football
because my old man expected me to.

267
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,520
Mm-hm.

268
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,760
Then my parents always figured
I'd go to law school.

269
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,200
So I did. Football scholarship.
Phi Beta Kappa...

270
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,600
- Is this gonna take a really long time?
- Wait.

271
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,440
So I'm a big hero to my folks, right?

272
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,000
But two years ago,
they were killed in a car wreck.

273
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,560
You can't imagine it.

274
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,040
Your whole life changes.

275
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,880
And I suddenly realized
that all my goals had been their goals...

276
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,360
...and I hadn't been living my own life...

277
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,560
...so I wanted something for myself.

278
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,960
So I come out here from Ohio
a month ago.

279
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
I've never seen the ocean before.
Any ocean.

280
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,360
I never thought
it would affect me so much.

281
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm drawn to it.

282
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,880
Or something.

283
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,480
I wanna do what you do.

284
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,120
It's the truth.

285
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,960
All right.

286
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,600
Okay. Tomorrow, here, 6 a.m.

287
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,240
If you are one minute late, I'm gone.

288
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,840
And, stud, I didn't take you on to raise,
so I'll teach you a few things...

289
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,920
...and then after that,
you're gonna be on your own, okay?

290
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,760
Oh, God.

291
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,040
Stop here.

292
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,440
You agree to do exactly
what I say when I say it?

293
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,040
Sure.

294
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,720
Pop.Pop.

295
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,920
You stand straight up, you're just gonna fall
right over, so let's try it again.

296
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,360
Start over. Just do it again.

297
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,200
Hey, what you doing, huh?

298
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,960
Just do it again. Pop up.

299
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,320
- You gotta stay low, you're gonna bite it.
- Ha, ha.

300
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,200
You dragged your knee that time,
you'll just wipe out.

301
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,000
You're dragging your foot,
you're gonna be fish food.

302
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,800
Both feet have to land on the board
at the same time.

303
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
That's it. That's it. You're surfing.

304
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,000
Whoo!

305
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,720
Yeah!

306
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,960
Whoa!

307
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,320
You're doing all right, city boy.

308
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
Whoo!

309
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,440
Yeah.

310
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,840
You are surfing.

311
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,520
That's Bodhi.

312
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,480
They call him the Bodhisattva.

313
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,920
He's a modern savage.

314
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,680
He's a real Searcher.

315
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,240
What's he searching for?

316
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,160
The ride.

317
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,400
The ultimate ride.

318
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,280
The guy's even crazier than you, Johnny.

319
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,120
Not bad.

320
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,000
Yeah.

321
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,560
Hey.

322
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,640
- Okay.
- Whoo!!

323
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,240
Heads up.

324
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
- Hey!
- Aah!

325
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Put me down.

326
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,120
Uh, we know each other.

327
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,840
That's a...

328
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,720
That's a Surfboard, all right.

329
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,760
Looks like a '57 Chevy I used to have.

330
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,120
Uh, Tyler, come here.

331
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,520
So, uh...

332
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,400
...who's the guy? You replace me?

333
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,040
- Give me a break. Where you been?
- He surfs real well.

334
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,080
Come on.
He's from Kansas or something.

335
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,920
- He's from Kansas?
- Heads up.

336
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,200
Yeah. Good catch.

337
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,360
Ready. Set. Hut! Hut!

338
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,120
Go, Roach. Go, go, go.

339
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,880
Hut!

340
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,640
Hut.

341
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,880
That's right, get him.
Go get him. Get him.

342
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,480
Hut.

343
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,480
I'm open.

344
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,760
Oh!

345
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Nice pass. Lousy catch.

346
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,240
Yeah! Ha, ha!

347
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,200
Yes, mama. Yes, baby.

348
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,280
Whose ball is it? Who wants it?

349
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,360
Go, go. go.

350
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Hut.

351
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,160
- Get him.
- Get him.

352
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,120
Very bad.

353
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,840
Ready.

354
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,480
Set.

355
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,080
Hut.

356
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,600
Go, go.

357
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,200
Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't you think that's a little out of line?

358
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
- Whoa, cool it. Don't you know who this is?
- I don't know who this is.

359
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,000
This is Johnny Utah.

360
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,880
Ohio State Buckeyes, all conference.
Remember?

361
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,480
Number nine, man. How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

362
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,400
Johnny fucking Utah.
Sorry. Didn't mean to get in your face.

363
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,240
I knew I knew you. It was the Rose Bowl.
Three years ago, you beat SC, right?

364
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,000
- You? You did this?
- That was one hell of a game.

365
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,680
No shit.

366
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,040
Yeah, but you got nuked
in the last quarter.

367
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,440
Yeah, I got my knee folded back
about 90 degrees the wrong way.

368
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:04,360
- Whoa, that's why you never went pro?
- Two years of surgery, missed my window.

369
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,960
Went through law school instead.

370
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,320
Law school?

371
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,240
You're a lawyer?

372
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,240
Well, life's not over yet, man.
You're surfing.

373
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,040
Lawyers don't surf.

374
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,040
This one does.

375
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,560
- Let's go!
- Let's play some football.

376
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,280
Special Agent Utah,
this is not some job...

377
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,520
...flipping burgers at the local drive-in.

378
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Yes, the Surfboard bothers me.

379
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,240
Yes, your approach to this whole
goddamn case bothers me.

380
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,680
And, yes, you bother me!

381
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,920
And Pappas, oh, for the love of Christ...

382
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,040
...just how the hell did I ever even let you
talk me into this whole boneheaded idea?

383
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,120
Harp, we're working undercover.
It takes time.

384
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,520
- We've produced a few...
- No, no, no, no, no!

385
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,040
Let me tell you what you've produced.

386
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,360
Over the last two weeks,
you two have produced exactly squat!

387
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,000
Squat!

388
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,680
During which time the ex-presidents
have robbed two more banks!

389
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,040
Now, for Christ's sake...

390
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,280
...does either one of you have anything
even remotely interesting to tell me?

391
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,600
Caught my first tube this morning...

392
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,240
...sir.

393
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,400
Goddamn it.

394
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,960
- Why didn't you leave that in the car?
- It sticks out so I can't lock it.

395
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,000
Anyway, what's his problem?
We're handling our caseload.

396
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,760
- I'm surfing on my own time.
- I know, just don't rub Harp's nose in it.

397
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,680
Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI
to learn to surf?

398
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,400
This was your lame-o idea in the first place.
You gotta back me up on this.

399
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,000
Johnny, we better come up
with something real quick.

400
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,240
- My friend.
- What?

401
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,240
Encino Savings and Loan.
Guard grabbed LBJ's ponytail.

402
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,920
Twenty-eight robberies.

403
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,080
And what do we get from it?
One fucking hair.

404
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,320
Angelo, pay attention.
There's gonna be a test afterward.

405
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Lab is showing traces of toxins
in the hair.

406
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,120
Selenium, titanium, arsenic.

407
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,840
The beaches are always being closed
because of waste spills, right?

408
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,680
And surfers are territorial.
They stick mostly to certain breaks.

409
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,480
If we can get some hair samples
and get a match at a certain beach...

410
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,040
...we'd know which break
the ex-presidents surf.

411
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,360
You buying this?

412
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,320
- No.
- No.

413
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,160
But let's do it anyway.

414
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,160
It will bug the shit out of Harp.

415
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,640
- My man.
- Yeah.

416
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,880
Hey, when you two are done making out,
I need to talk to you.

417
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,360
What's this?
Fucking narco entrapment or what, dude?

418
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,840
- Not exactly, dude.
- Oh, shit.

419
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,040
- Making a wig for my girlfriend. Thank you.
- What the fuck?

420
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,400
- Fucking, that was a narc, man.
- Dude out my hair.

421
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,720
- So what? He didn't bust us.
- But dude, he fucking cut my hair.

422
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,520
Bro. Bro.

423
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,720
Don't move.

424
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Got some huge sucker crawling
right into your ear.

425
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,920
- Got it. Ugh!
- Hey.

426
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,280
Leave some fucking hair, man.

427
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,480
What is it?

428
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,800
Saved your life, bro.

429
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,000
Close one.

430
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,560
PCBs, selenium, titanium, arsenic.

431
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,320
The percentages look right.

432
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,120
Here's a match.

433
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,440
- A match?
- Latigo Beach.

434
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,960
Nice point break.

435
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Long workable rides.

436
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,680
Surf's up, ace.

437
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,560
Stay off my wave.

438
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,080
Goons trying to drop in.

439
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,680
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

440
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,320
Out of the way, you shit.

441
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,200
Hey.

442
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,160
You dinged my board, kook.

443
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,520
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going?

444
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,120
Politeness counts, asshole.

445
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,720
Go back to the Valley, man.

446
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,840
Angelo, I've eaten shit 47 times...

447
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
...and got my lights punched out
by some psycho local.

448
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,080
There must be 20 guys here
with ponytails.

449
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,400
Patience, hotshot, patience.

450
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,640
It will be subtle, if it's here at all.

451
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,880
They'll be a group within the group.

452
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,480
These guys are a real tight unit.
You'll see them, you'll know it.

453
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,640
- This the guy?
- Yeah.

454
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,280
Okay.

455
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,760
I know.

456
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,160
This is where you tell me
all about how locals rule...

457
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,400
...and yuppie insects like me shouldn't
be surfing your break and all that, right?

458
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,320
Nope.

459
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,320
That would be a waste of time.

460
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,080
We're just gonna fuck you up.

461
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,960
Oh.

462
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,960
Come on, motherfucker.

463
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,160
- Eat that.
- Get him.

464
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,640
Fuck.

465
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,480
Johnny, are you there?

466
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,520
You better not be trying
to pick up any babes.

467
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,800
Again.

468
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,480
Hit him. Yeah. Harder. Yeah.

469
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,880
Back off. He's with me.

470
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,720
Kiss my ass.

471
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,640
Back off, Warchild. Seriously.

472
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,600
Thank you.

473
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,040
Stay out of this, Bodhi.

474
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,480
- What's your name?
- Bunker.

475
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,800
Bunker. Listen, Bunker,
I'm actually really glad you found me.

476
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,520
Yeah, why?

477
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,360
- Hey.
- Back off.

478
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,040
Here, man.

479
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,560
Shit.

480
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,320
Shit.

481
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
Come on. Come on.

482
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,360
Come here.

483
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,560
This is stimulating,
but we're out of here. Let's go, Utah.

484
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,400
Just keep walking.

485
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,240
Hold it. Okay.

486
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,440
You two guys seen a kid run through here
with a car stereo? He stole it from me.

487
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,560
No, but, uh, there's four guys back there
you might wanna check out.

488
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,920
Oh. Thanks, buddy.

489
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,120
- Hope you find him.
- Don't worry, I will.

490
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:05,080
You like to start shit, don't you?

491
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,080
Who are those guys?

492
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,920
Nazi assholes.

493
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,840
The guy you dropped is Bunker Weiss...

494
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,600
...the big one is Warchild,
a.k.a. Lupton Pitman.

495
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,920
And the other two... Hell, I don't know.

496
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,680
They, uh, think they're some kind
of death squad around here.

497
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,400
What's their program?

498
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,760
Brains are wired wrong.
They're into some bad shit.

499
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,920
Like what? Illegal shit?

500
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,280
Maybe, I don't know.
That's not what I'm talking about.

501
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,760
They live to get radical. They don't have
any understanding of the sea...

502
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,640
...so they'll never get
the spiritual side of it.

503
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,600
Hey, you're not gonna start chanting
or anything, are you?

504
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,040
Ha, ha. I might.

505
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,000
This is me.

506
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,280
So, uh, you still haven't figured out
what riding waves is all about, have you?

507
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,000
It's a state of mind.

508
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,680
It's that place where you lose yourself
and find yourself.

509
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,160
You don't know it yet, but you've got it.
It's right there.

510
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,280
I saw you with those guys, you're a pit bull.
They didn't back you down an inch.

511
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,440
And that is very rare in this world.

512
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,800
Well, thanks for stepping in.

513
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,000
Later. Oh, hey.

514
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm, uh, having some people over
at my house tonight if you wanna come.

515
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,760
Sure. Where?

516
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,480
- Come with Tyler. She knows.
- All right.

517
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,440
Next time you leave your piece and shield
in the oar, you stay in sight. Okay?

518
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,920
Okay, Dad.

519
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
Yeah, I need you to run a plate for me.

520
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,000
Two-Denver-four-Sam-niner-five-niner,
late '70s Jeep.

521
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,680
Screw you, punk.

522
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,040
The Jeep belongs to a Bunker Weiss.

523
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,240
My buddy. Guy's got quite a sheet.

524
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,880
Yeah. Yeah, skip all that.
Give me the greatest hits.

525
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,240
Felony possession of cocaine.
That's good.

526
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,080
Felony B&E. Three months in juvie.

527
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,040
Felony assault.

528
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,160
Postgraduate work at Chino.
Excellent. I'm loving it.

529
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,000
These guys really fit the profile.

530
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,120
I say we lay it on Harp.

531
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,760
Here comes the night shift.

532
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,800
Hey, who was that girl?

533
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,600
No, the girl with the really big tits.

534
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,720
This is bullshit. This is a bullshit lead.
This is totally bullshit.

535
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,880
Harp must be fucking desperate
if he's listening to you two flakes.

536
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,000
See you bright and early, guys.

537
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,120
Yeah, right.

538
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,040
Cold pizza for you.
It's good for breakfast. See you.

539
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,760
- When did Harp say we'd get the warrant?
- First thing.

540
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,440
You better get some sleep.
This could be an interesting morning.

541
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,600
d Refused to shine d

542
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,400
d I don't mind d

543
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,920
d I don't mind d

544
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,240
d If the mountains d

545
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,000
d Fell in the sea d

546
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,280
d Let it be d

547
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,600
d It ain't me d

548
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,320
d Got my own world to live through d

549
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,520
d And I ain't gonna copy you d

550
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,880
- Hey.
- Hey, Bodhi.

551
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,480
d Now, if a six turned out to be nine d

552
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,640
I taught him that trick.

553
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,360
I like it.

554
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,560
Watch yourself. She's a wild one.

555
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Make yourself at home.
What's mine is yours.

556
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,760
d I don't care d

557
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,760
Man, it jacks up.

558
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,760
You drop down into the pit.

559
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,800
It's 25 feet straight down...

560
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,360
...and your balls...
Man, your balls are about this big.

561
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,120
And the whole thing's fucking roaring,
right?

562
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,600
Pushing you forward
like you're a hood ornament...

563
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,640
...on a freight train or something, man.

564
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,560
Yeah, and if you lose it,
the fish will be picking you out of the coral.

565
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,520
Big-wave riding's for macho assholes
with a death wish.

566
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,160
No, it's not. It's the ultimate rush.

567
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,920
There's nothing that comes close to it.

568
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,160
Not even sex.

569
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,440
Maybe that's because
you're not doing it right, Roach.

570
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,920
Just paddling out into big surf
is a total commitment.

571
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,760
You can't just call time-out,
stroll on in to the beach...

572
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,520
...if you don't like the way
things are going.

573
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,440
So, what's the biggest? Waimea?

574
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,880
- Ridden?
- Yeah.

575
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,080
- Makaha.
- Dana Point.

576
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,680
Bell's Beach, Australia.

577
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,960
Whoa, whoa. No way Bell's
is bigger than Waimea, bro.

578
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,560
It will be next year.

579
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,720
Bodhi believes the 50-year storm
is coming next year.

580
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,280
Fifty-year storm. What's that?

581
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,120
- That's kind of a legend.
- No, it's real. It's absolutely reel.

582
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,560
Everything moves in cycles...

583
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,200
...so twice a century, the ocean
lets us know just how small we really are.

584
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,840
A winter storm comes out of Antarctica,
tearing up the Pacific...

585
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,360
...and it sends a huge swell north
2000 miles.

586
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,520
And when it hits Bell's Beach, it'll turn into
the biggest surf this planet has ever seen...

587
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,920
...and I will be there.

588
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,640
- So will I.
- Yeah!

589
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,280
If you want the ultimate, you gotta
be willing to pay the ultimate price.

590
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,000
It's not tragic to die
doing what you love.

591
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,600
It's how I wanna go.

592
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,200
I ain't gonna live to see 30.

593
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,040
There's too much testosterone here.

594
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,720
Whoo!

595
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,160
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies.

596
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,440
Hope you're not buying into this banzai
bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.

597
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,800
What are you talking about?

598
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,160
You got the kamikaze look, Johnny.
I've seen it.

599
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,880
Bodhi can smell it a mile away.

600
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,480
He'll take you to the edge.

601
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,480
Past it.

602
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,120
- Hey, Bodhi.
- Johnny has his own demons.

603
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,960
Don't you, Johnny?

604
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,360
What's going on?

605
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,720
Go.

606
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,600
Here. Time for a little stealth mission.
You up for it?

607
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,640
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's go.

608
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,120
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hey. Go.

609
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,560
- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

610
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,600
- I can barely do this in broad daylight.
- Come on.

611
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
At least
nobody's gonna see how bad you are.

612
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,560
Whoo-hoo!

613
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,480
- I don't think he's ready for this.
- No, he'll be fine.

614
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,000
Shit!

615
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,000
Shit! Oh, Shit! Fuck!

616
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,120
I gotta be fucking crazy.

617
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,240
But are you crazy enough?

618
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,760
Tyler!

619
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,520
Can't see shit out here. I'm gonna die.

620
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:53,640
Just feel what the wave is doing,
then accept its energy.

621
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,240
Get in sync, then charge with it.

622
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,440
You don't need to see.

623
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,560
Yeah. Right. Vision is highly overrated.

624
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,040
Okay, Johnny, this one's got your number
on it. Let's jam. Now paddle.

625
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,640
- Go, boy, jam.
- Shit. I'm gonna die now.

626
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,400
I'm gonna fucking die now.

627
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,960
Fuck!

628
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,680
Whoo! You're surfing, man.

629
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,440
Whoa!

630
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,480
Whoo!

631
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm fucking surfing!

632
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,440
Yeah!

633
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,880
Check it out!

634
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,280
Is this not the best feeling on earth?

635
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,640
Yeah! Whoo!!

636
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,160
Good break, Johnny.

637
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,840
All right!

638
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,000
- Yeah! Whoo!
- Ha, ha.

639
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,200
Looks like we lost somebody.

640
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:19,400
- Yeah, leave the fire for them.
- Hungry? Want something to eat?

641
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,040
You wanna get something to eat?

642
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,680
- I'm dying.
- I'm starving.

643
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,880
Where's my clothes?

644
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,360
Hey, Nate, you smell bad.

645
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,320
Nate, did you put my clothes in the bag?

646
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,160
Had enough?

647
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,840
Yeah.

648
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,800
I just wanna sit out here for a minute.

649
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,640
Look at you.

650
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:42,560
What?

651
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,880
Well, usually you have this intense sort of
scowl of concentration on your face...

652
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:53,080
...like you're doing all this
for a school project or something.

653
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:56,440
Or like you've got something driving you.

654
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,600
Look it, it's gone.

655
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,760
If I didn't know better...

656
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,240
...I'd say you looked almost happy.

657
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,640
I can't describe what I'm feeling.

658
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:18,040
You don't have to.

659
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,720
Goose bumps.

660
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,440
- Yeah, it's cold.
- Yeah.

661
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,360
Come here.

662
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,360
Holy shit.

663
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,360
- What?
- Shit.

664
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,560
I'm really late.

665
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,040
I mean, I'm really late.

666
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,680
Holy shit.

667
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,480
Shit. Oh, Shit!

668
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,040
I'm really late.

669
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,600
- Need help?
- I can't believe you're late to your own raid.

670
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,240
What a flake.

671
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,240
Has that worthless quarterback
punk partner of mine shown up?

672
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,720
Right here.

673
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,160
Well, very good of you to show up,
hotshot.

674
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,000
Watch it. You're gonna tear my skin.

675
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,240
- Goddamn it.
- I'm ready, Angelo. Where do you want me?

676
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,720
Here's how it is. Babbit and Alvarez
are gonna go in the back door.

677
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,920
Cullen's gonna back me up. I want you...

678
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,920
...at the side window by the hedge.

679
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,160
You're strictly backup.
I don't wanna burn your cover. Got that?

680
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,520
- Got it.
- Good.

681
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,520
Now take your position. It's Showtime.

682
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,560
- Go.
- Asshole.

683
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,840
Scooby?

684
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,080
Come on, Scooby.

685
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,640
Scooby, where are you?

686
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,120
- Seen a little dog?
- No, man.

687
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,040
No dog? Scooby, come on.

688
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,000
Here, Scooby.

689
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,320
Scooby.

690
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,160
Oh, yeah, baby.

691
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,360
- What the fuck?
- Get up. Someone at the front door.

692
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,320
Let's go. Get your gun now. Get it.

693
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,720
- Yeah, what?
- Oh. Uh, hi. Oh. Ha, ha.

694
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,120
Uh, have you seen my dog?
I got a little dog, a cockapoo-like thing.

695
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,560
- I don't know anything about your dog.
- Wait.

696
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,200
- He's a nice dog.
- I don't give a...

697
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,400
Cullen, this is Utah.

698
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,240
Get Angelo out.
They're pulling out a fucking arsenal.

699
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,480
Utah, repeat. Say again.

700
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,680
Cullen, you copy?

701
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,240
Cullen.

702
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,160
Alvarez.

703
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,400
Don't let him pull his badge.

704
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,000
Fuck. I can't hear jack shit
over the lawn mower. Christ.

705
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,080
Front door.

706
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,920
- Something's going down. This ain't right.
- Chill the fuck out, man. It's nothing.

707
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,400
Will you shut the fuck up?

708
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,720
Check the windows, bro, do it.

709
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,600
- Shit.
- That little bastard.

710
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,920
- Before he goes, he lifts his leg...
- I told you, I don't know anything...

711
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,240
- Hide the Shit.
- Wait, Wait, Wait.

712
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,160
- Sure it's not in the backyard?
- I ain't got time for this.

713
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,760
There's two guys out the back, man.
Duck down.

714
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:18,320
Oh, shit. Shit, we're fucked.

715
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,920
That fuck comes through the door
I'm gonna pump him up. Swear to Christ.

716
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,480
- You sure he's not in the back?
- He ain't back there.

717
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,440
- Anybody else who has seen him?
- Get the fuck out of my face.

718
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,720
FBI, gorgeous.

719
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,480
- FBI. Drop it!
- Fuck you.

720
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,760
Fucking pigs.

721
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,520
Oh, wait. Hey, no, no.

722
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,000
Goddamn. Ch, motherfucker.

723
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,640
Oh, shut up!

724
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,280
You motherfuckers!

725
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,760
- Motherfucking.. Motherfucking..
- Shut up, I said!

726
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,400
Motherfucker, back up!

727
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,960
Back up or I blow her fucking head off!

728
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:14,560
Back up or I'll take her with me.
Back up. I'm coming out right now.

729
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,240
Back up. Back up!

730
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,880
Oh, God! Let me go! Let me go!

731
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,960
God. Cullen!

732
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,960
Aah! You bastard!

733
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,560
- Fucked.
- Unh!

734
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,120
You bastard.

735
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:56,200
Come here. Come on.

736
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,760
- Babbit?
- You fuckers.

737
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,760
Oh, God.

738
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,800
Fuck you up, man.

739
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,640
Speak into the microphone, squid-brain.

740
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,080
Fuck.

741
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,240
- Give me your hand.
- Fuck you.

742
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,040
Give me your other hand.

743
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,800
Fuck.

744
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,880
Must feel good to you.

745
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,360
There you go. You okay?

746
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,320
Fuck!

747
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,680
Oh, God!

748
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,520
- No! Aah!
- May I have your, uh...'?

749
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,800
Don't touch it!

750
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,720
No!

751
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,200
Oh, God!

752
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,120
It's been paper targets up until today,
huh?

753
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,160
It's no different, Johnny.

754
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
Just a little more to clean up.

755
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,560
You did all right today.

756
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,680
You did real good.

757
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,840
Goddamn son of a bitch.

758
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,520
You're the cowboys. You're the real
cowboys, right? Batman and Robin?

759
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,320
You know what this is, huh?

760
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,240
You know what this is, punk?

761
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,600
This is two keys.

762
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,400
Uncut. Crystal meth.

763
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,680
Oh, shit.

764
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,960
Special Agent Utah,
I'd like you to meet Agent Dietz.

765
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,960
Works for the DEA.
He was working deep cover until you...

766
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,320
You think I like this hair, man, huh?

767
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,240
You think I like these clothes?

768
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,360
My wife wants me to stay at Ramada.

769
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,680
I've been working on these fuckers
for three months!

770
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,120
Three months!

771
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,920
I finally got them wanting to play
Wheel Of Fortune...

772
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,760
...so I can find out who their supplier is
and you fucking cowboys show up.

773
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,080
Nice tattoo, Dietz.

774
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,200
Oh, you like that, Pappas, huh?
Fuck you.

775
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:54,480
He has a record of your suspects'
movements for the last three months.

776
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,040
All I wanna know, smart guy...

777
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,000
...all I wanna know is now are these guys
robbing Tarzana City National Bank...

778
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,920
...on August 2nd when they were
in Fort fucking Lauderdale.

779
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,880
- Why don't you figure that out?
- It's not easy, is it, Utah?

780
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,880
You fucking jerks.

781
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,160
Oh, shit.

782
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,240
Shit.

783
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,440
This is not real, is it?

784
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,760
- He believes it. Ask Nathaniel.
- Hey.

785
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,320
Five-foot walls at Zeros. Let's go.

786
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,600
Hey, Tyler.

787
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,400
Hey, Bodhi.

788
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,760
So let's go.

789
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:29,200
- Time's a-wasting.
- Wait...

790
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,440
- Now.
- He does this.

791
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,400
Here's the set.

792
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,720
Oh, yeah.

793
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,200
Yeah!

794
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,040
Yeah, stop!

795
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,160
You all right?
You look like you saw a ghost.

796
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,360
Forget about it, kid. They're ghosts.

797
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,080
- I gotta go.
- You gotta what?

798
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,360
Listen, I forgot all about a meeting
I have this morning. A new client.

799
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,440
I gotta jam. Sorry. Really.

800
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,400
I'll call you later.

801
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,440
So I started trailing him.

802
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:53,960
Who, this Zen surf master?

803
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,520
- Bodhi, yeah. I'm on him all day, right?
- Yeah.

804
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,920
He goes here, he goes there, he goes
to Tower Records, buys some CDs.

805
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:01,880
He has lunch at Patrick's Roadhouse.

806
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,640
He goes
into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.

807
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,440
- Did he rob it?
- Cute.

808
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,200
He's inside 20 minutes.

809
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,280
The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.
They were scoping it out, right?

810
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,640
They were scoping it out
or cashing a check.

811
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,960
Wait, wait. Then they go back to their
beach house and they box up all their shit.

812
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,560
- Yeah.
- See, summer's over.

813
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,600
They load it in Bodhi's truck
and they take it to a public storage unit.

814
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:28,400
And I lost them after that.
But the house is empty.

815
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,840
- They're definitely out of here.
- Goddamn it.

816
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,880
Why didn't you call me?
They're probably halfway to Maui.

817
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,600
Uh-uh. No, they've got to pick up
some traveling money first.

818
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,240
Assured Trust tomorrow.

819
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,960
Next day outside, latest.
I definitely got a feeling on this.

820
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,280
You got a feeling. Last time
you had a feeling, I had to kill a guy.

821
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,440
And I hate that.
It looks bad on my report.

822
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,880
Angelo, I'm right this time.

823
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,720
We can still win this one.

824
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,600
Okay.

825
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,440
Tomorrow morning, first thing,
we'll be at the bank like stink on shit.

826
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,240
- This Calvin and Hobbes is funny.
- Would you like some oranges?

827
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,960
- You want some oranges?
- No.

828
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,320
- No, no, we got a lot.
- Freshly picked, sir.

829
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,880
- Dollar, sir.
- No, thanks. Good luck.

830
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:17,680
God.

831
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,200
"For his turkey cemetery."

832
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,760
Oh.

833
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,000
It's time for lunch.

834
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,920
Angelo, it's 10:30.

835
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,040
Right around that corner,
there is a sandwich shop.

836
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,200
They sell meatball sandwiches.

837
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,160
Best I've ever tasted.
Would you go get me two?

838
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,000
Come on, partner. Two.

839
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,680
Thank you.

840
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,920
Utah? Get me two.

841
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,360
- Hi. How you doing?
- Hi.

842
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:01,960
Can I have two meatball sandwiches, a tuna
on wheat, and two lemonades, please?

843
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,920
Okay, that's two meatballs,
one tuna on wheat, two lemonades.

844
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,200
That's 7.84.

845
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,880
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

846
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,760
Oh, boy.

847
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,520
God, you scared me.

848
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,920
Here.
Yours is the one that looks like a roadkill.

849
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,640
- A roadkill?
- Enjoy.

850
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,000
- Thank you very much.
- Here's your lemonade.

851
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,480
- An, thanks.
- Did you see that Lincoln pull up?

852
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:48,120
I'm so hungry I could eat the ass-end
out of a dead rhino.

853
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:50,560
I should've had you
get me three of these things.

854
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,040
What Lincoln?

855
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,120
- Goddamn. Get them.
- FBI! Freeze!

856
01:03:58,280 --> 01:03:59,840
I got him. I got him.

857
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,120
No! Go, go.

858
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,560
Freeze!

859
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,520
Holy shit.

860
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,840
- Fuck!
- Get down.

861
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,960
- Go. Now.
- Hang on.

862
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,440
Come on. Get in. Get in.

863
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,440
- Jesus Christ. Fuck.
- Go! Go!

864
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,480
- Go!
- Give me a fucking break. I am going.

865
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,960
- Where'd they go?
- I don't fucking believe this.

866
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,560
I think we're losing them.

867
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:38,600
- Stay on them. You're losing them!
- I'm not!

868
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,680
Over to the right. Over to the right.

869
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,880
Go. Go.

870
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,160
It's coming up.

871
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,640
- Punch it, punch it.
- Be cool, man.

872
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,400
- Where is he, Dick?
- He's still behind us.

873
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,480
Hang on, you guys.

874
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,800
- We're fucked!
- This car is a piece of shit.

875
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,520
- Oh, shit!
- It's okay, they're on the left.

876
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,640
I think we lost them. I Can't see them.

877
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,080
Tell me where he is!

878
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,520
Oh, fuck! Watch out!

879
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:32,320
- We got you.
- You ain't got shit.

880
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:42,360
Goddamn it. Come on, come on.

881
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,120
Okay, guys, it's emergency sanitation.

882
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,120
- Back up, buddy.
- Hey!

883
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,440
Try it. Just try it.

884
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,840
- What about the old Chevy?
- This guy down here.

885
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,680
- I got him. I got the guy.
- Take care of him, Jimmy.

886
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,680
Get away from the car. Move it.

887
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,040
- Come on, get in.
- Wait, wait, wait.

888
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,120
Don't do it, man. Don't do it.
Don't be stupid. Run!

889
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,600
Why is he taking so long?

890
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,120
Come on!

891
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,720
We gotta go. What's his problem?

892
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:45,080
- Wait a minute.
- We gotta go!

893
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,160
- Don't go!
- Come on!

894
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,000
- Let's go.
- Oh, Shit!

895
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,880
Let's go! Go!

896
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,920
Fuck!

897
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,840
Look out!

898
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,360
Hey.

899
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,000
Get the fuck out of this house!

900
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,800
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

901
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,720
Hey! Hey! Hey!

902
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,200
Oh, no! Aah!

903
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,280
Damn!

904
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:19,680
Say again, 41.

905
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:26,720
Roger that, 41.
Cal Plate 562, Sam, Ida, X-ray. Base out.

906
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,280
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

907
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,720
Johnny,
I wanna see you in my office right now.

908
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,240
Unit 23. Unit 23.
See the manager at 4650 Wilshire.

909
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,200
Roger, 23.

910
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,640
Unit 41.
Further information on suspect's vehicle?

911
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,320
I want you to know something.

912
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,320
When you shoot, you don't miss.

913
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,080
- I missed.
- No.

914
01:10:56,240 --> 01:10:58,160
I believe you're either scared...

915
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,680
...or you're getting too goddamn close
to this surfing guru buddy of yours.

916
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,440
I don't believe you're scared.

917
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,640
Hey.

918
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,160
Go home and get some rest.
You look like hammered shit.

919
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:17,680
And if I get anything
that resembles your boy, I'll beep you.

920
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:19,720
Now, go home.

921
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,120
Goddamn it.

922
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,880
So, what's the other guy look like?

923
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,080
Never saw him.
It was your basic hit-and-run.

924
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:33,840
You look like you got in a train wreck.

925
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:36,840
Stupid jerk just kept driving?

926
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,560
Ouch. Baby, I'm sorry.

927
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,600
Johnny, what is it with you?

928
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:49,440
You've got that look again.

929
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,000
That you...

930
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,040
That you're about to tell me something
and then you don't.

931
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:00,480
Or you can't.

932
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,760
There's something
I've wanted to tell you.

933
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,720
It's important.

934
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:07,520
It could really affect things
between you and me.

935
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,040
Man.

936
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,480
This is harder than I thought.

937
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,440
God, men are so bad at this.

938
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:30,440
Shh.

939
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,120
Some other time.

940
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,960
You act like nothing happened.

941
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,480
Relax, Nathanial.

942
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,960
Don't tell me to relax, Bodhi.
He's a fucking federal agent.

943
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,160
I should've shot him
when I had the chance.

944
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,360
I'll deal with that fucking Cop.

945
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,920
No, Rosie.

946
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:04,800
We have hit 30 banks in three years
and they haven't been able to touch us.

947
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,360
All this does
is up the stakes of the game.

948
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,360
Fuck the stakes, Bodhi.

949
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,720
The only person this is a game to is you,
man. This is real.

950
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,160
I mean, this is serious shit
and I am scared, okay?

951
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,800
So I say we get the fuck out of here now,
tonight, okay?

952
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,400
You run, you die.

953
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:25,320
Come on, think about it.

954
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:32,040
This was never about money for us.
It was about us against the system.

955
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,120
That system that kills the human spirit.
We stand for something.

956
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:41,280
To those dead souls inching along
the freeways in their metal coffins...

957
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:45,000
...we show them
that the human spirit is still alive.

958
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,720
So you trust me?

959
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,480
Okay.

960
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,240
Then don't worry about this guy.
I know exactly what to do with him.

961
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:24,760
A lawyer. You lied to me.

962
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,320
Tyler, put the gun down.

963
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,360
I'll bet you lied about everything.

964
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,880
I'll bet you lied about your parents.

965
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:38,480
You just tell me the truth, Johnny.

966
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,880
Did your parents die in a car accident?

967
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:45,400
Did they?

968
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,920
They live in Columbus, Ohio.

969
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:53,880
I work Bank Robbery. The guys I'm after
are surfers. I needed you at first...

970
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,800
- ...but after that I...
- Fuck you.

971
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,800
Don't you have a soul?

972
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:04,560
- Goddamn you to hell.
- Tyler...

973
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,120
Tyler, wait!

974
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,480
Tyler!

975
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,800
- Leave a message.
- Tyler, look, I fucked up, okay?

976
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,760
I know I fucked up.

977
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:21,040
I wanted to tell you but I couldn't.

978
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,320
I was afraid you'd leave.

979
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,920
Good guess, huh?

980
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,320
Fuck.
Why Can't I ever say what I really mean?

981
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:35,080
I lied to you.
I'm an asshole, but I need you, Tyler.

982
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,240
I went you to know that I've never known
anyone like you before in my life...

983
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,680
...and I hope you change your mind.

984
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,480
Tyler, wait. I'm coming.

985
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,200
Howdy, bro.

986
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,160
So come on, we're rolling.

987
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:56,440
What's going on, Bodhi?

988
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,680
Whoa, what happened?
Cut yourself shaving?

989
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,360
I don't think I wanna surf right now.

990
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,240
Surf? No, this is different, Johnny.

991
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,000
This is really different.
You are gonna love it.

992
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,720
So we gotta get your stuff
and get out of here.

993
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,080
Okay, uh, socks...

994
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,480
...shirt.

995
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,120
And then, uh, boots. Here we go.

996
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:27,160
Okay, put the stuff on in the truck.
We gotta go. Life is short.

997
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,080
You are gonna love this.

998
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,600
- Whoo!
- Yo.

999
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,240
- Finally, we're here.
- All right, let's unload.

1000
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,800
You take this bag, Grommet.

1001
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:55,480
- Come on.
- Nathaniel, wait a minute.

1002
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:59,480
- Take this too.
- Thank you, sir. There you go.

1003
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,080
Ever done this before?

1004
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,360
No, but I've seen it on TV.

1005
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,320
It's 100 percent pure adrenaline.

1006
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,640
Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it.
All you gotta do is jump.

1007
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,200
Sure, it's a blast. But listen,
I sort of screwed my knee up yesterday.

1008
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,040
Oh, yeah, I noticed you limping,
but, hey, don't worry, bro.

1009
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:18,160
Don't worry, because
we're not gonna land on land.

1010
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,680
Oh, well, fine then. I feel so much better.

1011
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,840
Okay, let's fly.

1012
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,400
Three minutes.

1013
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,480
This is a ceremony we always do at the end
of the summer. One last speed star.

1014
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1015
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:45,360
By the way, you might wanna pull
that orange thing sometime.

1016
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,600
The life you save may be your own.

1017
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,120
So, uh...

1018
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:52,920
...who packed my Chute?

1019
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,120
I did. Why? You don't trust me?

1020
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:57,560
You gotta earn trust.

1021
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,520
Okay, we'll earn it together.
Here, take mine.

1022
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,800
Hey, Johnny, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

1023
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,120
Bodhi's packs are pretty shitty.
They only open about half the time.

1024
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,600
- Less.
- Bullshit.

1025
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,560
Why don't you take young Grommet's here?
How'd that be?

1026
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:19,160
No, you don't want this one, man.
This one's set for a neck-breaker.

1027
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,160
You'd probably be better off
with something like this.

1028
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:25,920
Are we gonna jump or jerk off?

1029
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:28,200
That's my man. Ha, ha.

1030
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:31,400
- Here we go.
- Yeah, let's do it.

1031
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,120
Johnny, you're about to jump out
of a perfectly good airplane.

1032
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,280
How you feel about that?

1033
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,920
Geronimo!

1034
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,040
Shit! Whoa, Shit!

1035
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,280
Whoa!

1036
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,640
Sex with the gods!

1037
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:32,000
You can't beat this!

1038
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:38,040
This is fucking beautiful!

1039
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,760
Whoo-hoo!

1040
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,400
Whoa!

1041
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:17,840
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Ha!

1042
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,520
Come on, Johnny.

1043
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,920
That's it, Johnny. Go for it.

1044
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,440
Come on, Johnny.

1045
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,840
You can do it.

1046
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,800
Come on.

1047
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:07,200
Use your arms. Fly like an eagle, baby.
Whoo!

1048
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,280
Keep coming.

1049
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,840
All right.

1050
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,960
- Johnny, you did it.
- You're a speed star.

1051
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,480
We're going like a bat out of hell.

1052
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:22,840
Whoo-hoo!

1053
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,560
- Right.
- Right, you're a speed star.

1054
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,840
- How do you like it, Johnny?
- Amazing!

1055
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,120
Fucking amazing!

1056
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,240
This is so beautiful!

1057
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:47,480
I love this ground-rush shit!

1058
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,160
Okay. Break.

1059
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,040
Great, isn't it?

1060
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,640
You're doing good.

1061
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:16,520
A thousand feet, pull.

1062
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:19,960
After you, Alphonse. I insist.

1063
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:30,000
- Pull the ripcord now.
- You first.

1064
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,360
- Okay.
- Son of a bitch.

1065
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:22,280
Jesus Christ.

1066
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,920
I gotta be losing it.

1067
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,320
It's the closest you'll ever get to God.

1068
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,120
Like the palm of your hand.
Coming right at you.

1069
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,440
- Unbelievable.
- It's ineffable.

1070
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,320
- Indescribable.
- An experience to share.

1071
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,280
- We did pull pretty low.
- You'll never be the same again.

1072
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:48,200
- Didn't I tell you Johnny'd be just fine?
- Yeah. Damn first.

1073
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,680
Hey, Johnny,
you can drop your chute right there.

1074
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,520
Good job.

1075
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:56,360
Pack off your shoulders.
Kick it back, step out of it.

1076
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,640
- I'll pack that for you, Bodhi.
- Okay. Thanks.

1077
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:01,640
Johnny, come here.
There's something you need to see.

1078
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,320
Hop in.

1079
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,120
Okay, fucking...

1080
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,440
What's this?

1081
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:20,800
This is an insurance policy.

1082
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:25,320
It will sting a bit, but, uh, it's
for your own growth, bro. Press play.

1083
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,880
Help!

1084
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,280
Fuck you!

1085
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,080
Fuck you!

1086
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,280
She is a wild one,
isn't she, Special Agent Utah?

1087
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:16,000
You're a fucking dead man!

1088
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,960
Whoa. Whoa. Hold it, man.
Think. Think it through, man.

1089
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,000
I'm the only one that knows
where she is.

1090
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:25,480
I'm the only one, so let me talk.
Let me talk.

1091
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,400
Talk.

1092
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,360
She'll be fine. Rosie won't do anything...

1093
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,000
...as long as I meet him at a certain place
and time six hours from now.

1094
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,800
You call him right now
and tell him to let her go.

1095
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,280
Sorry, I can't do it, bro.

1096
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,640
They're on the road.
And where they're going...

1097
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:47,120
...there are no phones,
so you are shit out of luck.

1098
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,080
Oh, man.

1099
01:25:57,800 --> 01:25:59,440
I hate this, Johnny.

1100
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,560
I really do. I hate violence.

1101
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,760
See, that's why I need Rosie.
I could never do that, man.

1102
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,040
I could never hold a knife to Tyler's throat.
She was my woman.

1103
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,120
We shared time.

1104
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,560
But Rosie is a mechanism, you know?

1105
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:18,760
Once you set him in motion,
he will not stop.

1106
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,680
He's, like, got this gift of blankness.

1107
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,640
But when 3:00 comes...

1108
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:29,440
...he will gut her like a pig
and try not to get any on his shoes.

1109
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:31,960
And there's nothing I can do about it
unless I get there.

1110
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,960
So I guess that makes us partners.

1111
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,760
Because we both have the same goal.

1112
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:38,760
To get me where I need to go, right?

1113
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,360
We're wasting time.

1114
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:51,560
Oh, that's what I love about you, Johnny.
You are just as sharp as a razor.

1115
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:56,280
Murphy, take the plane down
to Santa Monica. Top off the tanks.

1116
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,920
- All right.
- Guys, it's party time. Let's move it.

1117
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:00,880
All right. We're on it.

1118
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,760
All I'm asking for is 90 seconds
of your life, Johnny. That's it.

1119
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:24,240
You see? It's a basic dog psychology.

1120
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,440
If you scare them and get them
peeing down their leg, they submit.

1121
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,600
Yet if you project weakness,
you draw aggression.

1122
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,240
That's how people get hurt.

1123
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:38,720
You see, fear causes hesitation...

1124
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,680
...and hesitation will cause your worst fears
to come true.

1125
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:44,440
So it's simple.

1126
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,520
You project strength to avoid conflict.

1127
01:27:47,680 --> 01:27:50,160
Peace through superior firepower.

1128
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,520
Oh.

1129
01:27:58,440 --> 01:27:59,920
There you go.

1130
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:03,360
Can't have you walking through those doors
with your dick in your hand, right?

1131
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,320
I can't do this.

1132
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,880
Sure you can.

1133
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,560
Who knows? You might like it.

1134
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:11,800
It's a killer rush.

1135
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,360
Bodhi,
this is your fucking wake-up call, man.

1136
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,760
I am an FBI agent.

1137
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,280
I know, man. Isn't it wild?

1138
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,080
That's what makes it great, Johnny.

1139
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:25,200
We can exist on a different plane,
we can make our own rules.

1140
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,360
Why be a servant to the law
when you can be its master?

1141
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,800
- Fucking A.
- I love this fucking job.

1142
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,400
Okay.

1143
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,120
Ninety seconds, door-to-door.

1144
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:39,400
It's a small price to pay
for someone who loves you.

1145
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:41,680
She does, you know.

1146
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,560
It's not her style to fall so hard.

1147
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:46,160
I don't think she did with me.

1148
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,720
Okay. Mr. Carter.

1149
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,080
LBJ.

1150
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,720
Mr. Nixon.

1151
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,440
Well.

1152
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:10,920
Sorry, Johnny.

1153
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:13,320
Looks like you don't get to be president.
Ha, ha.

1154
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,880
I'm ready.

1155
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,640
Rock 'n' roll.

1156
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,040
Everybody freeze!

1157
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,280
- Okay. On the floor now. Do it.
- On the floor right now.

1158
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:47,520
Hold it. Where are you going?

1159
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,640
- Everybody down!
- Okay, let's go. I got his gun.

1160
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,040
What are you doing, man?

1161
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:56,360
On the floor, asshole.

1162
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,360
What's your problem? I'll blow out your
fucking kneecaps, you'll be on the floor.

1163
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,760
A kick in the ass, ain't it, man?
Hey, look, you're on TV. Smile.

1164
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,000
- Could be little hard to play FBI now, huh?
- Can we just get the goddamn money...

1165
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,640
...and get out of here?

1166
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,520
Nobody move.

1167
01:30:13,720 --> 01:30:15,640
Heads down, eyes down.

1168
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
May I have your attention, please?

1169
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:21,080
We are the ex-presidents.

1170
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:24,400
And as you can see,
we are, in fact, robbing your bank.

1171
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:27,680
So with a little cooperation,
I won't have to blow your heads off.

1172
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:30,960
So I need just a couple of minutes
of your lives, and we're gone.

1173
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,000
Dick. Dick, go to the vault.

1174
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,640
Uh, you, Miss Jennings.

1175
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,520
Would you be a dear
and open the gate for my associate now?

1176
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:45,200
- Mr. Duggan's got the keys.
- Why are we going to the vault?

1177
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:47,240
- We never go to the vault.
- Just do it.

1178
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,200
Lyndon, go with them.
We're hitting the vault, man. Go, go.

1179
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:53,240
Who's Mr. Fucking Duggan?

1180
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:57,200
Mr. Duggan, do you wanna open the vault
or do you want me to do it?

1181
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,840
Do whatever they want, Terry.

1182
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,800
Take the fucking keys! Take them!

1183
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,280
Move it.

1184
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,040
Open the damn door!

1185
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,200
I'll fucking blow your fucking head off!
Move it!

1186
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,600
Come on, now.

1187
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,160
Get out of the way.

1188
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,640
Okay.

1189
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,720
- All right.
- Go for the back. Big bills.

1190
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,520
Fucking going in the fucking vault.

1191
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,800
- Okay.
- This is a bad idea.

1192
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,000
On the ground. Don't look at me.

1193
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,480
You're blowing it, man.

1194
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:38,200
You're breaking your own rules.
You're pulling too much time.

1195
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:39,480
Jimmy, how we doing?

1196
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:43,600
- Sixty-five. What's happening?
- Don't worry, man. It's fine. It's great.

1197
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:46,760
Fuck. Fuck.

1198
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:51,720
Hey.

1199
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,080
I'm a cop.

1200
01:31:53,240 --> 01:31:54,680
So?

1201
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:00,440
- I'm a cop.
- Oh, no. Don't.

1202
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,760
You got a gun on your ankle?

1203
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,800
- Yeah.
- When I make the move, you back me up.

1204
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,840
- Please don't. Don't. You don't have to.
- You back me up.

1205
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:12,880
No. Don't do it. Don't do anything.

1206
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:15,080
Oh, no, don't, don't.

1207
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:16,760
Just put it away.

1208
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,480
Please, put it away. Put it away.

1209
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,280
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go. We gotta go. Let's go.

1210
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,200
Fucking move.

1211
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:34,400
Federal agent. Undercover.

1212
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,240
Nobody fucking move!

1213
01:33:32,680 --> 01:33:34,160
Are you all right?

1214
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:38,440
Hang on. Hang on, little brother. Come on.
We're out of here. We are out of here.

1215
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,960
Hang on. Okay, I'll get you out of here.

1216
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,280
- Hang on, little brother. Just hang on, man.
- Help me, Bodhi.

1217
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,720
No, please. No.

1218
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,760
Are you out of your fucking mind?

1219
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,880
What's the matter with you? Is that what
you want? Did you get what you wanted?

1220
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,080
Come on, you can't take him with.
Let's go!

1221
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,200
Goddamn it. Who's in charge of this
camera crew? This is a crime scene.

1222
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,360
- Get them the fuck out of here.
- Come on. Out.

1223
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:47,280
You have the right to remain silent.

1224
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,600
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1225
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:54,600
If you so desire, an attorney
will be provided for you free of cost.

1226
01:34:54,760 --> 01:34:58,080
Now, do you understand these rights
I've just given you, Utah?

1227
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:01,600
Do you understand? Understand the rights
I've just read you, Utah?

1228
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,640
Hey.
He understands his goddamn rights.

1229
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,480
Jesus Christ, kid, are you okay?
Stand up. Get these cuffs off.

1230
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:07,880
- Leave the cuffs on.
- Off.

1231
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,280
- Leave them on!
- Oh, boy.

1232
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,600
Your partner's an accessory to murder,
understand?

1233
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,400
Utah, there are three dead people,
one's a police officer.

1234
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,080
Let me show you something, pal.

1235
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:21,760
- How does that sit in your stomach, huh?
- Take your hands off me right now.

1236
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:22,960
Harp. Harp.

1237
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:25,320
Listen. Look at me. Look at me.

1238
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:29,520
Don't send him in with the black and whites
like some punk. Let me ride him in.

1239
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,160
Yeah, sure, Angelo, why not?

1240
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:33,400
That's why
I put you two screw-ups together.

1241
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:36,520
You deserve each other, don't you?
You're just as bad as he is.

1242
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:39,400
Only you're a little fatter, slower,
and more pathetic.

1243
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,400
It's like the blind leading the blind.

1244
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,520
Harp, I wanna tell you something.

1245
01:35:44,680 --> 01:35:48,480
I was in this bureau when you were
still popping zits on your funny face...

1246
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,000
...and jacking off to the lingerie section
of the Sears catalog.

1247
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,160
- Is that right, Pappas?
- Yes, that's right, Harp.

1248
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:58,560
And there's one thing that I learned out
of all these years that you still haven't got.

1249
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,720
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you astonish me, shitface?

1250
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,880
Respect for my elders.

1251
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,080
God. Jesus.

1252
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,200
Plain and simple. Come on, kid. Let's go.

1253
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:12,640
- Holy shit.
- Let's get out of here.

1254
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,440
Go, please.

1255
01:36:20,360 --> 01:36:22,280
I know where they're going.

1256
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:25,200
I figured you did.

1257
01:36:26,480 --> 01:36:28,840
Santa Monica Airport, fast.

1258
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
- But we've got one minor problem.
- What?

1259
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,400
We can't arrest them or shoot them.

1260
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:36,120
What?

1261
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,800
- Did you set this altimeter?
- One thousand.

1262
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,480
- What?
- One thousand.

1263
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,880
Check the rigging, okay?

1264
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1265
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,640
Fucking FBI.

1266
01:37:19,120 --> 01:37:20,760
I'm not armed.

1267
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:29,480
- But you're not alone.
- Good guess.

1268
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,680
There's a gun on you right now.

1269
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:44,240
- Where's Roach?
- He's around somewhere.

1270
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,080
So listen, Johnny, we are
in kind of a hurry. What do you need?

1271
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,280
You gotta tell me where she is.

1272
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,800
Oh, and let my policy expire. Good idea.

1273
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:57,120
Look, Bodhi, man, people are dead.
The ride is over.

1274
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,320
Oh, no, no. I say when it's over.

1275
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,800
The guy you killed was an off-duty cop.

1276
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,800
They'll nail you wherever you land.

1277
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,040
There's a new thing called radar.
Maybe you've heard of it.

1278
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:11,800
What is your...?

1279
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:14,080
Nathaniel, get in there.

1280
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,480
- Get back in the cockpit. Move.
- Yeah.

1281
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,720
I know you, man.

1282
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,120
When they fall on you,
you won't back down.

1283
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,160
They'll have to burn your ass
to the ground.

1284
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,520
Uh-huh. And shit happens.

1285
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:35,000
Look, you got a death wish.
You wanna ride to glory, fine.

1286
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,520
But don't take Tyler with you.

1287
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,720
I'm begging you.

1288
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,800
Tell me where she is, then I walk away.

1289
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:45,080
- You walk away?
- I walk away.

1290
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,520
That is beautiful, Johnny.

1291
01:39:03,720 --> 01:39:05,000
Angelo, don't fire!

1292
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:08,240
They'll kill her! NO!

1293
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:10,920
Get out of the way, kid. Goddamn it.

1294
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,480
Damn.

1295
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,880
No!

1296
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,400
Jesus Christ.

1297
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,080
- Angelo.
- I don't have much...

1298
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,440
- Come on, man, just hang on.
- I'm really fucked up.

1299
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,360
Just hang on. You'll be all right.

1300
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:18,400
- I'm not flying you guys to San Felipe.
- Get in the plane. Start those engines.

1301
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,520
Oh, good. Tell him where we're going.

1302
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:25,400
Let's go, man.

1303
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:30,480
We are gonna ride this all the way, Johnny,
you and me. So let's go.

1304
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:34,960
Get the fuck up! Tyler's waiting!

1305
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,880
Start the engines now!

1306
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:42,800
Go!

1307
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:57,200
Go, go, go, go, go.

1308
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:30,920
Rosie? Yo, Rosie, this is Air Force One.
Do you read me? Do you read me? Over.

1309
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:33,880
Look, man, we've been over Mexico
for the last half hour.

1310
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:36,040
Can I quit mowing the lawn here?

1311
01:41:36,200 --> 01:41:38,480
Getting more bushes in the wheels
than I like.

1312
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:42,520
Shut your mouth and take it to 4000 feet
on this heading, all right?

1313
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,120
- All right.
- I don't think that's a good idea, man.

1314
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:48,880
We'll pop up on their screens.

1315
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:53,880
It doesn't matter. We're almost there.
Just gotta get you to a safe jump altitude.

1316
01:41:54,080 --> 01:41:56,360
Hey, let's get your rig on.

1317
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,360
Hey, man, I'm cold. I'm really cold.

1318
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:04,960
All right, your jacket.
Here's your jacket. Easy.

1319
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:08,560
Oh, fuck.

1320
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:10,560
I know, I know, I know.

1321
01:42:10,720 --> 01:42:13,920
- Easy. Easy. One arm at a time.
- I can't get it. I can't get it.

1322
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,800
No, man. No, don't, don't, don't.

1323
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,080
Johnny...

1324
01:42:23,440 --> 01:42:25,080
...throw me that money bag.

1325
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,320
Now.

1326
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,120
You're cold because blood
is running out of your body, Roach.

1327
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,480
You're going to be dead soon.

1328
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,200
I hope it was worth it.

1329
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,080
Don't listen to him, he's just scared.

1330
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:46,520
You just keep thinking
about all those senoritas and margaritas...

1331
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,200
...that are gonna be nursing you back
to health, okay?

1332
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,760
What the fuck are you looking at?

1333
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,120
Fuck.

1334
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:59,760
- Okay. Okay.
- There you go.

1335
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,280
Rosie.

1336
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,960
Rosie, this is Air Force One.
Do you copy? Do you copy? Over.

1337
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,440
Copy. We have a visual on you.

1338
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:19,880
Tell him to release Tyler.

1339
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:25,280
Do it. Do it now.

1340
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:27,720
You won, you got what you wanted.

1341
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:31,160
What if your Chute fails?
Cancel the order.

1342
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:36,000
She's served her purpose. Do it, man.
You owe me that much.

1343
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,120
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah.

1344
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,840
On three. One, two, three.

1345
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:51,040
Easy. Come on, a little more.

1346
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:54,640
- Get your Chute clear. Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1347
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:56,920
Easy, easy.

1348
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,200
Okay.

1349
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,920
- I'll see you on the ground, all right?
- All right.

1350
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,120
I'll see you in hell, Johnny.

1351
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:13,320
I know it's hard for you, Johnny.

1352
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:16,400
I know you want me so bad,
it's like acid in your mouth...

1353
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,840
...but not this time.

1354
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,400
Adios, amigo.

1355
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,040
Fucked.

1356
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,880
- Unh! What?
- Pull the chute, Bodhi.

1357
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,600
- You are crazy.
- Pull the fucking Chute!

1358
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:37,960
Why don't you pull it?

1359
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,920
No games, Bodhi. Pull the cord now.

1360
01:45:41,080 --> 01:45:43,200
No, you pull it.

1361
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,240
Go ahead, Johnny, pull it.
You gotta drop the gun, right?

1362
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:49,840
You use your other hand,
what are you gonna hold on with?

1363
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,080
Pull it right now, or I blow
your fucking head off and pull it myself!

1364
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:57,600
- It's the only way it's gonna happen. Do it.
- Swear to God, I will!

1365
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,640
Do it, man. Do it
or you're gonna die, Johnny!

1366
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:04,520
Six seconds,
we're gonna be meat waffles.

1367
01:46:04,680 --> 01:46:06,680
Five, four...

1368
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,360
- You're fucking Crazy. Pull it! Pull it!
- ...three, two...

1369
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:12,640
- ...one.
- Shit!

1370
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,760
Shit!

1371
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:02,040
Jesus Christ, Bodhi.

1372
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:08,480
Goddamn,
you are one radical son of a bitch.

1373
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,240
I'm out of here, Johnny.

1374
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:42,280
That knee again, huh?

1375
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,200
Too bad. Looks like this time,
you won't be getting your man.

1376
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,640
This game, we both lose.

1377
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:09,800
Let her go.

1378
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,520
Let her go.

1379
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:41,400
- Johnny, I...
- Shh.

1380
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,080
Some other time.

1381
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:55,440
Come on, we're out of here.

1382
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:02,760
Yo, Johnny!

1383
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,400
I'll see you in the next life.

1384
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:33,560
We can't leave him. We gotta bury him.

1385
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:35,320
There's no time, man.

1386
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:02,560
The cyclone warning
is current for coastal areas...

1387
01:50:02,720 --> 01:50:04,400
...between Torquay and Cape Otway.

1388
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,760
Experts are saying this is potentially one
of the worst storms in Australia's history.

1389
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:11,720
Heavy reins will continue into the night
with destructive winds...

1390
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,440
...reaching up to 150 kilometers
per hour.

1391
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:17,360
The center of the cyclone
is now expected to cross the coast...

1392
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,680
...between Bell's Beach and Bay Haven
early tomorrow morning.

1393
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,320
Residents are advised
to prepare for evacuation.

1394
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:47,040
What do you wanna do now?

1395
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:50,880
- I wanna get out of this mess.
- I'm freezing.

1396
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:59,280
- Sorry, mate.
- Anybody been out there?

1397
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,400
No one's been out
and no one's going out.

1398
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:06,200
You gotta be fucking crazy, man.
Death on a stick out there, mate.

1399
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,400
Wiping me out, man.

1400
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,120
Lose something, bro?

1401
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:01,800
Special Agent Utah.
I knew I could count on you.

1402
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,120
I've been to every city in Mexico.

1403
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:11,560
Came across an unclaimed piece of meat
in Baja, turned out to be Rosie.

1404
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,880
Guess he picked a knife fight
with somebody better.

1405
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:19,720
Found a passport of yours in Sumatra,
missed you by about a week in Fiji.

1406
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:25,000
But I knew you wouldn't miss
the 50-year storm, Bodhi.

1407
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,200
Yeah.

1408
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,520
Too bad.

1409
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:37,400
You finally get your waves
and it's totally closed out.

1410
01:52:37,680 --> 01:52:39,880
Just waiting for my set.

1411
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:44,120
You gotta go down.

1412
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:48,000
You crossed the line
and people trusted you and they died.

1413
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:52,400
Yeah, it went bad, went real bad.

1414
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:56,560
Life sure has a sick sense of humor,
doesn't it?

1415
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:59,800
Still surfing?

1416
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,680
Every day.

1417
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:07,320
Come on, Bodhi.

1418
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,280
It's time to go.

1419
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,920
You know you gotta go back with me.

1420
01:53:16,280 --> 01:53:18,280
Sorry, my friend.

1421
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:24,520
Come on.

1422
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:39,440
Shit.

1423
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,480
No! No!

1424
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,240
I told them...

1425
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:49,440
...you'd go quietly.

1426
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,520
No!

1427
01:54:57,240 --> 01:54:59,800
You know there's no way
I can handle a cage, man.

1428
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:03,040
I don't care. You gotta go down.

1429
01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:06,160
It's gotta be that way.

1430
01:55:15,720 --> 01:55:17,400
- Fellows, with me.
- Yes, sir.

1431
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:20,400
You handle the left side.

1432
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,600
Okay, man. Okay.

1433
01:55:30,680 --> 01:55:32,600
I'm screwed.

1434
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:38,360
I'm gonna go to jail and I'll pay,
and Johnny Utah gets his guy. Right?

1435
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:41,280
Good for you. That's real good.

1436
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,240
You're gonna be a big hero now.

1437
01:55:45,360 --> 01:55:48,280
But look at it, Johnny. Look at it.

1438
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:51,200
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,
man.

1439
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:54,360
Just let me go out there,
let me get one wave before you take me.

1440
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,520
One wave.

1441
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:59,000
Now, where am I gonna go, man?

1442
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:03,400
Cliffs on both sides.
I'm not gonna paddle to New Zealand.

1443
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:09,200
My whole life has been about this moment,
Johnny.

1444
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,080
Come on, compadre.

1445
01:56:15,800 --> 01:56:17,360
Come on.

1446
01:56:23,720 --> 01:56:26,000
- Here, this way.
- Come on!

1447
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:18,080
What the fuck, Utah?

1448
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:20,960
- What do you think you're doing?
- You let him go.

1449
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,520
No, I didn't.

1450
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,560
No way.

1451
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,800
Hey, the guy's nuts.

1452
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:45,320
Damn.

1453
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:48,280
We'll get him when he comes back in.

1454
01:57:49,160 --> 01:57:51,640
He's not coming back.
