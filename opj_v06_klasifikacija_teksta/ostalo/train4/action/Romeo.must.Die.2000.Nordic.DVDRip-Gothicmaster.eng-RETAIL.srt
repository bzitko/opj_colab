1
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,100
"Amazing Grace.”

2
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Excuse me?

3
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,300
My grandmother sang that song to me.

4
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,500
That’s real nice.

5
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,800
I especially like the part that goes:

6
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,600
"I once was lost, but now Im found".

7
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,900
Take you, for instance. You must be
a fool to roll up in here, man.

8
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,300
But I figure you must be lost.

9
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,400
So I tell you what. See this here?
This is for your bill.

10
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
And...

11
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,700
...since you look like
such a jovial individual...

12
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,800
...here’s the tip.

13
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,700
"Find" your ass out of here.

14
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,300
We haven’t finished our drinks.

15
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,700
You finished now?

16
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,500
Let it go, Po.

17
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,700
This is a hassle we don’t need.

18
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,700
And don’t come back, zipperhead.

19
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
Po, get them out of here!

20
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
Now.

21
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Let’s go.

22
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
Guess you want to gamble
with your life.

23
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,300
Casinos as good a place as any.

24
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,600
Guess I could use a little exercise.

25
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,800
Guns don’t kill people.

26
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,500
People kill people.

27
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,700
For example,
these two guys with the machine guns.

28
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,700
If they start blasting off...

29
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,100
...ain’t none of yaall going home!

30
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,100
You guys are disturbing my business.
So if your ass ain’t black...

31
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,500
...you’d better get up out of here
before it really get hot!

32
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,600
Let’s go.

33
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Ladies, excuse us.

34
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
- What are you doing, Kai?
- Get them out.

35
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,400
- You too.
- No. Stay.

36
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
You too, please.

37
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
What were you doing?
Were in a damn war.

38
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,900
Im a big boy now.

39
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,000
These black guys’ll bury you.

40
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,500
You work for me, Kai.

41
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,800
I work for your father.

42
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Get your head out of your ass, Po.

43
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,400
As long as there’s a war going on,
youre my responsibility.

44
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I can take care of myself.

45
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,400
Oh, my God.

46
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200
Tiger, you killing me, man.
I hate this game.

47
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Isaak!

48
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,600
You have a phone call.

49
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,300
I’ll take it in the house.

50
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,500
I need a break anyway.

51
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,200
I don’t even know why
you are stressing it, man.

52
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You know why Im stressing.
All future business deals...

53
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,600
...will take place not in the pool
hall, but in somebody’s country club.

54
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,100
You know that.

55
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
If youre serious
about going straight...

56
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,300
...I want to know if you got a plan
for old Mac.

57
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,900
Or should I start looking at the
classifieds?

58
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,700
As long as Im breathing...

59
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,900
...you ain’t ever got to worry about
no classifieds.

60
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Come on, boy.

61
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,300
You know it’s me and you.

62
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,100
Hey, what you got for me?

63
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,900
You sure about that?

64
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,200
Whats wrong?

65
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,300
Whats wrong, man?

66
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,700
Somebody canceled Chuss boy.

67
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,400
You set up a meeting with Chu ASAP,
then find out who killed his boy.

68
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,500
Don’t even sweat it, okay?
I got it.

69
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Mr. ODay.

70
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,200
Mr. Sings at gate B-12.

71
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,600
Thank you.

72
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,700
Nice touch on the metal detectors.

73
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
Keeps everybody honest, my man.

74
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,300
You have my deepest condolences.

75
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,900
Thank you.

76
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,400
What happened to your son
was tragic.

77
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Very unnecessary.

78
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,700
I want you to know I’ll be
looking into this personally.

79
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,300
You will forgive me
if Im not easily moved.

80
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,900
Mr. Sing...

81
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,000
...with all due respect,
there is no way...

82
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,900
...anybody in my camp would touch
your family...

83
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,500
...any more than anybody in your camp
would touch mine.

84
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,000
It just wouldn’t happen.

85
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,800
Our business venture will continue.

86
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,200
Im pleased to hear that.

87
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,100
Make sure we got 24-hour security
for my son and daughter.

88
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,100
It’s all been arranged, chief.

89
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Make those lemon tarts for the kids.

90
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,100
I need to get a signature from you.

91
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,700
Thanks.

92
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,600
- Youre welcome.
- Excuse me.

93
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,400
- Do you have this in a small?
- One minute. Amy.

94
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Help her out for me.
Shell help you.

95
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,900
- What are yall doing?
- You got a little something-something?

96
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,600
Girl, tell him to turn up the music.

97
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Show them how we used to do it.

98
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,300
Watch the store for me, okay?

99
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,800
Oh, shit.

100
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,900
What a name for a store:
Serpentine Fire.

101
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
That’s tight. It’s real tight.

102
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,300
Kool and the Gang jam
from back in the day.

103
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
Earth, Wind and Fire.

104
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,300
That serious shit.

105
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,700
Do I know you?

106
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,900
How you gonna play me like that?

107
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,300
I work for your pops.

108
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,300
- Right. Your name starts with an "M. "
- That’s it.

109
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,700
Moron.

110
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,000
Funny. It’s Maurice, all right?

111
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,300
Maurice, I’d love to reminisce
with you, but Im busy right now...

112
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,300
...so let’s do this later, okay?

113
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,800
- It don’t work like that.
- Excuse me?

114
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,200
Your father could be
catching some static...

115
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
...and Mac wants me
to watch your back.

116
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
I’ll tell you something.

117
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,100
Whatever my father and Mac are into
has nothing to do with me.

118
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,100
You can hate them all you want.
That’s your business.

119
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,900
If they say not to let you out of
my sight, you can go to confession...

120
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,300
...and it’s going to be you,
me and the priest.

121
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,500
That’s ridiculous.

122
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Look. My rides right over there.

123
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,500
Back seat or the trunk.
Make it easy on yourself.

124
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
Your choice, baby girl.

125
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,300
Waiting for the magic word.

126
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,600
Please?

127
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Stuck-up.

128
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,100
I got some coloring books
in the back.

129
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,100
- You think youre funny.
- I’m babysitting.

130
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,200
I gotta bring something
for the kids.

131
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,700
Can I get my leg in the car? Damn!

132
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,800
Damn!

133
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,800
The NFL announced Friday
that Oakland...

134
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,600
...will become home
to its newest expansion team.

135
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,000
The question of who the new owners
will be is still unresolved.

136
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,300
For more we go to Jody Vance.

137
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,700
That’s right, Perry.

138
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,400
Several groups of investors will be
presenting proposals this week.

139
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,100
I thought we were done with football
when the Raiders left town.

140
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,700
- Yeah, well, jobs.
- What?

141
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,600
Jobs. See, if they have to build
another stadium...

142
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,800
...some of us that have been less
fortunate can attain jobs.

143
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,200
Harold, your unfortunate ass been
sitting in that chair for 15 years.

144
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,300
You couldn’t attain a job if one
bit you in the butt.

145
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
You think youre funny.

146
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,800
Got a package for you.

147
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,900
Im laughing because
you think youre funny.

148
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,600
Thanks.

149
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,000
You want a job, Harold?
Open this damn box.

150
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,700
Well, lookie, lookie.

151
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Who sent you a present?

152
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,800
I don’t know.
Probably your wife.

153
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,300
There you go again.

154
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
Thank you.

155
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,900
- Excuse me.
- Off duty.

156
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,200
Can you take me here?

157
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,500
Can’t you understand English?

158
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,100
Two words: off duty.

159
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How you doing?

160
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,400
How you doing?!

161
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,400
This shit tight, huh?

162
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,600
This shits tight.
Girl, whats your name?

163
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,300
I said, whats your name?!

164
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,400
What? You don’t like a big man?
You not knowing.

165
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,000
- Whats up, Alonso?
- Trish, whats up?

166
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,000
- Just chilling. Getting some albums.
- That’s it today?

167
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,100
- You want this on your tab?
- Yeah, please.

168
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,300
Thank you.

169
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,200
This is my shit!

170
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
Shit!

171
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,800
This is my shit right here!
I got something for you right now.

172
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,000
My bad.

173
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,800
Shit!

174
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,400
Thank goodness. Just drive.

175
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,200
Two words: off duty.

176
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You know what?

177
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
Jesus.

178
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,700
Two words for you, buddy:
on duty, 50 bucks.

179
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,400
Im gonna find you!
I know where you work at!

180
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,300
Please, just do me a favor
and get me out of here.

181
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Who’s that?

182
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,000
Nobody.

183
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,400
Where did you learn to drive?

184
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,600
Ahkbar?

185
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Hong Kong.

186
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,200
You gonna start the meter?

187
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,200
Stole a lot of cabs
in Hong Kong?

188
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,800
Want me to pull over?

189
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,200
No, no. Just turn here.

190
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,700
So, Ahkbar, tell me. Is it true what
they say about Hong Kong?

191
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,600
Whats that?

192
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,100
All you guys do kung fu.

193
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,400
Of course.

194
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
State law.

195
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,500
Can you break a board with your head?

196
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,800
Sure.

197
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,500
That I’d have to see.
You must be a very dangerous man.

198
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Are you scared?

199
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,800
Don’t take this personal...

200
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,200
...but I’ve been around more
dangerous guys than you.

201
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,900
Right here’s fine.

202
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,600
No charge.

203
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,500
Keep it. I won’t call the cops.

204
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,200
I don’t want your money.

205
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,600
You seem like a nice guy.

206
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,600
I am.

207
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,600
You should find a new profession.
Stealing cars doesn’t fit you.

208
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,100
Whats your name?

209
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,600
You think I want you calling me?

210
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I don’t have a phone.

211
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Yeah? Well, dead giveaway.

212
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,300
Besides, you drive like shit.

213
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
How are those acquisitions
coming along?

214
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,800
Progressing real nice, man.

215
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,200
I just have three more deeds
to get signed over.

216
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,400
Let me be clear.
You don’t play around with the NFL.

217
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,200
It’s their America, and their deadline
is progressing in less than a week.

218
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,500
I know.

219
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,900
Remember something, Mr. Roth.

220
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,500
They’ve owned them stores
for over 30 years.

221
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,400
So what if they need a couple more
days to mull over their decision?

222
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,800
These are tense times right now.
You know what I mean?

223
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,200
Shit.

224
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Youre murdering yourself.

225
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,800
Golf is a game of finesse,
not power.

226
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,800
In that way,
it’s much like the rest of life.

227
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,700
The key is letting the body
work together.

228
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,800
Get a good shoulder turn
so the wrist breaks naturally.

229
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,000
Make sure you keep your eyes
on the ball.

230
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,800
This shaft, I don’t like it.
It ain’t working for me.

231
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,000
Save the excuses.

232
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,000
With all respect to the shop owners,
without the deeds, there’s no deal.

233
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,200
Without the land deal, there’s no
presentation. So there’s no...

234
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,400
- Whats the popular term these days?
- Cheddar.

235
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,800
That’s right. No cheddar.

236
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,000
Do I make myself clear?

237
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,400
If I say I´ll deliver, I´ll deliver.

238
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Hey, hey, hey, now.
Sorry Im late.

239
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,900
Girl, knowing the way you shop,
I’d say youre early.

240
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,000
Oh, really?
I got some hot stuff.

241
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,300
Good. Work it out!
Your brothers in the back.

242
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,600
That guy that got whacked.

243
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,500
You mean Chuss boy?

244
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,800
He called me. Ain’t that some shit?
Same night he got killed, Pop.

245
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
Jesus Christ.

246
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,100
What’d he want, Colin?

247
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,200
I don’t know. Oh, look, man.

248
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,000
Ill holler back at you later.

249
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
You be in my office in one hour.

250
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
I asked you not to do business here.

251
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,000
- Hi, sis. Nice to see you too.
- I mean it, Colin.

252
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,100
This is my place, okay?
I got kids hanging here all the time.

253
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,900
- If this is what youre about-
- Don’t start with that speech.

254
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,700
For once, let’s not go there.

255
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,700
I was talking to Pop.

256
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,600
Look, come on. Hes a businessman.
I work for this businessman.

257
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,100
Stop tripping over this shit.

258
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Colin, wait.

259
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,700
Look. Im sorry.

260
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,500
I just worry about you.

261
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,100
That’s all.

262
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,200
Yeah, I know.

263
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,600
And I love you too, Trish.

264
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,400
But you ain’t gotta worry about me.

265
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,000
Im fine.

266
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,900
Serpentine Fire.

267
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,200
Right there, baby.

268
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
Whats good?

269
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,600
Try the parking lot.

270
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,400
Im just trying to do my job, Trish.
Just like Mo.

271
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,400
He told me the shit you pulled.

272
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,400
Plain stupid is what it was.

273
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,200
Things will get tense now that
that Chinese dude got popped.

274
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,300
Was that one of your jobs too?

275
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,600
No, that shoddy works not my style.

276
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,300
Im sorry. Poor baby!
Have I got you all wrong?

277
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,000
You have no clue to what Im about.

278
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,700
Why don’t you tell me?

279
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
For starters,
get past the façade.

280
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,600
You got some serious
façade going on.

281
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,000
Well, so do you.
So does everybody.

282
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,300
And this Miss I-don’t-need-nobody
isn’t you. Not the real you.

283
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,400
- You saving yourself for Kobe Bryant?
- Is that what you think Im doing?

284
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,000
I think you need to consider
the possibility that you’ve met him.

285
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,600
Youre an errand boy for my father.
You’re nothing.

286
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,800
Fair enough.

287
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,600
But there comes a time when a man
has to strike out on his own.

288
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,500
Stake his own claim.

289
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
How did I miss it?

290
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,700
I think Im hopelessly in love
with you.

291
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,400
Make fun all you like.
Soon I’ll be way too much for you.

292
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,700
Those big brown eyes will get all
misty wishing there were two of me.

293
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
Fill yourself all you want.
I just lost my appetite.

294
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,800
Sit down.

295
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Don’t respect me, but respect
your father and let us protect you.

296
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,200
Do you understand?

297
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,200
Do you understand?!

298
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,200
Mac, youre so smooth
with the ladies, baby.

299
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,500
If I want Eddie Murphy,
I’ll go to the goddamn movies.

300
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,700
Yeah, dog.

301
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,500
Good. Give him some fat-free water
or something.

302
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,800
Where my drink, man?!

303
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,000
The fuck you looking at?

304
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,700
All the way down the end there!

305
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Finish telling me
about this call you got.

306
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,300
Guy calls,
says he wants to meet me.

307
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
For what?

308
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,600
I don’t know.
We didn’t talk that long.

309
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,300
Said he had a little something
that might put a stop to this war.

310
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,200
A little something?

311
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,200
I didn’t trust him,
so I tell him meet me at Silk’s.

312
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,300
As soon as you got that call,
you should’ve told me.

313
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,600
Next time I cross the street,
you should hold my hand.

314
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,100
Hey, who the hell you talking to?
I will knock the black off you, boy.

315
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,500
I mean no disrespect.

316
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,400
But Im just trying to be a man here.
I’m looking out for you.

317
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,200
I don’t need you
to look out for me, Colin.

318
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,200
Have a seat.

319
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,400
Go on. Sit down.

320
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,200
Come on.

321
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I’ve been working on a big deal.
A real big deal.

322
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,400
When it goes through, were out
of this gangster nonsense for good.

323
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,800
Everything we do will be
strictly legit from here on out.

324
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,700
What do you mean?

325
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I got something else lined up
for my boy.

326
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,300
You will get to run with this ball.
I guarantee that.

327
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,300
But you gotta use your head.

328
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,800
And you gotta listen.

329
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,800
You understand what Im saying?

330
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,500
Yeah, Pop.

331
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,100
Finish your drink.

332
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,900
Collard Green.

333
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,500
Black Mac.

334
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,500
Something wrong?

335
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,900
You tell me.

336
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
Hey, chief.

337
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,900
Hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but you need to see this.

338
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,000
Calvins place?

339
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
He was the sweetest guy in the world.

340
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:41,100
I think I’d better wrap up
these acquisitions quickly for you.

341
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,400
Things are getting pretty crazy
around here.

342
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,300
You gonna be okay?

343
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,200
Just give me a minute.

344
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,200
Okay, boss.

345
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,100
That’s it right over there.

346
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,500
Okay. Lock up the store.

347
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,100
- Were going out tonight?
- Definitely.

348
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,000
Follow her.

349
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,900
Ahkbar. What the hell
are you doing here?

350
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,200
I need to ask you-

351
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,500
You get out of my apartment
before I call the cops.

352
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,500
Please.

353
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,400
Youre the only guy I know working
down the criminal ladder. What’s up?

354
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,300
This is the last number my brother
called before he was murdered.

355
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,400
It’s the number of your shop.

356
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,500
It is.

357
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,000
But I don’t know your brother.

358
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,300
- Why would he want to talk to me?
- He called your store.

359
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,000
But not to talk to me.

360
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,800
A girl who works the register.
It could’ve been her.

361
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,900
My brother-

362
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,200
Brother?

363
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,800
Colin.

364
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,800
Sometimes he makes calls from the shop.
Mostly when Im not around.

365
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,000
Could you talk to him?

366
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,900
That’s Maurice and his gang.
Look, Ahkbar.

367
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,800
- I think its
- By the way, my name is Han.

368
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,300
Well, Han, look.

369
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,900
They find you, you’ll have serious
problems. Go out the window.

370
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,900
No. I like this way.

371
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,200
It’s your funeral.

372
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,600
Dim sum good. You call again.
Dim sum all time. Thanks.

373
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,400
What you doing bothering
Miss ODay?

374
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,100
Hes the delivery boy, moron.

375
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,900
I done told you,
my name is Maurice, all right?

376
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,500
Im sorry.
I keep forgetting, boo.

377
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,600
Hey, dog.

378
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,900
- You smell something?
- I don’t smell nothing.

379
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,300
- Where’s the take-out?
- You hungry, baby?

380
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,100
Cover the front.

381
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,900
Hey, Dim Sum!

382
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,500
You’s a real funny man!

383
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,800
Mr. ODay don’t let things
slide lightly.

384
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,900
He also don’t like the wrong element
around his daughter.

385
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,100
It’s up to me not to let it happen.

386
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,500
Kick his ass.

387
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,100
You ain’t the only one
that knows some shit.

388
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,500
Get up! Get him!

389
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,400
Hes headed around the front!

390
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,300
Who that motherfucker?

391
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,900
Great country.

392
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
Free cars.

393
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,300
Sun Tzu was lost to us by
assassination less than a month ago.

394
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,300
A grocery store was firebombed
and his wife killed.

395
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,900
With all respect, Chu, any of us
could be killed at any time...

396
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:09,100
...overlord or not.

397
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
We are not the blacks, Victor.

398
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,100
Our loyalty to each other
is unquestioned.

399
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,400
At least let us strike harder.
Show our true strength.

400
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,100
We will only do that
when it serves us best.

401
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,900
Let Kai worry about this.

402
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,100
Han, I don’t want to lose another son.

403
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,000
He didn’t think you’d make it.

404
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,100
And you?

405
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,200
I knew you would.

406
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,300
It’s been a long time, Han.
Good to see you.

407
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,600
Tell me...

408
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,800
...what happened that night?

409
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,600
He got in a fight in a black club.

410
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,700
Threats had been made. They got Po
that night, before I could find him.

411
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,800
Why there?

412
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,300
He wouldn’t tell me.

413
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
Your brother was a loose cannon,
but he didn’t deserve this.

414
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,000
Why fight with blacks?

415
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,300
Well, the waterfronts only
four square miles.

416
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,900
Half the businesses belong to us...

417
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,900
...the other half to them.

418
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,800
It was just a matter of time.

419
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,300
I was afraid prison would
make you soft.

420
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,500
People don’t get soft in prison.

421
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Pretty good.

422
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,300
- Here you go.
- Thank you so much.

423
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,600
You must be hungry.

424
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,700
Could you find something
better to do than creep up on me?

425
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,700
And besides, aren’t you
in the wrong part of town?

426
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,600
At your store,
they said you were here.

427
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,500
Hold on a minute.
Come on, kids.

428
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,100
All right, all right.
Who wants what?

429
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,600
I wanted the yellow one.

430
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:07,100
Give it to him.
Hes the baby.

431
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,400
Stop! You want one?

432
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,500
Sure. I want the yellow one.

433
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,700
Well, you get a green one.

434
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,900
Did you talk to your brother?

435
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,200
What made you think that?

436
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,700
Hey, time-out.

437
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,700
See that guy?
He works for my dad.

438
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,300
Hes got a bad attitude.

439
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,100
Who’s your friend?

440
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,000
We met in line.
I didn’t catch your name.

441
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,100
- Whats your name?
- My friends call me Ahkbar.

442
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,100
Well, Ahkbar, this is Mac.
Mac, Ahkbar.

443
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,300
As-Salaam-Alaikum, Ahkbar.

444
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,400
Yo, ain’t that the guy?

445
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,300
Hell, yeah.

446
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,500
Same chump took Mos ride
after he beat us down.

447
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,500
Nobody ever kicked my ass.
What are you talking about?

448
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:06,900
That the dude.

449
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,600
We can’t start because were
a man short. Would you help us out?

450
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,700
Me?

451
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,800
No. I don’t know this game.

452
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Man, it’s easier than breathing.

453
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,900
Besides, Trish loves football players.

454
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,500
Right on.

455
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,200
Fellas, got myself a fresh recruit.

456
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,800
Hes a rookie...

457
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,200
...so take it easy on him.

458
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,100
Give me that!

459
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,200
The brothers and I
always give rookies warm welcomes.

460
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,200
So don’t worry about a thing.

461
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,400
I just need you to stand behind me.

462
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,400
I’ll give you the ball, and you run
to the far end of the field.

463
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,200
That’s all?

464
00:50:58,600 --> 00:50:59,800
That’s all.

465
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,900
Set!

466
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,500
Let’s see your special.

467
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Mos special!

468
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,300
Were coming, boys.

469
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:18,200
- Run!
- Run?

470
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,800
Come on!

471
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:36,000
Damn.

472
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,100
Like I told your ass before.

473
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,300
You ain’t the only one
that knows some shit.

474
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,300
Good job, my man.

475
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,900
- Are they allowed to do that?
- Sure.

476
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,600
It’s a contact sport.

477
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,500
This time, run a little bit
and turn up the middle.

478
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,600
And I’ll throw the ball to you.

479
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,900
It’s called the "buttonhook. "

480
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,500
- On two.
- Buttonhook.

481
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,700
Right there.

482
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,300
Set!

483
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,200
Damn! Shakalack-shakalack.
Mo, you my Negro, Mo.

484
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,200
Break his ass.

485
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,800
How come nobody else gets hit?

486
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,900
Because you have the ball.

487
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,400
Okay. I’d like hut three.

488
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,900
You all right?

489
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,600
Hey, brother!

490
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,200
American football!

491
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,200
- That was great!
- Brother!

492
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,100
- You were great.
- Damn, that was hot.

493
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,500
- Thanks.
- Youre welcome.

494
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,200
Here’s my address.

495
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,700
Please let me know
when you talk to your brother.

496
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,000
Here.

497
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,500
- Did you see that?
- Awesome!

498
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,800
I know. I know.

499
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,700
Pop ain’t feeling me.

500
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,600
He still wants me to ride around
with training wheels and shit.

501
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:29,200
I was like,
Pops gotta understand that...

502
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,600
...me and him is cut from,
like, the same cloth.

503
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,300
He needs to start respecting me
as a man.

504
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,900
I mean, he needs to start respecting
my manhood.

505
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,700
Shit, I went to college.

506
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,600
That’s right, baby. You did.

507
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,700
That’s right, baby. I did.

508
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,500
Like that phone call I got
the other day.

509
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,800
Pops too afraid about me handling
the business and stuff.

510
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,600
But, baby, I got ideas.
I mean, you know I got ideas.

511
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,800
It’s like...
Shit, I am an idea.

512
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,900
Im about to have
an Einstein moment.

513
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,400
Magic about to happen.
Its gonna be scary.

514
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,200
Hey, look, all I want to know is...

515
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,100
...when does Colin ODay
get to run with the show?

516
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,200
Don’t worry, baby.
Your turns coming.

517
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,700
Sorry, Mr. ODay.
These things are never easy.

518
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,200
Wait. Wait.

519
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,200
Don’t look at this. Come on.

520
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,000
Look at me. Please!

521
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,600
No!

522
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,000
You had something to do with this.

523
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,400
- What you want me to say?
- Go to hell.

524
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,400
- Go to hell.
- What do you want?

525
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:49,000
Youre as responsible as the people
who did this to my brother.

526
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,000
Don’t come near me.
I hate you.

527
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,500
You might as well have thrown him
out that window yourself.

528
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,200
That was my boy, Mac.

529
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,300
I know.

530
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,400
They killed my boy.

531
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,200
Were at the crossroads now, Isaak.

532
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,500
I won’t pretend I know
what youre feeling.

533
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,800
But I know you gotta keep it
stitched up until business is done.

534
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,800
The people who did this...

535
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,300
...I promise you on my life...

536
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,500
...they’ll be knocked out of the box
in due time.

537
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:52,100
I’ll make sure of it.

538
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,200
What happened?

539
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:16,500
Once, Colin and I did something
we thought would really be funny.

540
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,200
He hid out front...

541
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,500
...while I ran to tell my mom
hed been hurt.

542
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,400
Hit by a car or something
really bad like that.

543
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,500
When she came,
he was supposed to jump out.

544
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,400
You know, surprise her...

545
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,900
...and wed all fall out
and have this great laugh.

546
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,700
Me and my mom always loved
a good laugh.

547
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,300
I was about 8 or 9.

548
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,100
Colin was, like, 11.

549
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:52,300
I don’t remember
how we came up with it...

550
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,400
...but, sure enough, I start
screaming and yelling...

551
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,900
...and my mom runs out of the house.
She’s, like, "Trish, whats wrong?"

552
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,900
When I told her, I mean...

553
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,400
...the look on her face.

554
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:11,000
Even when Colin popped up to show it
was a joke, she couldn’t stop crying.

555
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,800
She just held him close.

556
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,100
Clutched him, you know?

557
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,500
I was just a baby. I didn’t get it
then, but I get it now.

558
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:25,700
Tell me.

559
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,000
- What happened?
- Colins dead.

560
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,700
And no matter how hard I cry...

561
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,200
...he’s not gonna pop up
and show me it was just a joke.

562
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,600
Im sorry.

563
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,600
I need your help.

564
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,700
I gotta put this thing together
just as much as you do now.

565
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,800
Gentlemen, we are ready
to approach the NFL.

566
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,200
I don’t think any of the other bids
are even in contention.

567
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,400
Our package is staggering.

568
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,900
Weve got the money,
the organization...

569
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:09,400
...waterfront real estate
seconds from the bridge.

570
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,700
God Himself couldn’t have designed
a better spot for a stadium.

571
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,300
That’s right. You know me well.

572
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,300
If I say there’s caviar on
the mountain, you bring the crackers.

573
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,700
I don’t get it.

574
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,700
These are waterfront properties.

575
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,100
They must mean something.

576
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,200
Po didn’t want them found.

577
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,500
Yeah, but why?

578
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,200
Is this the place?

579
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,800
Yeah. It says 44 Driggs Road.

580
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,200
Is anybody here?

581
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,200
Get down!

582
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Youre Chinese.

583
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,500
No shit!

584
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:43,900
I can’t hit a girl.

585
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,300
In America, if a girls kicking your
ass, you don’t have to be a gentleman.

586
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,100
Damn. Look at that!

587
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,500
They a trip.

588
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,000
Them little things pay the rent,
you know what I mean?

589
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,300
Yeah, no doubt.

590
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,100
Crabs in a barrel cant climb out,
and they don’t want to stay in.

591
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,200
I guess they strange like that.

592
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,900
Some brothers strange like that too.

593
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,400
As soon as one of us move up...

594
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,900
...a crab motherfucker like yourself
pulls us right back down.

595
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,100
But let me tell you something.

596
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:30,300
This place seems like
a piece of shit to you...

597
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,300
...but that’s still my piece of shit.
And I ain’t selling it.

598
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,000
I got work to do.

599
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,200
Let’s look at it another way.

600
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,700
You got two choices.
You either sign us over the deed...

601
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:51,600
...or I blow your head off
and leave it with these crabs.

602
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:53,600
Now, which is it?

603
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,600
- Yo, yo! Okay!
- I can’t hear you!

604
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:59,000
All right! I’ll do it!

605
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,600
- What?
- I said, I’ll do it, man!

606
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:07,900
Go in and get me that deed.

607
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,300
Don’t look at me.
I’ll put your ass on the news.

608
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:17,400
Whats the matter with you, man?
You crazy?

609
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,400
I can live with that.

610
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,000
How are you? Good to see you.

611
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,200
Good to see you.

612
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,100
They don’t care about the war.

613
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,700
They don’t care if the damn barge
is on fire.

614
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
This is a treat.

615
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,300
- What brings you downtown?
- You heard about Victor Ho?

616
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,600
Were looking forward to
some blowback.

617
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,000
That’s why were here. We got a tip
this place will get hit.

618
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,900
You gotta be kidding me.

619
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,100
- When?
- Right now.

620
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:29,700
Get the money.

621
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,700
Thank you for attending this meeting...

622
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,300
...on such a short notice.

623
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,900
My dear brothers, when you expire...

624
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:51,300
...your territory will remain
within the collective.

625
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,800
Of course, since I alone survive...

626
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,100
...the collective is,
in actuality, only me.

627
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,100
You don’t want to be in my path
when my feet are put to the coals.

628
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:15,900
Misery loves company.

629
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,800
Oh, young Mr. Roth,
you sound nervous.

630
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,200
May I suggest acupuncture?

631
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,300
I hope you have some good news for me.

632
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,800
Theres no need for threats
or theatrics.

633
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
None of us want to drag this out
any longer than it already has.

634
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,500
Then close out your business
and get me those deeds.

635
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,800
Damn. Susie!

636
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,300
Could you get me Keyshawn Johnson,
please?

637
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,100
Its Papa, baby. It’s me.
Don’t be scared.

638
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,900
Listen, I need you to come with me.

639
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,900
Why?

640
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,500
I’ll tell you.
Just come on out front, okay?

641
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,100
I can’t have you hanging with
Chuu´s boy.

642
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,100
- His name is Han, Daddy.
- Okay, then.

643
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,700
Stay away from Han.

644
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,800
Afraid I’ll catch one of your
bullets?

645
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,700
It is too dangerous right now.

646
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:27,900
I’ll take my chances.

647
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,000
Did you do it?

648
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,500
Did I do what?

649
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,300
Did you have his brother murdered?

650
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,900
Where did that come from?

651
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:43,200
I need to know.

652
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,700
No, I didn’t.
I’m telling you, no.

653
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
I did not.

654
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,600
Trisha, look at me.

655
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:53,000
I had nothing to do with it.

656
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,500
But one of thems going to pay
for what happened to Colin.

657
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,100
Is that what a businessman is?

658
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,600
That’s what I call
protecting my family.

659
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,400
You can’t touch me!

660
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,200
Interception, baby!

661
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,300
- Come on, man.
- Running it back!

662
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,200
Look at that!
Go back to slow mo!

663
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,500
Im coming for you.

664
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:18,200
I ain’t gonna even look.

665
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,600
Im just gonna play.
I can’t see!

666
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:35,100
He could go...

667
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,400
...all the way!

668
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:40,800
How your mama doing?

669
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,100
How your mama doing?!

670
01:16:42,900 --> 01:16:44,900
Touchdown, baby!

671
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,200
Take it, take it!

672
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:51,000
These nuts in your mouth.

673
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,300
I said, put the nuts in your mou

674
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,300
Why yall not working?! Get to work!

675
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,800
Shiftless Negroes.

676
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,000
Toby! Go on!

677
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,500
Where is Mac, Maurice?

678
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:05,900
Hes out back.

679
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,200
I want to talk to him.

680
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,500
Yes, sir.

681
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,100
You sure you don’t want nothing?

682
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:24,300
No, Im okay.

683
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,800
I’ll be downstairs.

684
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,100
All right.

685
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,300
I remember sitting in that chair...

686
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,500
...watching you fix your hair
for your first date.

687
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,200
You hooked me up with Dexter Benson.

688
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,700
My man Dex.

689
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,400
- I really liked that boy.
- Please, Daddy.

690
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,500
He was so scared, he bit my lip
when he kissed me good night.

691
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:17,900
Wait a second.

692
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:21,000
You didn’t kiss that boy
on your first date.

693
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,900
That’s right, I did.

694
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,400
I guess I was trying
to get back at you.

695
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,300
You know, I hate to admit it...

696
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,500
...but I miss those times.

697
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,900
I can tell you
when I missed your ma the most.

698
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:45,300
At your graduations and your dates.

699
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,000
I know I ain’t never been able
to talk to you.

700
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,100
Theres a lot of things
I wanted to say.

701
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,200
It don’t ever come out right.
I know that.

702
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,100
I want you in my life.

703
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,200
There are...

704
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,000
...certain things...

705
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,900
Until I can prove these things...

706
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:13,700
...I want you to stay here with me.

707
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,500
Listen to me.

708
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:19,000
People out there will
try to hurt me by hurting you.

709
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,600
Like they did your brother.

710
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,700
I’ll be damned
if I let them do that.

711
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,700
Who is it?

712
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,100
You got a phone call.

713
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,400
Not now, Mac.

714
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:29,800
Its Roth.

715
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,000
Today’s a good day.

716
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:34,900
Its deed day.

717
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,900
- I trust everythings in order.
- Absolutely.

718
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,000
Tonight all my dreams come true.

719
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:42,100
I’ll see you at the club as planned.

720
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,400
I’ll have your check.

721
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,100
Where do we stand with Silk?

722
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,500
Were hooking up at 8:00.

723
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,200
Watch out for him.

724
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,500
The boys tricky.

725
01:19:54,700 --> 01:19:56,800
Don’t let him get the upper hand.

726
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,800
I can handle Silk.

727
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,900
Are you out of your mind?

728
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:16,800
What are you doing here?

729
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:18,800
I missed you.

730
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:23,300
You miss me. I’ll miss you when
my father finds out youre here.

731
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,000
Hes standing right outside the door.

732
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:27,700
What’ll I do with you?

733
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:29,400
Jesus!

734
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,000
Hey, Dad.

735
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,100
I gotta go take care of business.

736
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,900
You need anything,
you just say the word.

737
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,300
I am fine, Dad.

738
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,400
Im chilling.
You do what you gotta do, okay?

739
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:48,700
Jesus! Come on, you gotta go!

740
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,500
No, what do you...?

741
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,900
- You all right?
- Im fine, Daddy.

742
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:00,800
Listen, baby, you hungry?

743
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,600
They getting pizza.
Say the word, they’ll bring it up.

744
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:07,000
Im not hungry.
If I get hungry, I’ll let them know.

745
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,600
I’ll be back after a while.

746
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,300
Damn, this pizza good.

747
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,300
Baby girl, open up! I got some
sausage and pepperoni pizza!

748
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:26,000
Open up the door.
Ain’t no swine on it.

749
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:32,200
Pizza make you want to slap your mama.
Whats this, Dominoss?!

750
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,800
Damn, never been up in here before.

751
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:46,700
They got Prince up on the wall.

752
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:49,700
You a freak too, ain’t you, Trish?
Where you at?

753
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,700
Im coming around the corner.

754
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,300
Damn!

755
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,900
So where are we going?

756
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,200
Look.

757
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,200
All the places on this list
have been moved out or burned out.

758
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,500
Except this one.

759
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,700
I know this one.

760
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,500
My father and Mac talked about that.
Its Silk’s casino.

761
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,100
Casino?

762
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,200
Lets gamble.

763
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:20,800
All right.

764
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,400
Now youre giving me some
B- boy flavor.

765
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,200
Hip-hop.

766
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,200
I know hip-hop.

767
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,300
Hey, whats up?

768
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,800
Come on, he’s with me. Okay?
Can you give me a break?

769
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,600
You Isaaks girl?

770
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
That’s right, cutie.

771
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,200
Will you let me in?

772
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,400
All right.

773
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,000
Thank you. Come on.

774
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,000
Im not feeling this.
Let’s go to the dance floor.

775
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,200
- It’s not my scene.
- Not your scene? Cute. Let’s go.

776
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:49,000
Look here!

777
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,700
Man, can you believe this?

778
01:24:57,900 --> 01:24:59,500
What the hell is she doing?

779
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:14,100
Whats up, Trish?

780
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,000
Whats up, Silk?

781
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,300
Let’s talk.

782
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:18,600
All right.

783
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,400
Come on.

784
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:26,100
Your pops running around
like Donald Trump...

785
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,600
...grabbing up every piece of
waterfront he can get his hands on.

786
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,800
Now he wants to be a club owner.

787
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,800
Hes working on something big.

788
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,700
Something big?
I don’t care how big it is.

789
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,800
Your pops can sweat me,
and Mac can sweat me all they want.

790
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,800
But Silk is staying right here.

791
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:44,200
My sentiments exactly, Silkie.

792
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:48,200
I think we all should stay right here
for one more negotiation.

793
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,300
It’s like that, partner? You’re gonna
try to roll up in here on me?

794
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:54,500
- What the hell are you doing?
- Shut up.

795
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,700
Does my daddy know about this?

796
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:57,800
Sit down.

797
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,000
What?

798
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,300
What?

799
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,100
What?!

800
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,000
You might as well lose the gat.

801
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:07,900
It’s like I told your
punk ass before...

802
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,100
...I ain’t signing shit.

803
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:11,800
All right, I’ll sign it myself.

804
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,000
Well, well, well.

805
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,900
If it ain’t my man Dim Sum.

806
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,600
Busy night?

807
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,300
Ran off with the boss daughter,
threw a wrench in Mac’s program.

808
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,100
And now...

809
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,600
...you about to get your ass kicked.

810
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
Where is she?

811
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,400
You didn’t think you’d get
them panties, did you?

812
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
What?

813
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:50,000
Trish. You didn’t really think she was
gonna give it up to you, did you?

814
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,700
Here’s the deal, meatball.

815
01:26:54,300 --> 01:26:57,100
You let me go, I let you live.

816
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:02,000
He say he gonna let me live!

817
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,200
Im really gonna miss you.

818
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,000
The way you make me laugh.
But look on the bright side.

819
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,200
Some you win...

820
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,200
...and, Dim Sum, you lose.

821
01:27:30,300 --> 01:27:33,800
The hell what Mac say!
Somebody kill that son of a bitch!

822
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:49,100
Get up!

823
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:51,400
Get your bitch-asses up!
Come on!

824
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,200
Dim Sum!

825
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,800
Come out and play!

826
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,800
Hey, rice noodle!

827
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,000
What the hell you doing?!

828
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,600
I hope you land on your feet,
grasshopper.

829
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:14,400
Youre not the only one
knows some shit.

830
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,100
- Where is she?
- The Oakridge Mens Club.

831
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,900
Sorry, moron.

832
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,300
Names Maurice...

833
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,300
...bitch.

834
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,500
Cristal, Chu.

835
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:51,300
You only live once.

836
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,000
Everythings kosher,
down to the last pagoda.

837
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:57,500
Youre a good man.

838
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,200
Spend it well.

839
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,600
Mr. ODay.

840
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,000
Mr. Chu.

841
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,700
You once gave me your condolences.

842
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:35,100
I now offer mine
in regards to your son.

843
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,100
There’ll be ample time for you to
express your regrets, Mr. Chuu.

844
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,500
Amazing.

845
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,800
How much?

846
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:08,600
So this has been
what it’s all about, huh?

847
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:12,100
I wish my boy could see me do this.

848
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:14,100
And could be here.

849
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:16,500
Go ahead and keep that.

850
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:22,800
I don’t understand.

851
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:25,100
You just acquired another partner.

852
01:32:26,300 --> 01:32:29,200
I think it’s time the NFL
had a black owner. Don’t you?

853
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:33,100
Youre joking, right?

854
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:43,100
Youre not joking.

855
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:46,200
Im afraid I already have a partner.
Several, in fact.

856
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:48,400
Well, you just got another one...

857
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,300
...in fact.

858
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,100
Don’t forget, Mr. Roth,
without these deeds...

859
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,600
...you have no...

860
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,700
What is that popular term, Dave?

861
01:32:58,900 --> 01:32:59,900
Cheddar?

862
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:05,100
- Do you mind if I have a moment?
- No, go ahead.

863
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:13,300
So this is the plan?

864
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,600
You want to be partners with Roth.

865
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,000
I’ve been waiting for the right time
to tell you.

866
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,900
Im going to the owner’s box.

867
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:29,300
We are going to the owners box.

868
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,400
I ain’t playing with these people.

869
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:35,500
The owners box.

870
01:33:41,100 --> 01:33:43,200
I’ve had enough of this legit shit.

871
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Whats that?

872
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:50,300
I believe they call it
corporate restructuring. Right?

873
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,400
Isaak ODay Developments getting
straight jacked...

874
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,900
...by Machiavellian Inc.

875
01:33:57,800 --> 01:33:59,700
I almost forgot.

876
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,800
Im taking your most valued asset.

877
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,200
You blaze, we blaze.

878
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:10,600
Are you crazy?

879
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,000
Is she worth $38 million to you?

880
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,600
Now I know youre crazy.

881
01:34:19,700 --> 01:34:23,800
You lost your mind thinking whites would
let you own a piece of their game.

882
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,900
Me and Chu had an understanding.

883
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:30,900
Anybody who didn’t sign those deeds,
we took care of.

884
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:32,800
What do you mean?

885
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:35,500
He shot them.
I was there when he killed Silk.

886
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,000
So now after everything,
you really gonna try to do this?

887
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:43,500
I have been covering your ass
for years, Isaak.

888
01:34:44,100 --> 01:34:46,900
Quite frankly,
I am just tired of being your boy.

889
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:49,900
Just because you put your kids
through college...

890
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:53,500
...that’s supposed to make
all of your crooked straight?

891
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,900
Man, you want to own a damn box.

892
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,100
Mac just want to own the streets.

893
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,800
That’s always been your problem.

894
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:05,700
What about Colin?

895
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:07,800
What about him?

896
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,600
You killed Colin?

897
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,500
Even fake wars have casualties, Isaak.

898
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,100
I guess old Collard Green couldn’t fly.

899
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,100
Vince! Vince!

900
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,200
Damn it, Roth!

901
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,300
Watch her.

902
01:37:04,700 --> 01:37:05,700
Go get it!

903
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Take it down!

904
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,500
Take it down now!

905
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:27,800
No way!

906
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,400
Take it down!

907
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:43,900
Why did you kill my brother?

908
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,300
All that Chinese shit
happened in-house.

909
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,500
You have your own people
to thank for that.

910
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:57,300
Not that you’ll get the chance.

911
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,600
Sorry, Romeo, but you gotta die.

912
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,200
Damn...

913
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,600
...that’s some cold shit.

914
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:20,700
Weve called the police.

915
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,500
- Theres an ambulance on its way.
- Thank you.

916
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,500
Im all right, baby.
How you feeling?

917
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:28,300
You doing all right?
Im doing all right.

918
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:31,900
Is that Han?

919
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,100
Yes.

920
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:36,500
Youre the one whos been
making all this trouble, huh?

921
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,100
Let me shake your hand.

922
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:46,000
You got a firm grip. I like that.

923
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,200
Stay with your father.

924
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:50,700
I will.

925
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,000
He a lot shorter than I thought.

926
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,000
- I know.
- He just a little guy.

927
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,700
I don’t know what to do with you.

928
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,600
Your brother wasn’t suited to lead.

929
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,100
He didn’t have the discipline.

930
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:36,500
That’s why you killed him.

931
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,500
That’s why I had to.

932
01:39:39,100 --> 01:39:40,200
Had to?

933
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,500
My brother.

934
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:46,200
That’s right.

935
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,500
That...

936
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:50,400
...was a mistake.

937
01:39:50,700 --> 01:39:51,700
Come on.

938
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:16,700
Come on!

939
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:23,900
Give me some skin!

940
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:37,100
Are you okay?

941
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,500
Im okay.

942
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,400
Come on, let’s go.

943
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
