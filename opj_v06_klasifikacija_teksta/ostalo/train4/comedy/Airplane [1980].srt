The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

3
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,929
There is no stopping in the red zone.

4
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:42,226
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

5
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,146
There is no stopping in the red zone.

6
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,986
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

7
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,614
There is no stopping in the red zone.

8
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:00,953
The white zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

9
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,748
There is no stopping in the red zone.

10
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,919
Hello. We'd like you to have this flower

11
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,629
from the Religious
Consciousness Church.

12
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:13,049
- Would you care to make a donation?
- No, but thank you, anyway.

13
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,889
The red zone is for immediate loading
and unloading of passengers only.

14
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,059
There is no stopping in the white zone.

15
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,479
No, the white zone
is for loading and unloading,

16
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,398
and there is no stopping in the red zone.

17
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,569
The red zone has always been
for loading and unloading.

18
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,197
There is never stopping in a white zone.

19
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:40,451
Don't tell me which zone is for stopping
and which zone is for loading.

20
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:43,913
Listen, Betty, don't start up
with your white zone shit again.

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,876
Hello. We'd like you to have this flower

22
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,170
from the Church
of Religious Consciousness.

23
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:52,797
Would you like to make a donation?

24
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,424
No, thanks. We gave at the office.

25
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,635
Flight 988 to Milwaukee

26
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,805
is now in the final boarding process
at Gate 34.

27
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:08,020
Would you put all your metal objects
into this dish, please?

28
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,531
There's just no stopping in a white zone.

29
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,908
Oh, really, Vernon? Why pretend?

30
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,870
We both know perfectly well
what it is you're talking about.

31
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,830
You want me to have an abortion.

32
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:29,250
It's really the only sensible thing to do,
if it's done properly.

33
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:32,545
Therapeutically,
there's no danger involved.

34
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,713
Taxi!

35
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,472
I'll be back in a minute.

36
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,565
Hello, sir.
We'd like you to have this flower

37
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,901
on behalf of the Church
of Religious Consciousness.

38
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,611
Would you care...

39
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,628
Hey, Larry, where's the forklift?

40
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,087
Forklift?

41
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,007
It's over there by the baggage loader.

42
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,929
Look out!

43
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:36,859
- Elaine!
- Ted!

44
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,196
I came home early and found your note.

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,448
I guess you meant
for me to read it later.

46
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,408
Elaine, I've gotta talk to you.

47
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,869
I just don't wanna go over it anymore.

48
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,580
I know things haven't been right
for a long time,

49
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,123
but it'll be different.

50
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,959
Like it was in the beginning.

51
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,127
If you'll just be patient,
I can work things out.

52
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,422
I have been patient,
and I've tried to help,

53
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,424
but you wouldn't even let me do that.

54
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,638
Don't you feel anything
for me at all anymore?

55
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,017
It takes so many things
to make love last.

56
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,478
Most of all, it takes respect.

57
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,481
And I can't live with a man
I don't respect.

58
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:23,864
What a pisser.

59
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,751
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.

60
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:38,921
Captain Clarence Oveur,
white courtesy phone.

61
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,721
- No, the white phone.
- Oh.

62
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,225
This is Captain Oveur.

63
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,936
One moment for your call
from the Mayo Clinic.

64
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,606
Captain Oveur, white courtesy phone.
Captain Clarence Oveur.

65
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,276
- I've got it!
- Thank you.

66
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,028
Go ahead with your call.

67
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:04,030
This is Dr. Brody at the Mayo Clinic.

68
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,866
There's a passenger
on your Chicago flight, 209'er.

69
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,286
A little girl named Lisa Davis,
en route to Minneapolis.

70
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,038
She's scheduled for a heart transplant,

71
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,999
and we'd like you to tell her mother
that we found a donor an hour ago.

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,959
We have the heart here
ready for surgery.

73
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:20,546
We must have the recipient
on the operating table within six hours.

74
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,841
I want you to make sure
that she's kept in a reclined position,

75
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,719
and that a continuous watch
is kept on her IV.

76
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,555
Also, it's very important
that she remain calm.

77
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,891
Excuse me,
this is the operator, Captain Oveur.

78
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:35,895
I have an emergency call
for you on line 5 from a Mr. Hamm.

79
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,189
All right, give me Hamm on 5,
hold the Mayo.

80
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,967
Look. You'll be back
in town tomorrow night.

81
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,053
We'll have dinner. We'll talk things over.

82
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,931
I won't be back.
I've requested the Atlanta run.

83
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,224
Elaine,

84
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,726
I promise I can change.

85
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:20,189
Then why didn't you take the job
that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?

86
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,984
You know I haven't been able
to get near a plane since the war.

87
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,277
Even if I could,

88
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,446
they wouldn't hire me
because of my war record.

89
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,697
Your war record?

90
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,117
You're the only one keeping that alive.

91
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,577
For everyone else, it's ancient history.

92
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,538
You expect me to believe that?

93
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,081
It's the truth.

94
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,959
What's hurt you the most
is your record since the war.

95
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,794
Different cities, different jobs.

96
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:45,464
And not one of them shows
you can accept any real responsibility.

97
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,551
- Elaine, if you just give me one more...
- It's too late, Ted.

98
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:53,430
When I get back to Chicago,
I'm going to start my life all over again.

99
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,849
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,854
Excuse me,
we'd like you to have this flower

101
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,690
from the Church
of Religious Conscious...

102
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,158
- Good evening.
- Hi.

103
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,326
Well, good evening. There you go.

104
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,411
You can just follow all the way back.

105
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,495
- Thank you.
- Hi, how are you tonight?

106
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,621
Hello.

107
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:24,211
Any word on that storm
lifting over Salt Lake, Clarence?

108
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,422
No, not likely, Victor.

109
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:31,177
I just reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

110
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,262
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas,

111
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,806
backed up all the way to Utah.

112
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,933
Yeah, well, if she decides to push over
to the Great Lakes,

113
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,019
it could get plenty soupy.

114
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,896
Hey, what about that southern route
around Tulsa?

115
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,398
Well, I double-checked
the terminal forecast,

116
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,735
and the wind's aloft,
and IFR ceilings all the way.

117
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,403
Where do they top out?

118
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,657
Well, there's some light scattered cover
at 20,000, icing around 18.

119
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,745
It looks like the original flight plan
over Denver is the best bet.

120
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,371
Denver it is.

121
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,497
Sorry, Clarence.

122
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,625
Latest weather report
shows everything socked in

123
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,168
from Salt Lake to Lincoln.

124
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,045
Oh, hi, Roger. Glad to have you aboard.

125
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,088
Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Victor Basta.

126
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,257
- How do you do, Roger?
- Nice to meet you.

127
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,717
Roger, I was telling Victor,

128
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,512
I reviewed the area report
for 1600 hours through 2400.

129
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,476
There's an occluded front
stalled over the Dakotas.

130
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,737
There you go. Thank you.

131
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,491
Can you tell me
if Elaine Dickinson is on this flight?

132
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,077
Well, the whole flight crew has boarded.

133
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,495
Let me see.

134
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,456
Oh, yes. She is on board.

135
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,920
I'd like one ticket to Chicago.

136
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,255
No baggage.

137
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,846
- Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Smoking, please.

138
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,434
There. Have a nice trip.

139
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,537
Striker, this is Red Leader 4.

140
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,206
Primary target covered by fog.

141
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,458
The decision to proceed is yours.

142
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,295
The decision is yours.

143
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,965
Is yours.

144
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,891
Shit, man.

145
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,876
Nervous?

146
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,836
Yes.

147
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,963
First time?

148
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,801
No, I've been nervous lots of times.

149
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,311
Hi, we'll be taking off real soon,
so I better fasten you in tight.

150
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,396
Thank you.

151
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,398
Oh, Mother, this is so exciting.

152
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,442
I know, but remember,
you must get some rest.

153
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,652
That's good advice.

154
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,405
You relax,
and I'll be back right after we take off.

155
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:20,864
Thank you.

156
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:27,287
- God, Bill, I'm gonna miss you so much.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

157
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,997
Promise you'll write?

158
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,166
Every day.

159
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,253
Bill!

160
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,755
Better get onboard, son.

161
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,175
All aboard!

162
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,263
209'er to ground control.
We're loaded and ready to taxi.

163
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,098
Goodbye, Bill!

164
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
Goodbye, darling!

165
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,059
I love you, darling!

166
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,728
209'er, taxi to runway 19'er.

167
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,066
Goodbye, darling!

168
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,652
Have your picture taken
the minute you get there

169
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,945
and send me one, all right?

170
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,655
Okay. Here, hurry.

171
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,369
But your watch. You shouldn't.
You're gonna need this.

172
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,539
- It's all right. It doesn't work.
- Bill!

173
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,957
Goodbye, darling!

174
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,375
Bill...

175
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:18,172
Bill! Bill... With me all the time.

176
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,381
- I swear to you!
- So long, darling.

177
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,966
Take care of yourself. Goodbye!

178
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,427
Flight 209'er, you're cleared for takeoff.

179
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,761
- Roger.
- Huh?

180
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,806
L.A. Departure frequency, 123.9'er.

181
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,266
- Roger.
- Huh?

182
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,810
- Request vector. Over.
- What?

183
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,688
Flight 209'er, clear for vector 324.

184
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,148
We have clearance, Clarence.

185
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,901
Roger, Roger.
What's our vector, Victor?

186
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,320
Tower radioed clearance, over.

187
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,489
That's Clarence Oveur, over.

188
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,948
- Roger.
- Huh?

189
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,366
- Roger. Over.
- What?

190
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,951
- Huh?
- Who?

191
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,771
Do you feel all right, sir?

192
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,525
I haven't flown for a long time.

193
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,577
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Oveur speaking.

194
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,162
- Here you go.
- We'll be cruising

195
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:34,498
- at 36,000 feet this evening.
- Stewardess?

196
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:39,836
Our arrival time in Chicago
will be 10:45 p.m. Central time.

197
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,214
The temperature there
is currently 62 degrees,

198
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,716
with a 20% chance of precipitation.

199
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:47,135
Meanwhile, relax and enjoy your flight.

200
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,014
- Would you like something to read?
- Do you have anything light?

201
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:57,187
How about this leaflet,
"Famous Jewish Sports Legends"?

202
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,897
Yes. Thank you.

203
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,902
- Ted! What are you doing here?
- Elaine, I've got to talk to you.

204
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,530
You shouldn't have come.
I don't have time now.

205
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,740
- Oh, stewardess?
- Excuse me.

206
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,033
But...

207
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,965
No wonder you're upset.

208
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,675
She's lovely.

209
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,470
And a darling figure.

210
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,682
Supple, pouting breasts.

211
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,059
Firm thighs.

212
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,188
It's a shame you two don't get along.

213
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,190
Yes, I know.

214
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,235
Things used to be different.

215
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,531
I remember when we first met.

216
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,993
It was during the war.

217
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,746
I was in the Air Force,

218
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,915
stationed in Drambuie
off the Barbary Coast.

219
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,502
I used to hang out at the Magumba Bar.

220
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,964
It was a rough place,
the seediest dive on the wharf,

221
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,383
populated with every reject
and cutthroat

222
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,719
from Bombay to Calcutta.

223
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,846
It was worse than Detroit.

224
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:26,360
The mood in the place
was downright ugly.

225
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,488
You wouldn't walk in there
unless you knew how to use your fists.

226
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,283
You could count on a fight
breaking out almost every night.

227
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:47,232
I didn't go there that night to fall in love.
I just dropped in for a couple of drinks.

228
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,359
But suddenly, there she was.

229
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,956
I was captivated, entranced.
It hit me like a thunderbolt.

230
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,916
I had to ask the guy next to me
to pinch me

231
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,294
to make sure I wasn't dreaming.

232
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:16,344
I was afraid to approach her.
But that night, fate was on my side.

233
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,742
We laughed. We talked.

234
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,744
We danced.

235
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,456
I never wanted it to end.
Hell, I guess I still don't.

236
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,543
But enough about me.
I hope this hasn't been boring for you.

237
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,504
It's just that whenever
I start to talk about Elaine,

238
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,798
I always get so carried away.

239
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,758
I lose all track of time.

240
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,469
Would you like to order dinner now?

241
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,722
Yes. Joey will have the steak,
and my wife and I will have the fish.

242
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,641
When can I see the cockpit, Dad?

243
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,767
Joey, I think the pilots

244
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,561
are probably too busy
flying the plane for that.

245
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,188
Oh, gee whiz.

246
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,481
I'll tell you what, Joey.

247
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,150
I'll talk to the captain
and see what I can arrange.

248
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:01,111
Gee, that'd be swell!

249
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,741
Would you gentlemen
care to order your dinners?

250
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,123
Lookie here.

251
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:24,843
Excuse me.

252
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,469
I happened to be passing,

253
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,972
and I thought
you'd might like some coffee.

254
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,683
Oh, that's very nice of you. Thank you.

255
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,146
Won't you sit down?

256
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,564
Thank you.

257
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,900
Cream?

258
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,153
No, thank you. I take it black.

259
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,612
Like my men.

260
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,122
Well, you see...

261
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,852
Oh, Ted, I never knew
I could be so happy.

262
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:01,481
These past few months
have been just wonderful.

263
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,566
Tomorrow, why don't we drive
up the coast

264
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:05,568
to that little seafood place, and...

265
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,154
What's the matter?

266
00:24:08,823 --> 00:24:10,782
My orders came through.

267
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,700
My squadron ships out tomorrow.

268
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:16,371
We're bombing the storage depots
at Daiquiri at 1800 hours.

269
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,873
We're coming in from the north,
below their radar.

270
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,834
When will you be back?

271
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,877
I can't tell you that.

272
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,170
It's classified.

273
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:28,466
Oh, Ted, please be careful.
I worry about you so much.

274
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,553
I love you, Elaine.

275
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,513
I love you.

276
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,247
Flight 209'er,
this is Denver flight control.

277
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,207
You're approaching
some rough weather.

278
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:03,418
Please climb to 42,000 feet.

279
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,171
Roger, Denver.

280
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,089
We have a visitor.

281
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,424
- Hello.
- Hi.

282
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,552
This is Captain Oveur,
Mr. Murdock and Mr. Basta.

283
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,803
This is Joey Hammen.

284
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,014
- Well, hi, Joey.
- Come on up here. You can see better.

285
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,808
Joey, we have something here
for our special visitors.

286
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:22,187
- Would you like to have it?
- Thank you. Thanks a lot!

287
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,606
Sure.
You ever been in a cockpit before?

288
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,942
No, sir,
I've never been up in a plane before.

289
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,445
Have you ever seen
a grown man naked?

290
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,363
Do you want me to check
the weather, Clarence?

291
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,532
No, why don't you take care of it?

292
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:38,203
Joey, do you ever
hang around a gymnasium?

293
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,330
We'd better get back now, Joey.

294
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,624
No, Joey can stay here
for a while if he'd like.

295
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,959
- Could I?
- Okay. If you don't get in the way.

296
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,045
Flight 209'er to Denver radio.

297
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,339
Climbing to cruise at 42,000.

298
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,675
Will report again over Lincoln.
Over and out.

299
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,886
Wait a minute. I know you.

300
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,846
You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

301
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,974
You play basketball
for the Los Angeles Lakers.

302
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,394
I'm sorry, son, but you must
have me confused with someone else.

303
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:06,397
My name is Roger Murdock.
I'm the co-pilot.

304
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,610
You are Kareem. I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

305
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:14,280
I think you should go back
to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?

306
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,409
No, he's not bothering anyone.
Let him stay here.

307
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,954
All right, but just remember,

308
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,581
my name is Roger Murdock.

309
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,250
I'm an airline pilot.

310
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,126
I think you're the greatest,

311
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:30,672
but my dad says
you don't work hard enough on defense.

312
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,760
And he says that lots of times,
you don't even run downcourt.

313
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,305
And that you don't really try
except during the playoffs.

314
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,099
The hell I don't!

315
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,435
Listen, kid.

316
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,980
I've been hearing that crap
ever since I was at UCLA.

317
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,483
I'm out there
busting my buns every night.

318
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,610
Tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

319
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,280
up and down the court for 48 minutes.

320
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,037
Joey?

321
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,332
You like movies about gladiators?

322
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,214
Elaine, just hear me out.

323
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:18,011
I know things haven't been right
for a long time, but it'll be different.

324
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,722
Like it was in the beginning, remember?

325
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,724
I remember everything.

326
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:26,978
All I have are memories.

327
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:30,398
Mostly, I remember the nights
when we were together.

328
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,067
I remember how you used to hold me.

329
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,280
How I used to sit on your face
and wriggle,

330
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:41,117
and afterwards how we'd watch
till the sun came up.

331
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,870
When it did, it was almost like...

332
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:49,083
Like each new day
was created only for us.

333
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,086
That's the way
I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.

334
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,796
But it won't be.

335
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,091
Not as long as you insist
on living in the past.

336
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,064
You're too low, Ted. You're too low.

337
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,031
You mustn't believe everything
that you see.

338
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,867
The mind can play tricks on people.

339
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,786
Pain. Pain.

340
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,413
- He looks so happy today, doesn't he?
- Okay, I'll be back.

341
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:29,791
Thank you, thank you.
You look so happy today.

342
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,545
Okay, Robert, slip them down.
This won't hurt much.

343
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,963
Give me a big smile.

344
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,716
You got a telegram
from headquarters today.

345
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,385
Headquarters! What is it?

346
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,637
Well, it's a big building
where generals meet,

347
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,555
but that's not important right now.

348
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,890
They've cleared you of any blame

349
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,392
for what happened on that raid.

350
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:48,684
Isn't that good news?

351
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:50,812
Is it?

352
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,441
Because of my mistake,
six men didn't return from that raid.

353
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,695
Seven, Lieutenant Zipp
died this morning.

354
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,948
But Dr. Sandler says
you'll be out in a week.

355
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,783
Isn't that wonderful?

356
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,912
I wish I could say the same
for George Zipp.

357
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,580
Be patient, Ted.

358
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:12,917
Nobody expects you
to get over this immediately.

359
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,254
Hey, Striker. How about a break?
I'm getting tired.

360
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,090
Yeah, all right. Take five.

361
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,135
Thanks.

362
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:26,013
I've found a wonderful apartment for us.

363
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,308
It has a brick fireplace
and a cute little bedroom

364
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,727
with mirrors on the ceiling, and...

365
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,397
Red Leader! Red Leader!
I'm going down.

366
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,149
Captain Geline.

367
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:38,276
He thinks he's a pilot,
still fighting the war.

368
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,569
...around here somewhere.

369
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,489
I've found the tunnel, Johnson!
It's this way!

370
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:46,701
$25 for a cigarette is too much!

371
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,581
What's his problem?

372
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,374
That's Lieutenant Hurwitz.

373
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,543
Severe shellshock.

374
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,753
He thinks he's Ethel Merman.

375
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,214
You'll be swell

376
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,757
You'll be great

377
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:04,844
Gonna have the whole world on a plate

378
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,930
Startin' here, startin' now

379
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:12,185
Honey, everything's coming up

380
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,396
roses

381
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,732
War is hell.

382
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,822
Excuse me, sir.

383
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:27,533
Would you like some coffee
before we serve dinner?

384
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,410
No. No, thank you.

385
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,581
Would either of you like
another cup of coffee?

386
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,333
I will, but Jim won't.

387
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,294
I think I will have another cup of coffee.

388
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,924
Jim never has
a second cup of coffee at home.

389
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,766
- Excuse me, Sister.
- Yes?

390
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,518
There's a little girl onboard, up front,

391
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:56,687
- who's ill and, well...
- Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.

392
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,691
Could I borrow your guitar?
I thought maybe I could cheer her up.

393
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:04,362
- Oh, of course.
- Thank you. Thank you.

394
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,537
- Hi.
- Hi.

395
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,039
Do you mind if I talk to your daughter?

396
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,250
Why, I think that'd be nice.

397
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,962
Hi, I'm Randy.

398
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,547
I'm Lisa.

399
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,382
Oh, you have a guitar.

400
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,426
I thought maybe
you'd like to hear a song.

401
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,346
I'd love to.

402
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,639
Okay.

403
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,474
Let's see.

404
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,685
This is one of my favorites.

405
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,901
I traveled the banks
of the River of Jordan

406
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:48,406
To find where it flows to the sea

407
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,411
I looked in the eyes
of the cold and the hungry

408
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:59,000
And I saw that I was looking at me

409
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:04,130
And I wanted to know
if life had a purpose

410
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,550
And what it all means in the end

411
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:12,179
In the silence I listened
to voices inside me

412
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,518
And they told me again and again

413
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:21,772
There is only one river

414
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,109
There is only one sea

415
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,321
And it flows through you

416
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:31,532
And it flows through me

417
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,785
There is only one people

418
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,080
We are one and the same

419
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:42,126
We are all one spirit

420
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,338
One name

421
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:47,340
We are the father

422
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:57,266
We are one

423
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,440
A little late tonight.
We've been waiting for you.

424
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,817
- Who wants to be first?
- Go ahead, Clarence. I got it.

425
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,736
- Okay.
- How's the weather?

426
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,906
Not so good.
We got some heavy stuff ahead of us.

427
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,325
It might get rough again
unless we can climb on top.

428
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,285
Yeah, after the war,

429
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,996
I just wanted to get
as far away from things as possible,

430
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,957
so Elaine and I joined the Peace Corps.

431
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,920
We were assigned to an isolated tribe.

432
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,505
The Molombos.

433
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,299
They'd never seen Americans before.

434
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,524
It was really a challenge
during the year,

435
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:49,443
introducing them to our Western culture.

436
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,325
At first they didn't know
what to think of us.

437
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,786
But soon, we gained their trust.

438
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:11,173
It'll help you better prepare storing foods

439
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:14,677
for the up and coming monsoon months.

440
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:19,557
Also, Supperware products
are ideal for storing leftovers

441
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,476
to help stretch your food dollar.

442
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:29,150
This 2-quart Seals-M-Rite container
keeps hot dog buns fresh for days.

443
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,819
You must understand,
these people had been

444
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,071
completely isolated from civilization.

445
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,491
No one had ever outlined
a physical fitness program for them,

446
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,660
and they had no athletic equipment.

447
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,537
I started them on simple calisthenics,

448
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,248
then gradually worked them up
to rudimentary game skills.

449
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,751
And finally,
advanced competitive theory.

450
00:34:47,586 --> 00:34:50,004
I was patient with them,
and they were eager to learn.

451
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,006
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

452
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,384
It was probably due to the advanced
American teaching techniques

453
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,179
that we were able to bridge
the generations of isolation

454
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:00,181
and communicate so successfully
with the Molombos.

455
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,523
I think they're getting the hang of it.

456
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:11,692
When we re-enlist,
I'll teach them baseball.

457
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,737
Ted, I don't wanna stay here.

458
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:19,074
It's time for us to go back home
to the plans we made before the war.

459
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,163
A lot of people made plans
before the war.

460
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,331
Like George Zipp.

461
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,671
It was at that moment that I first realized

462
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,424
Elaine had doubts
about our relationship.

463
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,386
And that, as much as anything else,
led to my drinking problem.

464
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,014
We did come back to the States.

465
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,767
I tried a number of jobs.

466
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:48,187
Well, I could go on for hours,
but I'd probably start to bore you.

467
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,189
You know, I really couldn't blame Elaine.

468
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,066
She wanted a career.

469
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,323
I can't stand it.

470
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,825
What is it?

471
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,077
- Yes?
- Oh, it's my stomach.

472
00:36:04,246 --> 00:36:07,498
I haven't felt this awful
since we saw that Ronald Reagan film.

473
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,960
I'll see if I can find some Dramamine.

474
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,428
Captain, one of the woman passengers
is very sick.

475
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,138
Airsick?

476
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,100
I think so,
but I've never seen it so acute.

477
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:31,272
Find out if there's a doctor on board
as quietly as you can.

478
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,152
Joey, have you ever been in a...

479
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,988
In a Turkish prison?

480
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,243
I shouldn't have had
that second cup of coffee.

481
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,506
Jim never vomits at home.

482
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,719
I'm sorry I had to wake you.
I'm just looking for a doctor.

483
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,554
There's nothing to worry about.

484
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,722
Stewardess?

485
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,641
I think the man sitting next to me
is a doctor.

486
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,311
Sir? Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry I have to wake you.

487
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,729
Are you a doctor?

488
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:12,980
That's right.

489
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,773
We have some passengers
that are very sick.

490
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:18,110
- Could you come take a look at them?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

491
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,663
Let me see your tongue.

492
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,237
I'll be back in a minute.

493
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,954
You'd better tell the captain,
we've got to land as soon as we can.

494
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,664
This woman has to be gotten
to a hospital.

495
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,582
A hospital, what is it?

496
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:16,460
It's a big building with patients.
But that's not important right now.

497
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,630
- Tell the captain I must speak to him.
- Certainly.

498
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,014
Victor, we're running into
some heavy weather, can you...

499
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,724
Roger, take over!

500
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:57,167
- Captain, how soon can you land?
- I can't tell.

501
00:38:57,252 --> 00:39:00,254
- You can tell me, I'm a doctor.
- No, I mean, I'm just not sure.

502
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,341
- Well, can't you take a guess?
- Well, not for another two hours.

503
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:07,511
You can't take a guess
for another two hours?

504
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,763
No, no, no. I mean,
we can't land for another two hours.

505
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,890
Fog has closed down everything
this side of the mountains.

506
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,518
We've got to get through to Chicago.

507
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:23,485
Get him out of there!

508
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,514
- What is it, Doctor? What's going on?
- I'm not sure.

509
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,060
I haven't seen anything like this
since the Anita Bryant concert.

510
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:57,770
What was it we had for dinner tonight?

511
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,814
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.

512
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,568
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
What did he have?

513
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,278
He had fish.

514
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,572
Doctor, there are two more sick people,

515
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,365
and the rest of the passengers
are worried.

516
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,867
I'll take care of the passengers.

517
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,996
Find out what the two sick people
had for dinner.

518
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,706
This is Captain Oveur speaking.

519
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,376
It's been a little bumpy up here,
but we'll be past it in a few minutes.

520
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,087
A couple points of interest.

521
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:26,423
We're now flying over Hoover Dam,
and a little later on,

522
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,675
we'll pass just to the south
of the Grand Canyon.

523
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,595
Meanwhile, relax
and enjoy your flight, okay?

524
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,100
Chicago, this is flight 209'er.

525
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,684
We're in trouble.

526
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,354
We've got to have all traffic
below us cleared,

527
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,815
and I want a priority approach
and landing in Chicago.

528
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:49,238
- Yes?
- Stewardess. My husband's very sick.

529
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,739
Can you do something, please?

530
00:40:50,824 --> 00:40:54,451
Well, the doctor will be
with you in just a moment.

531
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,829
One thing, do you know
what he had for dinner?

532
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,164
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?

533
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,125
It's nothing to be alarmed about.

534
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,669
We'll be back to you very quickly.

535
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,636
Dr. Rumack, Mr. Hammen ate fish,

536
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,763
and Randy said
there are five more cases,

537
00:41:14,848 --> 00:41:16,598
and they all had fish, too.

538
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,517
And the copilot had fish.

539
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,854
- What did the navigator have?
- He had fish.

540
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:24,815
All right. Now we know
what we're up against.

541
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,109
Every passenger on this plane
who had fish for dinner

542
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:30,612
will become violently ill
in the next half-hour.

543
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,906
Just how serious is it, Doctor?

544
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,783
Extremely serious.

545
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:38,328
It starts with a slight fever,
dryness of the throat.

546
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,205
As the virus penetrates
the red blood cells,

547
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,251
the victim becomes dizzy,
begins to experience an itching, a rash.

548
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,045
From there, the poison goes to work
on the central nervous system,

549
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,675
causing severe muscle spasms,
followed by the inevitable drooling.

550
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,511
At this point,
the entire digestive system collapses,

551
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,514
accompanied
by uncontrollable flatulence,

552
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,849
until finally the poor bastard

553
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:02,102
is reduced to a quivering,
wasted piece of jelly.

554
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,916
Turn on automatic pilot.

555
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,836
Automatic pilot. Automatic pilot.

556
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,338
There it is!

557
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,265
I'll go back to the passengers.

558
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,562
Come in, 209'er. This is Chicago.

559
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:47,773
Flight 209'er, come in.

560
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,735
This is Elaine Dickinson.
I'm the stewardess.

561
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,612
Captain Oveur's passed out on the floor,

562
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:55,739
and we've lost the copilot
and navigator, too.

563
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,407
We're in terrible trouble. Over.

564
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,784
Roger, Elaine, roger. I read you.

565
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,827
This is Steve McCroskey
at Chicago Air Control.

566
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,247
Get back to you in a minute.
Hold all takeoffs.

567
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,916
I don't want another plane in the air.
When the 508 reports,

568
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,376
- bring it straight in.
- Yes, sir.

569
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,586
Put out a general bulletin
to suspend all meal service

570
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,255
on flights out of Los Angeles.

571
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,298
Tell all dispatchers
to remain at their posts.

572
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,466
It's gonna be a long night.

573
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,051
- How about some coffee, Johnny?
- No, thanks.

574
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,387
I want the weather on every landing field
this side of the Rockies

575
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:19,680
no matter what the size.

576
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,265
Do you understand?

577
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,726
Anyplace. Anyplace where there's
a chance to land that plane!

578
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:28,563
Stan, go upstairs to the tower
and get a runway diagram.

579
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:31,942
Terry, check down the field
for emergency equipment.

580
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,361
Chief, we got fog,
right down to the deck,

581
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,154
every place east of the Rockies.

582
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,572
There's no possible place they can land.

583
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:40,284
They'll have to come
through to Chicago.

584
00:43:40,368 --> 00:43:42,953
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit smoking.

585
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,955
I want the best available man on this.

586
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,873
A man who knows
that plane inside and out

587
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:48,292
and won't crack under pressure.

588
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,168
How about Mr. Rogers?

589
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:55,465
Get me Rex Kramer.

590
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,641
Elaine, right next to the throttle
is the air-speed gauge.

591
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:05,934
What speed does it indicate?

592
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:10,856
520 miles per hour.

593
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,568
Good. Very good.
Now check your altitude.

594
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:18,822
That's the dial just below and to
the right of the air-speed indicator.

595
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,533
35,000 feet.

596
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,619
No, wait. 34,000 feet.

597
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,582
No, it's dropping. It's dropping fast.

598
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,126
Why is it doing that?

599
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,591
Oh, my God!
The automatic pilot, it's deflating!

600
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,093
Now, Elaine, don't panic.

601
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,472
On the belt line of the automatic pilot,
there is a hollow tube.

602
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,768
Now that is the manual inflation nozzle.
Pull it out and blow on it.

603
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,067
What the hell's going on up there?

604
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,040
Elaine?

605
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,500
Yes, Doctor?

606
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,254
Elaine, you're a member of this crew.

607
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,298
- Can you face some unpleasant facts?
- No.

608
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:03,718
All right. Unless I get all those people
to a hospital quickly,

609
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,720
I can't even be sure of saving their lives.

610
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,849
Now, is there anyone onboard
who can land this plane?

611
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:10,684
Well...

612
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,314
No, no one I know of.

613
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,109
I think you ought to know
what our chances are.

614
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,279
The life of everyone onboard
depends upon just one thing.

615
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:25,449
Finding someone back there
who can not only fly this plane,

616
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,200
but who didn't have fish for dinner.

617
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,382
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your stewardess speaking.

618
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,342
We regret any inconvenience

619
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:46,845
the sudden cabin movement
might have caused.

620
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,390
This is due to periodic air pockets
we encounter.

621
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:52,684
There's no reason to become alarmed,

622
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,270
and we hope you enjoy
the rest of your flight.

623
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,066
By the way, is there anyone onboard
who knows how to fly a plane?

624
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,891
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline.
I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.

625
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,727
Yes. Come in, Paul. Rex'll be right out.

626
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,525
Shep, sit. Sit.

627
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:44,402
So, I understand you have
a real emergency down there.

628
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,071
Yeah, something like that.

629
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,699
But as I say, they didn't have time
to tell me very much.

630
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,203
Shep, no!

631
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,665
I'll bet you have exciting things
happen all the time down there.

632
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,167
Well, the airline business
does have its moments,

633
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:02,003
but after a while
you begin to get used to it.

634
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,257
Shep, come!

635
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:10,136
He gets so excited
when new people are here.

636
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,639
Are you a pilot yourself?

637
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:16,101
No, I'm in a training program.

638
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:18,061
It's unbelievable!

639
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,063
Just unbelievable!

640
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,857
How many times I've warned
those people about food inspection.

641
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,819
You'd think after all these years,
someone would listen to you.

642
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,947
Oh, well. Airport management,
the FAA and the airlines,

643
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,285
they're all cheats and liars!

644
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:35,787
All right, let's get out of here.

645
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,129
I'm sorry to bother you.

646
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:47,507
I was just looking for someone
with flying experience.

647
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:51,344
When they built those roads,
they had no thought of drainage in mind.

648
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:55,223
So we had to take a special jeep
up to the main road.

649
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,851
In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep

650
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:02,105
since just the day before,
only one that we had broke down.

651
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,107
It had a bad axle.

652
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,650
Excuse me, sir.

653
00:49:05,735 --> 00:49:07,277
There's been a little problem
in the cockpit...

654
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,279
The cockpit! What is it?

655
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,823
It's the little room in the front
of the plane where the pilots sit.

656
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,116
But that's not important right now.

657
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,784
You see, the first officer is ill,

658
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:17,829
and the captain needs someone
to help him with the radio.

659
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,915
Do you know anything about planes?

660
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,586
Well, I flew in the war,
but that was years ago.

661
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,296
I wouldn't know anything about it.

662
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,590
Well, would you go up? Please?

663
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,567
The stewardess said that...

664
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,237
Both pilots?

665
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,573
Can you fly this plane and land it?

666
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,076
Surely you can't be serious?

667
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,870
I am serious. And don't call me Shirley.

668
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:03,792
Doctor, I've checked everyone.
Mr. Striker's the only one.

669
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,585
What flying experience have you had?

670
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,962
Well, I flew single-engine fighters
in the Air Force,

671
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,006
but this plane has four engines.

672
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,759
It's an entirely different
kind of flying altogether.

673
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,304
It's an entirely different kind of flying.

674
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,476
Besides, I haven't touched
any kind of plane in six years.

675
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,146
Mr. Striker, I know nothing about flying,

676
00:50:25,231 --> 00:50:27,357
but there's one thing I do know.

677
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,527
You're the only one on this plane
who can possibly fly it.

678
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:32,487
You're the only chance we've got.

679
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,905
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

680
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,657
No, that's what I said. You heard me.

681
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,743
Tell Omaha to acknowledge
and stand by.

682
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,705
Every piece of emergency equipment
you can reach.

683
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,540
Alert rescue units
at every mile of the way.

684
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,208
- From here to the Rockies.
- Chief?

685
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,669
We'll need a pre-landing flight check.

686
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,671
Tell them I'm in the dispatch office,
and I want it here fast.

687
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:32,756
It's your wife.

688
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,258
I want the kids in bed by 9:00.
I want the dog fed, the yard watered,

689
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,926
and the gate locked.
And get a note to the milkman.

690
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,762
No more cheese!

691
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:43,391
Where the hell is Kramer?

692
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:55,904
No, we can't do that.
The risk of a flameout's too great.

693
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:58,281
Keep them at 24,000.

694
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,616
No, feet.

695
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,121
One of the passengers
is gonna land that plane.

696
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,207
Is that possible?

697
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,708
Possible. It's a 100-to-1 shot.

698
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,963
1,000-to-1. I know this guy.

699
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,131
- You do?
- Asshole!

700
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:17,342
- Who is it?
- Name's Ted Striker.

701
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,968
I flew with him during the war.

702
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,554
And that won't make my job
any easier tonight.

703
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,184
Ted Striker was a crack flight leader
up to a point.

704
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,186
He was one of those men who...

705
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,648
Well, let's just say, felt too much inside.

706
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,858
Maybe you know the kind.

707
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,986
He went all to pieces
one particular mission.

708
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,949
Just hope that doesn't happen tonight.

709
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,332
Let's see.

710
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,293
Altitude, 24,000 feet.

711
00:52:53,754 --> 00:52:55,129
Level flight.

712
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:57,048
Speed, 520 knots.

713
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,759
Course, zero-niner-zero.

714
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,845
Trim, mixture.

715
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,888
Wash, soap, rinse, spin.

716
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:11,729
Ted! What are you doing here?
You can't fly this plane.

717
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,190
That's what I've been
trying to tell these people.

718
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,483
Elaine,

719
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:18,570
I don't have time to say this gently,
so I'll be very direct.

720
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:21,322
Everyone in this plane
is in a desperate situation.

721
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,117
Mr. Striker is the only hope we've got.

722
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,290
Those are the flaps.

723
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,125
This is the thrust.

724
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,920
This must turn on the landing lights.

725
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,436
Mayday! Mayday!

726
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:53,938
- Mayday!
- Mayday? What the hell is that for?

727
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,773
Mayday? Why,
that's the Russian New Year.

728
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:57,775
We'll have a big parade.
We'll serve hot hors d'oeuvres.

729
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,247
I can't stand it anymore.

730
00:54:11,332 --> 00:54:14,250
I've gotta get out of here.
I've got to get out of here!

731
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,002
Calm down. Get a hold of yourself!

732
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,795
Stewardess, please, let me handle this.

733
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,882
I've gotta get out.

734
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,302
Calm down, now get back to your seat.
I'll take care of this problem now.

735
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,387
Calm down! Get a hold of yourself.

736
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,848
Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.

737
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:31,434
Everything's gonna be all right, please!

738
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,187
- Sister, please. I'll handle this.
- Just try and get a hold of yourself.

739
00:54:34,313 --> 00:54:36,940
I've gotta get out of here!
I've gotta get out of here.

740
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,233
Out of here! I've gotta get out of here!

741
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:43,029
Excuse me,
we'd like you to have this flower.

742
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,574
Excuse me, sir, would you...

743
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,743
Donations for Reverend Moon?

744
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,079
Jews for Jesus?

745
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,247
Read about Jehovah's Witness.

746
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:56,209
How about Buddhism?

747
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,378
Help Jerry's kids?

748
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,588
Scientology?

749
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,965
More nuclear power?

750
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:10,682
Your attention please.

751
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:13,518
No-frills passengers now arriving.

752
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,270
Please have your baggage
claim checks ready

753
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,315
to show attendant
upon leaving the terminal.

754
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,944
I know, but this guy doing the flying
has no airline experience at all.

755
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,280
He's a menace to himself
and everything else in the air.

756
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,532
Yes, birds too.

757
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:31,077
Okay, okay, he's a terrible risk.
But what other choice have we got?

758
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,746
That's the whole story there, Rex.
Everything we know.

759
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:38,167
All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.

760
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,336
As you know, I flew with this man,
Striker, during the war.

761
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,839
He's gonna have enough on his mind
without worrying about those times

762
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,716
when things weren't so good.

763
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,509
Well, right now, things aren't so good.

764
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,553
Let me tell you something, Steve.

765
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,430
Ted Striker was
a top-notch squadron leader,

766
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,432
a long time ago.

767
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:56,436
Look, Rex, I want you to get on the horn
and talk that guy down.

768
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,814
Now, you're gonna have to let him
get the feel of that airplane on the way.

769
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,357
Then you'll have to talk him
onto the approach.

770
00:56:01,442 --> 00:56:04,902
So help me, you'll have to talk him
right down to the ground!

771
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,071
Very well.

772
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:10,742
- Put Striker on the speaker.
- Okay, use my radio over there.

773
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:15,538
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit drinking.

774
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,375
Now, you can work them
direct from here, Captain.

775
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,626
Thanks.

776
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,880
Striker?

777
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:27,800
Striker, this is
Captain Rex Kramer speaking.

778
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:34,599
Yes, Captain Kramer.
Read you loud and clear.

779
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,813
All right. It's obvious you remember me.

780
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,482
So, what do you say you and I

781
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:45,234
just forget about everything
except what we have to do now?

782
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,071
Let's not kid each other, Kramer.

783
00:56:48,155 --> 00:56:50,406
You know I've never flown
a bucket like this!

784
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:52,492
I'm gonna need all the luck there is.

785
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,410
Stand by, Striker.

786
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:56,954
Our one hope is to build this man up.

787
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,166
I've gotta give him
all the confidence I can.

788
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,626
Striker?

789
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:03,753
Have you ever flown
a multi-engine plane before?

790
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:04,921
No. Never.

791
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,048
Shit. This is a goddamn waste of time!

792
00:57:07,508 --> 00:57:08,758
There's no way he can land this plane!

793
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:11,928
Grab a hold of yourself.
You gotta talk him down. You gotta.

794
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,221
Route him into Lake Michigan.

795
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,431
At least he'll avoid
killing innocent people.

796
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,226
You're the only chance they've got!

797
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:22,188
All right.

798
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:26,025
Striker, you listen, and you listen close.

799
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,445
Flying a plane is no different
than riding a bicycle.

800
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,449
Just a lot harder
to put baseball cards in the spokes.

801
00:57:33,534 --> 00:57:35,326
Now first, I want you to get
the feel of the plane.

802
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:38,704
Later, we'll run down
the landing procedure.

803
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:46,003
All right, now I want you
to disengage the automatic pilot.

804
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:48,464
But watch out you don't make
any violent control movements

805
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:49,799
like you did in the fighter plane.

806
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:53,803
All right, I'm going to unlock
the automatic pilot.

807
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,477
Just remember,
the controls will feel very heavy

808
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,062
compared to a fighter.

809
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:08,234
Don't worry about that.
It's perfectly normal.

810
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,664
Now, one more thing,

811
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:23,374
is somebody there
who can work the radio

812
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,626
and leave you free for flying?

813
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:27,753
Yes. The stewardess is here with me.

814
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,631
Good. Have her sit in the copilot's seat.

815
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,887
Elaine, he wants you to sit
in the copilot's seat.

816
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,606
What's going on?
We have a right to know the truth.

817
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,484
All right, I'm gonna level with you all.

818
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,821
The most important thing now
is that you remain calm.

819
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,115
There is no reason to panic.

820
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:59,493
Now, it is true
that one of the crew members is ill.

821
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,162
Slightly ill.

822
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,207
But the other two pilots are just fine.

823
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,375
They're at the controls flying the plane,

824
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,961
free to pursue a life
of religious fulfillment.

825
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:11,088
The radio's all yours now.

826
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:14,133
And keep an eye on that
number three engine gauge, over there.

827
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:15,801
It's running a little hot.

828
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:22,141
Striker, before we start,
I'd like to say something.

829
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:26,062
I know that right now
things must look pretty rough up there,

830
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:29,023
but if you do what I tell you,
when I tell you to do it,

831
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,733
there's no reason
why you shouldn't have

832
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,526
complete confidence in your chances

833
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,321
to come out of this thing alive
and in one piece.

834
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,990
Striker, what kind of weather
you in up there?

835
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,201
Rain.

836
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:43,371
And a little ice.

837
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,164
How's it handling?

838
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,001
It's sluggish, like a wet sponge.

839
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:50,336
Sluggish,

840
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,213
like a wet sponge.

841
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,174
All right, Striker. You're doing just fine.

842
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:59,512
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know
how much I hate his guts.

843
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:03,683
It's a damn good thing you don't know
how much he hates your guts.

844
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,899
Can I get you something?

845
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,194
It's your mofo butter
laying me to the bone,

846
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:16,821
jacking me up.

847
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,322
Tightening me.

848
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:19,949
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

849
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,409
Cutty say he can't hang.

850
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:22,868
Oh, stewardess?

851
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,912
- I speak jive.
- Oh, good.

852
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:28,124
He said that he's in great pain,

853
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,792
and he wants to know
if you can help him.

854
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,752
All right.
Would you tell him to just relax,

855
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:35,172
and I'll be back as soon as I can
with some medicine.

856
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:38,551
Just hang loose, blood.

857
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,178
She gonna catch up
on the rebound on the medi side.

858
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:42,305
What it is, big mama?

859
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,557
My mama didn't raise no dummies.
I dug her rap.

860
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,309
Cut me some slack, Jack.

861
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,231
Chump don't want the help,
chump don't get the help.

862
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:53,816
Say he can't hang, say seven-up.

863
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,694
Jive-ass dude
don't got no brains, anyhow.

864
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,494
Macias, get me Captain Oveur's wife
on the phone.

865
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:06,662
We better let her know what's going on.

866
01:01:06,747 --> 01:01:10,082
Chief, this weather bulletin
just came off the wire.

867
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,003
Johnny, what do you make out of this?

868
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,254
This?

869
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:19,258
Why, I could make a hat or a brooch.
Or a pterodactyl, could eat your...

870
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,144
Hello?

871
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,522
- Mrs. Oveur?
- Yes, this is Mrs. Oveur.

872
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:36,025
This is Ed Macias
calling from the airport.

873
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,486
There's some trouble
on your husband's flight.

874
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,780
Now, we don't know
how serious it is yet.

875
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,783
But Steve McCroskey thought
you'd wanna get down here right away.

876
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,910
Yes, I'll be right down.

877
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,166
I've gotta go to the airport.

878
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,210
You can let yourself out the back door.

879
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,754
There's juice in the refrigerator.

880
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,765
Dr. Rumack says
the sick people are getting worse,

881
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,101
and we're running out of time.

882
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,354
I've got to concentrate.

883
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,481
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

884
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,149
I've got to concentrate.

885
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,819
Concentrate. Concentrate. Concentrate.

886
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:23,072
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

887
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,200
Echo! Echo! Echo! Echo!

888
01:02:26,326 --> 01:02:31,163
Pinch hitting for Pedro Borbon,
Manny Mota.

889
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,207
Mota. Mota. Mota.

890
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,463
- How you doing, honey?
- Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.

891
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,715
I'll turn on some air.

892
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,223
What's going on up there?

893
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,724
Close the window!

894
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,437
Chicago, the passengers
are beginning to panic.

895
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:56,230
When do we start down?

896
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,526
Not just yet. We'll have you
in radar range any second now.

897
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:04,113
I don't understand it. Should have been
in range 10 minutes ago.

898
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,906
Gunderson, check the radar range.
Anything yet?

899
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,453
It's about two more minutes, Chief.

900
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,834
Two more minutes?
They could be miles off course.

901
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,544
That's impossible.
They're on instruments.

902
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,509
This is gonna be a real sweat.

903
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:28,262
Gunderson, let me know
when you get anything.

904
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,889
Got a cigarette, Nels?

905
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,266
I can't take much more of this.

906
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:39,148
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit amphetamines.

907
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,984
- Johnny, how about some more coffee.
- No, thanks.

908
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:44,528
Chief, these reporters won't leave
without a statement.

909
01:03:44,613 --> 01:03:46,822
How much longer
can those passengers hold out?

910
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:48,491
Half-an-hour, maybe 45 minutes.

911
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:49,950
Who's flying the plane?

912
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,703
One of the passengers,
but he's an experienced Air Force pilot

913
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,455
who flew during the war,
so there's no cause for alarm.

914
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,831
Hinshaw, take over.

915
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,249
What kind of plane is it?

916
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:01,337
Oh, it's a big, pretty white plane
with red stripes,

917
01:04:01,421 --> 01:04:04,965
curtains in the window, and wheels,
and it looks like a big Tylenol.

918
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:08,177
Okay, boys. Let's get some pictures.

919
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,430
I want the one that'll block a wall.

920
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,019
C-47, right? I love that one.

921
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,375
This bulletin just handed to me.

922
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,043
Stricken airliner approaching Chicago.

923
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:58,602
Shana, they bought their tickets.

924
01:04:58,687 --> 01:05:01,397
They knew what they were getting into.

925
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:04,817
I say let them crash.

926
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,211
- Would you like a little whiskey, ma'am?
- Certainly not.

927
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,601
How are the passengers doing?

928
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:40,936
I won't deceive you, Mr. Striker.

929
01:05:41,021 --> 01:05:42,771
We're running out of time.

930
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,356
Surely there must be something
you can do.

931
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:46,942
I'm doing everything I can.

932
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:49,320
And stop calling me Shirley.

933
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,238
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

934
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,073
Find out what it means to me

935
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,034
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

936
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:56,493
Take out T-C-P

937
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,287
Sock it to me, sock it to me
Sock it to me, sock it to me

938
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,496
Sock it to me, sock it to me

939
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,665
A little respect, just a little bit

940
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,417
Just a little bit

941
01:06:13,178 --> 01:06:15,220
Randy, are you all right?

942
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,599
Dr. Rumack.

943
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,561
I'm scared. I've never been so scared.

944
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:27,149
And besides, I'm 26 and I'm not married.

945
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:31,111
Now, we're going to make it.
You've got to believe that.

946
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:34,448
Dr. Rumack, do you have any idea
when we'll be landing?

947
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,659
Pretty soon. How you bearing up?

948
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:39,745
Well, to be honest,
I've never been so scared.

949
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:42,956
But at least I have a husband.

950
01:06:55,804 --> 01:06:59,348
Stay in formation. Targets just ahead.

951
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,643
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

952
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:08,691
You'll have to decide.

953
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:12,361
Stay in formation. Targets just ahead.

954
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:15,614
Target should be clear
if you go in low enough.

955
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:20,911
You'll have to decide.

956
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:27,209
Oh, rats!

957
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,461
Lost number four.

958
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,131
What happened, Ted?
What went wrong?

959
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,926
The oil pressure.
I forgot to check the oil pressure.

960
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,221
When Kramer hears about this,
the shit's gonna hit the fan.

961
01:07:41,683 --> 01:07:44,560
Watch that oil temperature.
What the hell's he doing up there?

962
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,270
Striker, that plane can't land itself!

963
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,730
It takes a pilot
who can handle pressure!

964
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,481
Ease off, Rex. He hasn't flown for years.

965
01:07:49,566 --> 01:07:51,567
It's not his fault.
Could happen to any pilot.

966
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,068
It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.

967
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:55,195
Can't push him too hard.
He might break.

968
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,613
Gotta remember
who you're dealing with.

969
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:59,700
Nick, Pete, Jared.
There's a fire in the barn!

970
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:02,911
He's right.

971
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:05,122
I can't take the pressure.

972
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,166
I was crazy to think
I could land this plane.

973
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,169
- But, Ted, you're the only...
- I don't care.

974
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,380
I don't have what it takes.

975
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:17,176
They'd be better off with someone
who'd never flown before.

976
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,521
Bad news. The fog is getting thicker.

977
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,650
And Leon's getting larger!

978
01:08:57,634 --> 01:09:00,844
I know what you're gonna say,
so save your breath.

979
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,974
No. I don't have a thing to say.

980
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,144
You've done the best you could.

981
01:09:09,229 --> 01:09:11,730
You really have. The best you could.

982
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,234
You can't expect to win them all.

983
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:18,654
But I wanna tell you something

984
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,740
I've kept to myself through these years.

985
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,576
I was in the war myself, Medical Corps.

986
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,162
Was on late duty one night

987
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:28,914
when they brought in
a badly wounded pilot

988
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:31,166
from one of the raids.

989
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,335
He could barely talk.

990
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:36,755
He looked up at me and, "Doc," he said,

991
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:41,009
"The odds were against us up there,
but we went in anyway.

992
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,970
"I'm glad.

993
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:45,472
"Captain made the right decision."

994
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,767
That pilot's name was George Zipp.

995
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,272
George Zipp said that?

996
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:58,527
The last thing he said to me,
"Doc," he said.

997
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,820
"Sometime,

998
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:03,365
"when the crew is up against it,

999
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,784
"and the breaks are beating the boys,

1000
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:09,454
"tell them to get out there
and give it all they've got.

1001
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,625
"And win just one for the Zipper.

1002
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:18,380
"I don't know where I'll be then, Doc,"
he said.

1003
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:23,385
"And I won't smell too good,
that's for sure."

1004
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:27,514
Excuse me, Doc.

1005
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,809
I've got a plane to land.

1006
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,236
All right, Striker,
you better stay up there for a bit.

1007
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:43,071
Soon as the fog lifts, we'll bring you in.

1008
01:10:43,156 --> 01:10:44,948
I'll take it, Elaine.

1009
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:54,583
Listen to me, Kramer.

1010
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,544
Dr. Rumack says
the sick people are in critical condition,

1011
01:10:57,629 --> 01:10:58,962
and every minute counts.

1012
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:00,756
We've got to land now.

1013
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:02,507
Don't be a fool, Striker.

1014
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,967
You know what a landing
like this means.

1015
01:11:04,052 --> 01:11:05,177
You more than anybody.

1016
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,845
I'm ordering you to stay up there!

1017
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,056
No dice, Chicago.

1018
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,059
I'm giving the orders,
and we're coming in.

1019
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,854
I guess the foot's
on the other hand now, isn't it, Kramer?

1020
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,233
He'll never make it in this soup.
Never, not one chance in a million.

1021
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:24,112
I know, I know. But it's his ship now.
His command. He's in charge.

1022
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,908
He's the boss, head man,
top dog, big cheese,

1023
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:31,787
- the head honcho, number...
- Captain, look at this!

1024
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:34,289
"Passengers certain to die."

1025
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:36,625
"Airline negligent."

1026
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:38,877
There's a sale at Penney's!

1027
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,715
All right,
I'll need three men up in the tower.

1028
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,175
You, Neubauer. You, Macias.

1029
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,344
Me, John, big tree.

1030
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,598
Stand by, Striker.
We're going to the tower. Good luck.

1031
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:53,016
We're going to the tower.

1032
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,185
The tower! The tower!

1033
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,479
Rapunzel! Rapunzel!

1034
01:12:02,235 --> 01:12:03,485
Stewardess?

1035
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:04,987
How soon do we land?

1036
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,781
Oh, it won't be long now.
Try not to worry.

1037
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,130
We're all ready, sir.

1038
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,507
This is Captain McCroskey.
This is Captain Roberts.

1039
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,509
Captain Kramer,
this is Captain Colosimo.

1040
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,553
Captain Hinshaw, this is Captain Gatz.

1041
01:12:29,637 --> 01:12:31,179
Captain Kramer, Captain Gatz.

1042
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:33,348
Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.

1043
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,517
All right, Colosimo, you work the relay.

1044
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:37,811
Roberts, check all air traffic
within 5 miles.

1045
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:39,855
Get that finger out of your ear.

1046
01:12:39,939 --> 01:12:41,273
You don't know
where that finger's been.

1047
01:12:43,943 --> 01:12:44,943
Steve?

1048
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,863
- Got a cigarette, Nelson?
- Now, Linda.

1049
01:12:47,947 --> 01:12:50,407
Your husband and the others are alive,
but unconscious.

1050
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:52,325
Just like Gerald Ford.

1051
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:54,453
Now, there's a chance
that we can save them

1052
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:56,997
if Striker can get
that plane down in time.

1053
01:12:57,081 --> 01:13:00,167
- That isn't much of a chance, is it?
- I don't know, Linda, I don't know.

1054
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:03,545
But we'll do everything we can.
Now excuse me, yeah?

1055
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:09,468
Where did you get that dress? It's awful!

1056
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:12,387
And those shoes, and that coat. Jesus!

1057
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:20,395
8 miles. Turn right to heading 044.

1058
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:25,984
We're now at 2, 000 feet,
beginning our descent.

1059
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,194
Steve.

1060
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,196
I want every light you can get
poured onto that field.

1061
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,530
Being done right now.

1062
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:38,163
Tower to all emergency vehicles.
Runway is niner.

1063
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:42,167
Airport vehicles
take positions one and two.

1064
01:13:42,502 --> 01:13:44,544
Civilian equipment, number three.

1065
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:49,132
Air Force, positions
number four and five.

1066
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:51,718
All ambulances, go to number three.

1067
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,055
Air Israel, please clear the runway.

1068
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,022
In a moment, we'll ask you
to assume crash positions.

1069
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:06,358
Your life jackets
are located under your seat.

1070
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,819
Place the jacket over your head,

1071
01:14:08,903 --> 01:14:12,864
and when I give the word,
pull the cord on the right-side flap.

1072
01:14:13,783 --> 01:14:16,243
- Isn't that cute?
- Your seat cushions are also equipped

1073
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,869
with a floatation device.

1074
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:22,791
WZAZ in Chicago,
where disco lives forever.

1075
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,297
Watch your altitude, Striker.
You're too erratic.

1076
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,299
You can't come straight in.

1077
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,135
You've got enough fuel left
for two hours of flying.

1078
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,512
I'll take it, Elaine.

1079
01:14:35,596 --> 01:14:37,264
Listen to me, Kramer.

1080
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:41,309
We have people up here who will die
in less than an hour, let alone two.

1081
01:14:41,394 --> 01:14:44,062
I may bend your precious airplane,
but I'll get it down.

1082
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,439
I'm putting the landing gear down now.

1083
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:49,317
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.

1084
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:50,777
Thanks, Randy.

1085
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:54,072
You better leave, sweetheart.
You might get hurt up here.

1086
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:04,875
Ted?

1087
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,252
Yes?

1088
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:10,589
I wanted you to know, now,

1089
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,175
I'm very proud.

1090
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,432
Tell them the gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

1091
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:27,022
The gear is down,
and we're ready to land.

1092
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,400
All right, he's on final now.

1093
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:33,195
Put out all runway lights, except niner.

1094
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:38,450
Captain, maybe we ought
to turn on the searchlights now.

1095
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:40,535
No.

1096
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,539
That's just what
they'll be expecting us to do.

1097
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,672
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1098
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:58,178
All right, now just listen carefully.

1099
01:15:58,262 --> 01:16:00,472
You should be able to see the runway
at 300 feet.

1100
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,058
Aim the touch down
a third of the way along.

1101
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:06,561
There's a slight crosswind
from the right, so be ready for it.

1102
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:09,147
Land too fast,
use your emergency brakes.

1103
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,274
Red handle's right in front of you.

1104
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,485
If that doesn't stop you...

1105
01:16:18,866 --> 01:16:21,159
If that doesn't stop you,
cut the four ignition switches

1106
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:22,661
over the copilot's head.

1107
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,083
Do you see us now?

1108
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:30,752
You should be able
to see the field, now.

1109
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,804
- Sure is quiet out there.
- Yeah, too quiet.

1110
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:46,768
Looks like I picked the wrong week
to quit sniffing glue.

1111
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,740
There it is.

1112
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:04,244
There he is!

1113
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,707
Striker, you're coming in too fast!

1114
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:10,667
I know! I know!

1115
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,419
He knows! He knows!

1116
01:17:13,421 --> 01:17:14,504
Wow.

1117
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,716
He's below 700 now, still going down.

1118
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,303
675, 650, 625. He's holding.

1119
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:23,680
He's holding. He's at...
No, no. He's down, he's down.

1120
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,890
Sound your alarm bell, now!

1121
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:30,395
All right, now, everybody,
get in crash positions.

1122
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,777
Put down 30 degrees of flap!

1123
01:17:41,615 --> 01:17:42,824
Striker, now listen to me.

1124
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,534
Remember your brakes and switches!

1125
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,286
Get ready to flare it out!

1126
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,663
He's all over the place.

1127
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:51,207
900 feet up to 1300 feet.

1128
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,709
What an asshole.

1129
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:55,545
Hold up, harder! Put down more flap!

1130
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,385
Just kidding.

1131
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:06,973
Striker, lift your nose.
Straighten your wings!

1132
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,185
Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.

1133
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,228
He's coming right at us!

1134
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,734
Coming in too hot!

1135
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,028
Ease up on the throttle!

1136
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,405
Watch for that crosswind. Level it out.

1137
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,991
Aim for the numbers.
You'll have to dip your left wing.

1138
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,165
You're drifting. Keep your eyes
on the far end of the runway.

1139
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,378
You're too low, damn it!

1140
01:18:38,089 --> 01:18:39,964
Watch your stall speed.

1141
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:44,803
Flare out!

1142
01:18:47,306 --> 01:18:49,224
Now ease her down! Down!

1143
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,189
The brake! Pull the red handle!

1144
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:05,490
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1145
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:15,166
Flight 209 now arriving, Gate 8.

1146
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:17,502
Gate 9.

1147
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:19,587
Gate 10.

1148
01:19:20,339 --> 01:19:22,590
Pull on a lever. Push a button!

1149
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,141
Gate 13.

1150
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,851
Gate 14.

1151
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,310
Gate 15.

1152
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,407
Auntie Em, Uncle Henry, Toto!
It's a twister! It's a twister!

1153
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:51,161
Gate 23.

1154
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:52,245
24.

1155
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,538
25.

1156
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:20,607
I just wanna tell you both, good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1157
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,614
Striker?

1158
01:20:27,698 --> 01:20:30,033
- Striker, you all right?
- Yeah.

1159
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,118
We're okay.

1160
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:35,038
Ted, that was probably
the lousiest landing

1161
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,457
in the history of this airport.

1162
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,168
But some of us here, particularly me,

1163
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:44,255
would like to buy you a drink
and shake your hand.

1164
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:52,430
And, Ted, I just want you to know
that when the going got rough...

1165
01:20:54,433 --> 01:20:56,893
Okay, all right. Have a nice day.

1166
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:58,728
Okay. Have a nice day.

1167
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,813
Thank you for flying Trans American.

1168
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:04,192
Loneliness, that's the bottom line.

1169
01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:06,861
I was never happy as a child.

1170
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,905
Christmas, Ted,
what does that mean to you?

1171
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,573
To me, it was a living hell.

1172
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,910
Do you know what it's like
to fall in the mud and get kicked,

1173
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,329
in the head, by an iron boot?

1174
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:20,208
Of course you don't.
No one does. That never happens.

1175
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,460
I'm sorry, Ted.
That's a dumb question. Skip that.

1176
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,797
Hurry, hurry.

1177
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:28,967
Okay, folks. There you go.

1178
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,635
Have a nice day.

1179
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:48,653
Municipal bonds, Ted.
I'm talking double-A rating.

1180
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,113
The best investment in America.

1181
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:25,406
Well, I'll give him another 20 minutes.

1182
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,782
But that's it.

1182
