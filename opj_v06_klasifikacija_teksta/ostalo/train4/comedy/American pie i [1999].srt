1
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:32,143
Ohh,
you're so good.

2
00:00:32,178 --> 00:00:35,443
Ohh, yes.
I am the best, baby.

3
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:37,881
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh. Oh, that was a tit.

4
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,351
That is a tit! Yes!

5
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,388
Oh, you're so big!

6
00:00:42,455 --> 00:00:45,253
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that's right, baby.

7
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:47,520
- Oh, doggie wants to hide his bone.
- Yes!

8
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:49,755
Oh, yeah!
I'm bone smugglin', baby.

9
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:51,922
Man, would you shut up!

10
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,432
Hey, Jimmy.
Just wanted to say sweet dreams.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,434
Yeah, yeah.
Sweet dreams. Good night, Mom.

12
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:59,767
Kiss good night.

13
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:03,070
- Something wrong with the reception?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

14
00:01:03,142 --> 00:01:05,770
- There's... There's this nature
show that I'm trying to watch. - Take it off.

15
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:09,713
- And the birds are all scrambled and I can't even...
- Do me! Yes!

16
00:01:09,782 --> 00:01:12,774
Baby! Ride me like a pony!

17
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:16,288
- The thing must be broken or I
sat on the remote or something.

18
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,790
- Getting ready for bed, son?
- Yup, I'm all set, Dad. I'm all set.

19
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:21,952
- Yeah?
- No! No, I think he's tried to watch some illegal channels.

20
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,997
- Illegal... Illegal channels?
- This is just bad reception, honey.

21
00:01:25,064 --> 00:01:27,055
- Oh, spank my hairy ass!
- What's that?

22
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:30,967
- Ooh, baby!
- You know what? Here. Just give me this, please...

23
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,835
- Oh, my God!
- And let's get this... Ohh!

24
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:37,638
Okay, okay. Let's, uh... What the hell's
the matter with this thing?

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,010
Yes!

26
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:39,443
Yes!

27
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:53,056
Illegal channels?
Shit!

28
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:55,458
If there's any channel that should be illegal, it's
that "all-woman's" channel.

29
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:59,362
- Lifetime supply of pantyhose or some shit.
- Yeah.

30
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,798
Hey, uh, did you see The Little Mermaid
on TV the other night?

31
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,860
- No.
- Ariel, man. She's so hot!

32
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:08,896
- Yeah, Oz. But not when she's on land.
- She's a mermaid, dude.

33
00:02:08,975 --> 00:02:12,809
Come on, Vicky, it's Stifler's
party. We got to go. It'll be great.

34
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,646
Why? All that happens at Stifler's parties
is people get drunk and do it.

35
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,651
Yeah.

36
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:20,653
Now, come on, Kevin.
Open it.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,019
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
You got in.

38
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,251
If you think so,
just open it.

39
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:28,294
Fine.

40
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,167
Hmm.

41
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:38,965
"Dear Miss Latham: We're sorry but
after keeping you on the waiting list...

42
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:42,530
for the past couple of months, we've
decided that you are now rejected."

43
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:44,599
Shut up!

44
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:49,512
- You got in.
- Yes! I love you!

45
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:52,107
Okay.

46
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:01,219
Hey, you think I should wear
this shirt to Stifler's party?

47
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,819
You've worn that shirt for,
like, three days in a row, man!

48
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:05,921
Guys.
She said it.

49
00:03:05,998 --> 00:03:08,398
- Said what?
- She said she loves me.

50
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,732
- Holy shit, dude! The "L" word?
- Oh, man!

51
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:13,203
Cornell's not
that far from "U" of "M."

52
00:03:13,272 --> 00:03:15,206
Yeah, it's only,
like, seven hours.

53
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,242
Oh, and you get
to drive across Canada.

54
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,804
- Beautiful country.
- Whatever. It's doable.

55
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,577
Wh-What we should
do today, in band.

56
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:28,484
Instead of playing our instruments regularly,
we should play them backwards.

57
00:03:28,554 --> 00:03:30,818
- That'll be so funny!
- Yeah.

58
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:39,554
No offense, but you're talking about a post-high school,
long-distance relationship.

59
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,624
And you and Kevin
haven't even done it yet.

60
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,828
That's not why
we're going out.

61
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:47,428
What do you expect him to drive
to Cornell for? Milk and cookies?

62
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,669
We're gonna have sex
when he's ready and I'm ready.

63
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,835
It's got to be
completely perfect.

64
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:55,005
I want the right time, the right moment,
the right place...

65
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,845
Vicky, it's not
a space shuttle launch. It's sex.

66
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:04,153
- Finch.
- Here's the man we are looking for.

67
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:05,271
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?

68
00:04:05,306 --> 00:04:06,320
- Gentlemen.
- What's goin' on, buddy?

69
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:09,793
- Same ol'...
- Finch. You got the Latin homework?

70
00:04:09,862 --> 00:04:15,528
Oh.

71
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:18,126
It means, "My dog ate it."
It's Latin. It's a joke.

72
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:22,538
- It's a Latin joke.
- Yeah, Latin. Just drink your coffee.

73
00:04:22,609 --> 00:04:24,906
- No, Jim, it's mochaccino.
- What?

74
00:04:24,977 --> 00:04:27,468
What I'm drinking, it's mochaccino.
It's not coffee.

75
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:29,538
'Nova!

76
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:31,675
What's up, dude?

77
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,912
You comin' to the party
tonight, Ozzie, you fuckface?

78
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:36,386
Uh, depends if my date
wants to stop by.

79
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:39,620
- I'm workin' on somethin' new.
- I got an idea about something new.

80
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,024
How about you guys
actually locate your dicks,

81
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,961
remove the shrink-wrap
and fucking use them!

82
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:48,831
Dude, it's gonna happen.
She's a college chick.

83
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:51,335
Oh, right.
I'll see you guys tonight.

84
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:54,965
I'll look for you in the no-fucking
section.

85
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:02,336
All right. I'm shooting for a
9:00 E.T.A. Beer in hand by five after.

86
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:04,646
Breath check.

87
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:09,518
Thank you.

88
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,797
- I wish you wouldn't do that.
- So, you got something up your sleeve for tonight?

89
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:21,698
This is a foolproof plan,
my friend.

90
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,792
I have a serious question
to ask you guys. Okay.

91
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,533
You know Nadia the Czechoslovakian
chick? She might be there tonight.

92
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,837
Now, do you think she would prefer...

93
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:33,646
Laid-back Jim...

94
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,409
or...

95
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:39,280
Cool, hip Jim?

96
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,377
I don't think it really matters
with that shirt you're wearing.

97
00:05:41,454 --> 00:05:44,787
What? Correct me if I'm wrong but
you're the one with the girlfriend...

98
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:46,848
and you're still
stranded on third base.

99
00:05:46,926 --> 00:05:49,623
Hey, at least I know what
third base feels like, okay?

100
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,220
- You're still just a batboy.
- Batboy. Batboy.

101
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,232
What are you talking about?

102
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,098
Guys, uh...

103
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,434
What exactly does
third base feel like?

104
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:02,474
You wanna
take this one?

105
00:06:03,644 --> 00:06:08,046
- Like warm apple pie.
- Yeah? - Yeah.

106
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:11,413
- Apple pie, huh?
- Uh-huh.

107
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,180
McDonald's or homemade?

108
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:17,882
Gentlemen,
destiny awaits.

109
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,458
That's number five and six
for the Stif-meister!

110
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,127
Yeah.

111
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,329
Oops!

112
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:35,238
- Holy!
- H-Hey!

113
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:38,971
Nadia! Buenos días.
Glad you could make it.

114
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:41,980
I'll be back for you later.

115
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,211
- Another party sultan!
- How ya doin'?

116
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:52,314
Welcome to Stifler's
Palace of Love, fellas.

117
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:55,623
- The keg's back there! Enjoy!
- Yeah.

118
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:59,062
Vicky, Jessica! Great to see you.
Glad you could make it.

119
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:01,395
Haha, bitches!

120
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,458
- Sherman!
- Hey!

121
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:06,027
What the fuck
are you doin' here?

122
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:10,940
Fellas!
What's goin' on?

123
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,305
Fellas!
What's goin' on?

124
00:07:12,378 --> 00:07:15,745
Sherman. Not much. Just, uh,
scopin' the babes.

125
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:19,410
- Indeed! Some fine ladies here, boys.
- Uh-huh.

126
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:23,012
Confidence is high.
Repeat. Confidence is high.

127
00:07:23,089 --> 00:07:25,489
Sherman is movin'
to DEFCON 2.

128
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:28,925
- Full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
- Hey!

129
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:31,122
You have somethin'
goin' tonight, Sherman?

130
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:33,324
You see that
Central chick, Bernette?

131
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,060
- Um, no.
- No.

132
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:38,433
She's around.
Seems she's taken a liking to me.

133
00:07:39,872 --> 00:07:43,239
Fellas, it's time
she experienced... the Shermanator.

134
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:45,608
Yeah, okay,
Sherman. Whatever.

135
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:49,739
I'm a sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

136
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:53,342
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

137
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,855
- Go get 'em, tiger.
I'll be back!

138
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,993
- Hopeless.
- Completely.

139
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,119
- Hi.
- Hey, Vic.

140
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:06,096
Oh, shit.
Guys... Guys...

141
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:09,794
There's Nadia and
she just looked at me.

142
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,497
- She just looked at me.
- Well, why don't you go talk to her?

143
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:16,132
Yeah.

144
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,699
Yeah, you're right, Kev.
I should just go talk to her.

145
00:08:20,813 --> 00:08:22,747
Yeah,
I could do that. Sure.

146
00:08:22,815 --> 00:08:26,842
Sure.

147
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,855
Kev? Kev? Ke...

148
00:08:39,298 --> 00:08:42,062
Yeah. Yeah.

149
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:07,587
- That's great!

150
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:23,742
See ya later.

151
00:09:32,017 --> 00:09:34,680
We're here for the party.

152
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:37,780
What party?
There's no party.

153
00:09:42,094 --> 00:09:46,588
Weird.
Try the house down the street.

154
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,462
So, what's your major?

155
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,598
Post-modern feminist thought.

156
00:09:55,675 --> 00:09:59,041
Oh, cool.
Great night, isn't it?

157
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:02,308
Sure.

158
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:07,785
Yeah, it's just somethin' about the
springtime that's just cool, you know?

159
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:12,290
- Like the smell of fresh rain or somethin'.
- Mmm.

160
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,657
Suck me, beautiful.

161
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,218
What did you just say?

162
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:21,029
Suck me, beautiful.

163
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:26,299
My friends call me "'Nova,"
as in Casanova.

164
00:10:26,372 --> 00:10:28,671
That's pathetic.

165
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,241
Jeez, you don't
have to laugh at me.

166
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,302
Well, there's just some things
you need to learn, that's all.

167
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,679
- Like what?
- Well, you've got to tone it down.

168
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:38,979
You don't need to come
to a place like Lookout Point...

169
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:42,020
and spout off
cheeseball lines to be romantic.

170
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:45,352
- Okay.
- You have to pay attention to a girl.

171
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:49,554
Be sensitive to her feelings.
Relationships are reciprocal.

172
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,860
Come on, Casanova.
I'll take you back to your friends.

173
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:03,366
Vicky, think it's time to take
the next step in our relationship?

174
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:07,173
- Tonight?
- Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.

175
00:11:07,246 --> 00:11:09,681
I mean, it's how you've
always pictured it, isn't it?

176
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:11,943
Damn, my parts fuckin' stink!

177
00:11:12,017 --> 00:11:15,919
Dude, you gotta take
a shit! You smell like a Yeti!

178
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:18,855
Or not.

179
00:11:18,924 --> 00:11:21,688
Just relax.

180
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,728
You actually
said that?

181
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,963
Shut up!

182
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,061
You did a hell of a lot better
than I did with Nadia.

183
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:36,107
Oh, thanks, Jim, that's great.
That's really reassuring.

184
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:38,667
Hey, no problem,
'Nova.

185
00:11:38,744 --> 00:11:42,681
Hey, don't call me 'Nova anymore.
I'm a... I'm a fraud.

186
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:45,182
You guys
are pathetic.

187
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:48,152
I'm gonna find myself
a little hottie.

188
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,917
"Suck me, beautiful"!

189
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,490
- Let me know.
- Okay.

190
00:11:59,565 --> 00:12:01,931
Keep going.

191
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:04,492
I should be able
to talk to girls.

192
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,902
I'm articulate.

193
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,270
You know, I got a 720
on my S.A.T. Verbal.

194
00:12:09,341 --> 00:12:11,536
Bullshit.
There's no way.

195
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:15,512
I kid you not, man.
Look. Listen.

196
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:19,950
- Copious. Verisimilitude.
- Mmm.

197
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:23,045
Oh, ohh. Now.

198
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:27,114
Ohh.

199
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:35,366
Suck me,
beautiful!

200
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:38,267
- Damn it, Stifler.
- Checkout time!

201
00:12:38,337 --> 00:12:43,640
- Please, vacate the room.
- You are such a jerk.

202
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:51,282
God, I can't believe how many
cool people are at this party.

203
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,650
Yup.

204
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,018
And you got
a keg too!

205
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,922
- Wow!
- Indeed.

206
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:08,062
Oh, wait.
I left my beer downstairs.

207
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:10,567
No. No.
Here, babe!

208
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:13,571
Thanks.

209
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,699
You're really
beautiful. Oh...

210
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:20,370
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

211
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,987
You know what? I don't know
if I want to be doing this.

212
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:42,830
- Doing what?
- You know, like, if we hook up tonight,

213
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,802
tomorrow I'll just be some girl
you go telling all your friends about.

214
00:13:45,871 --> 00:13:49,272
No way!

215
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:52,276
Steve, you could at least look at me
when you say that!

216
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:56,974
Look. Sarah,

217
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:01,008
I... I wouldn't go telling
stories or anything about you.

218
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:05,649
I promise.
So, just... relax,

219
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:09,956
take it slow... and
let the good times roll.

220
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:15,696
- Okay.
- All right.

221
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,405
What's wrong?

222
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,673
What's wrong?
What is it?

223
00:14:31,383 --> 00:14:35,820
Xenophobic.

224
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:40,291
Oh!

225
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:43,260
- Regurgitation.
- I know that one.

226
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:47,864
- Kevin likes it.
- He likes getting head.

227
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:50,458
Gee, what a total shocker.
What about you, Vicky?

228
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,697
I mean, h-have you just
never had one with Kevin...

229
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:54,739
or have you never
had one, period?

230
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:57,173
I've had one.

231
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:59,437
- I think.
- Okay.

232
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:03,379
That's a no. No wonder
you're not psyched about sex.

233
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,383
You tell me you never
even had one manually?

234
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:08,716
- I've never tried it.
- You've never double-clicked your mouse?

235
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:11,922
Ha-ha, nice!

236
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,653
- Jesus! Stifler, how much
did you drink, man?

237
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:18,685
Hey, Stifler?
How's the pale ale?

238
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:22,530
- Fuck you!
- Ooh, whoo!

239
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:26,728
- That's Stifler's mom?
- Yup.

240
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:31,799
Shit. I cannot believe a fine woman
like this produced a guy like Stifler.

241
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:35,779
- Dude, that chick's a "MILF."
- What the hell is that?

242
00:15:35,848 --> 00:15:40,012
- M-I-L-F... Mom I'd like to fuck.
- Yeah, dude!

243
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:42,144
Oh-ho, yeah!

244
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:45,281
- Yeah! MILF! MILF!
- Hey, guys... Guys. Guys.

245
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:48,690
- Come here.
- Sherman, what's goin' on?

246
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,220
Yeah, uh... Don't you think you fellas
could try a little tact?

247
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:58,065
I got company,
if you know what I mean?

248
00:15:59,571 --> 00:16:02,131
She's hot!

249
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:09,642
If Sherman has sex before I do,
I'm gonna be really pissed.

250
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:14,778
Sherman?
The Shermanator?

251
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:18,311
Come on, man.

252
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,855
MILF! MILF!

253
00:16:21,927 --> 00:16:26,193
MILF! MILF! Dude, hey, dude.
What are you doin' to her, dude?

254
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,633
Oh, my God,
bro, dude.

255
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:32,966
Enough of this blow job bullshit.

256
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:36,701
- I gotta get laid already.
- That's nice. Really, really nice.

257
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:40,541
- Can I have a ride?
- Sure.

258
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:44,104
- Vicky, wait.
- Not for you.

259
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:48,552
Yeti!
I am the Yeti!

260
00:16:56,261 --> 00:16:58,855
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Finch.

261
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:02,867
Where were you last night, huh? What happened to that
foolproof plan of yours?

262
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:06,029
Well, I was going for a fashionably-late
entrance and I was too late.

263
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:08,971
So,
no ladies left.

264
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,566
It was a very
special night, very special.

265
00:17:11,644 --> 00:17:14,271
Guys. Guys.

266
00:17:16,582 --> 00:17:20,644
- I'll never forget this.
- Oh, I'll never forget it, either.

267
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:25,179
- Thank you.
- Uhh.

268
00:17:25,257 --> 00:17:29,353
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

269
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,362
Bye.

270
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,057
Fellas, say good-bye
to Chuck Sherman, the boy.

271
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:39,797
I... am now a man.

272
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:42,567
I highly recommend
you join the club.

273
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:48,045
We were doin' the wild thing...
all night. I'm exhausted.

274
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:51,173
I don't get it. I mean,
how the hell did you do that?

275
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,949
It was just my time.
It was just my time.

276
00:17:57,389 --> 00:17:59,755
Best of luck
to you boys.

277
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:05,226
- I cannot believe this.
- Come on, guys.

278
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:08,027
You know, we should
be happy for Sherman.

279
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,628
No, we shouldn't be.

280
00:18:11,703 --> 00:18:14,639
You know, I put in months
of quality time with Vicky.

281
00:18:14,706 --> 00:18:17,368
Sherman meets a chick
for one night and scores.

282
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:20,138
- This is just wrong.
- No shit.

283
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:23,704
How the hell am I supposed
to become Mr. Sensitive Man?

284
00:18:23,782 --> 00:18:27,479
You know, we're all gonna go to college
as virgins. You realize this, right?

285
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:29,986
I mean, they probably have special dorms
for people like us.

286
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:34,788
All right. I got an idea.
But it's got to stay between us.

287
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,351
It's really simple. We just
got to make an agreement.

288
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:39,762
Er, nah. It's...
It's more than an agreement.

289
00:18:39,831 --> 00:18:41,992
- What? A bet?
- A pact.

290
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,399
No money involved.
More important than any bet.

291
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:48,303
Here's the deal.
We all get laid before we graduate.

292
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:52,835
Dude, it's not like I haven't
been trying to get laid.

293
00:18:52,911 --> 00:18:55,709
Think about when you work out, Oz.
You gotta have someone there, right?

294
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,341
Someone to spot you.
Someone to keep you motivated.

295
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,851
Well, that's exactly what
we can do for each other.

296
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,650
I mean, we'll be there
to keep each other on track.

297
00:19:03,722 --> 00:19:06,020
Separately, we are flawed
and vulnerable, but together,

298
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:08,252
we are the masters
of our sexual destiny.

299
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:10,261
Their tiger-style
kung fu is strong.

300
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,263
But our dragon-style
will defeat it.

301
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,892
- Guys!
- The Shaolin masters from East and West must unite!

302
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,527
- Fight, and find out who is number one.
- Guys!

303
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:23,370
Come on. You're ruining my moment here.
This is our very manhood at stake.

304
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:26,036
We must make
a stand, here and now.

305
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,837
No longer will our penises
remain flaccid and unused!

306
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:35,012
We will fight for every man out there
who isn't getting laid and should be.

307
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:38,545
This is our day.
This is our time.

308
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:42,992
And, by God, we will not stand by and
watch history condemn us into celibacy.

309
00:19:43,061 --> 00:19:45,052
- Amen. Yes.
- I like that.

310
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,032
- We will make a stand. We will succeed.
- 'Bout time!

311
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:51,695
- We will get laid!
- Yeah! - Yeah!

312
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:57,230
Now, the sex: It's got
to be valid, consensual sex.

313
00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:00,710
- No prostitutes.
That's what you're thinkin', Finch.

314
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,270
Busted.

315
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:06,044
So, basically,
prom is our last chance.

316
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,211
- Oh, dude. Prom sucks.
- I know,

317
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:10,413
but you gotta think
about it this way.

318
00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:14,391
I mean, all the parties afterwards?
The chicks are going to want to do it.

319
00:20:14,459 --> 00:20:18,486
- Yeah-yeah, he's right. It's, like tradition or something.
- The Rose Bowl.

320
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:22,795
- So, that gives us...
- Exactly three weeks to the day.

321
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:28,130
- We're gonna do this.
- All right, to the next step! - Next step!

322
00:20:28,206 --> 00:20:28,772
Next step!

323
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:30,639
Next step!

324
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:21,153
- Well, did you get the flowers?

325
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:51,719
Don't worry. You'll
get her back soon enough.

326
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,088
- You think so?
- Sure, she likes you.

327
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,238
- Well, I like her too.
- Do you love her?

328
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:56,318
- Well, I like her too.
- Do you love her?

329
00:21:56,394 --> 00:22:00,353
Um, you know what?
You can't really ask me that.

330
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:03,424
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, I mean,
just tell her you love her.

331
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:06,437
- That's how I was duped.
- Look, Jessica,

332
00:22:06,505 --> 00:22:08,633
I- I don't want
to dupe her.

333
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:12,268
All right.
What you need to do...

334
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,539
is learn how to press
a girl's buttons.

335
00:22:14,614 --> 00:22:16,547
You have to give her
what she's never had.

336
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:20,016
- What's that?
- Let me give you a hint.

337
00:22:20,085 --> 00:22:24,112
Ohh, Kev! Uhh. Yeah.

338
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:27,317
- ? Comprende?
- You mean an orgasm.

339
00:22:27,392 --> 00:22:29,623
- You got it, stud!
- Well, you know,

340
00:22:29,694 --> 00:22:31,855
I'm-I'm pretty sure that I've...
given her a...

341
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,889
- No, you haven't.
- Well, there was one time...

342
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:39,459
- No.
- Oh, man.

343
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:44,407
- Look, kid, it's up to you. The big "L" or the big "O."
- Dickhead!

344
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:47,843
- You gotta see this.

345
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:01,652
- What did you cocks do to him?

346
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:11,195
Great.
See you next time.

347
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,943
- Hey, guys. Came to watch me in action?
- Yeah.

348
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:21,673
- I-I think you sounded pretty good.
- Yeah, man.

349
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:23,681
I think you need
your balls reattached.

350
00:23:23,748 --> 00:23:27,275
- Hey, keep it down, dude.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

351
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:29,411
This place
is an untapped resource.

352
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,512
I mean,
check it out.

353
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,186
- These vocal jazz girls are hot.
- Why the hell is he joining jazz choir so late?

354
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:39,958
- Maybe he's preparing for
another senior year at East?

355
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:44,092
You guys,
we don't even know him.

356
00:23:46,104 --> 00:23:48,038
You dipshit!

357
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:50,199
You're expecting
to score with some...

358
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:52,209
goody-goody
choirgirl priss?

359
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:56,373
These chicks don't know me. I can work
the sensitive angle here, fellas!

360
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:58,679
You know, it's just like
that college chick told me.

361
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,810
All that you gotta do
is just ask 'em questions...

362
00:24:01,886 --> 00:24:03,854
and listen to what
they have to say and shit.

363
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:08,256
I don't know, man.
That sounds like a lot of work!

364
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:13,460
Uh, just a second!

365
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,530
Come in. Come in.

366
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:22,631
Oh, Jim, you're here.

367
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:26,667
Uh, I was just walking
by your room and uh...

368
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:30,772
And, you know, I was thinking, "Boy,
it's been a long time since we've had...

369
00:24:30,849 --> 00:24:33,249
a little
father-son, uh-uh, chat."

370
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,681
Oh! I almost forgot.
I, uh, I bought some magazines.

371
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:41,988
Do you just want to flip
to the center section?

372
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,753
Well, this is the...
this is the, uh, female form.

373
00:24:46,831 --> 00:24:49,823
And they have
focused on the breasts,

374
00:24:49,901 --> 00:24:54,669
uh, which are used primarily
to, uh, feed young infants...

375
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:59,403
- and, uh... and also, uh, in foreplay.
- Right.

376
00:24:59,477 --> 00:25:02,844
This is, uh...
This is Hustler.

377
00:25:02,914 --> 00:25:06,646
And this is a much
more exotic magazine.

378
00:25:06,718 --> 00:25:11,553
Now, they have decided to focus
on the, uh, pubic region...

379
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:15,457
- Right. Uh-huh.
- The whole groin area.

380
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:19,327
Look at the expression on her face.
You see that? See what's she's doing?

381
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:22,457
She's kind of looking
right into your eyes saying,

382
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:26,368
"Hey, big boy.
Hey, how ya doin'?"

383
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:30,238
- You see?
- Right.

384
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:34,404
Shaved is a magazine
I'm not too familiar with,

385
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:38,745
- but, again,
if you flip to the center...

386
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,251
Section...

387
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:45,620
Well, you see the detail that, uh,
that they go into in this picture here.

388
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,353
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- It almost looks like a tropical plant or something...

389
00:25:49,427 --> 00:25:51,361
- underwater... thing.
- Yeah. Yes.

390
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:53,727
- Do you know what a clitoris is?
- Oh, my God.

391
00:25:53,798 --> 00:25:55,993
- Well, don't say, "Oh..."
- Yes, I know what a clitoris is.

392
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,194
Oh, you do. Oh, I see. Yes, you do.
I forgot you've been there and back.

393
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:00,203
- You know everything...
- I've learned about it in Sex Ed...

394
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:03,240
- I really don't need you to talk about clitoris.
- I'm trying to make this painless...

395
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:05,970
- You know what? I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry.
- No-no-no.

396
00:26:06,044 --> 00:26:09,480
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:11,515
I shouldn't
have got hot there.

398
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:13,813
Well, you know what
I'm going to do, Jim.

399
00:26:13,885 --> 00:26:15,819
I'm going to just
leave these books here...

400
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:19,414
for you to, uh, peruse at your, uh...
at your leisure.

401
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:23,454
Wait!

402
00:26:27,232 --> 00:26:29,393
Well, safer
than a tube sock.

403
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:35,428
- Okay, that... That was good.
- Yeah.

404
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:40,934
- See you at dinner.
- Uh, yeah. I'll see you at dinner.

405
00:26:41,012 --> 00:26:43,708
So, Finch,
this is your plan?

406
00:26:43,782 --> 00:26:47,218
You know, I don't think girls are
into the whole mini-golf thing.

407
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:49,344
Kevin, I'm sure
that they're not.

408
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,117
Actually, there is one small matter that
I need to ask for your cooperation in.

409
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:56,217
- In the spirit of this whole pact, you know?
- Sure, what do you need?

410
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:59,491
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
And tell all the boys the same thing.

411
00:26:59,564 --> 00:27:03,432
Look, I gotta go.
Sixteen minutes round-trip.

412
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:06,299
You know, Finch,
it's... it's senior year.

413
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,737
I mean, don't you think it's time you
learned how to take a dump at school?

414
00:27:08,807 --> 00:27:12,140
When was the last time you looked
at the facilities in this school?

415
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:21,280
Excuse me.

416
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:23,843
Uh, that's
Paul Finch, right?

417
00:27:23,922 --> 00:27:26,686
- Yeah.
- Well, you've seen him in the locker room, right?

418
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:31,821
- Uh, yeah.
- So, my friends, they want to know. Is it true?

419
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:34,661
You know,
that he's... equipped.

420
00:27:34,732 --> 00:27:38,862
I have no idea. Finch showers
with his bathing suit on.

421
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,371
I mean, uh...

422
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:44,704
As a matter of fact, it is true.
The guy's huge!

423
00:27:44,776 --> 00:27:47,870
- Does he have a date for the prom yet?
- No, definitely not.

424
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:50,005
All right. Thanks.

425
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:53,748
Oh, man!

426
00:27:53,918 --> 00:27:58,981
So I was thinking maybe you could
give me some advice, brother to brother.

427
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:01,719
I thought you might know a trick
or somethin' to make her...

428
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:06,230
- Orgasm?
- Yeah. - What's good here?

429
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:08,595
- Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
- What?

430
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:12,466
- How do you do that?
- Hey, never mind that. Listen, pay attention.

431
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:15,802
Is that all that you're interested in,
tryin' to get your girl into bed?

432
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:19,139
No, it'd be good to be able
to, you know, return the favor.

433
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:21,645
Be nice to know she enjoys
things as much as I do.

434
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:24,978
See that? That's good. That's what
I wanted to hear. Now, you qualify.

435
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:31,545
- Qualify for what?
- My man, you've just inherited the Bible.

436
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:34,080
It originally started
as a sex manual,

437
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:37,583
this book that some guys
brought back from Amsterdam.

438
00:28:37,663 --> 00:28:40,256
And each year it got passed on to one
East student who was worthy.

439
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:44,529
Now, it's full of all sorts of stuff
that guys have added over the years.

440
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:52,205
But you have to keep it a secret
and return it at the end of the year.

441
00:28:52,277 --> 00:28:56,304
All right.
So now you know. Good luck.

442
00:29:33,284 --> 00:29:35,617
What was that?

443
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:38,247
- Uh, sorry.
- No, it was good.

444
00:29:40,692 --> 00:29:44,128
Well, it, uh...
It came from the heart.

445
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:48,154
Well, keep it coming.
All right, people, good work!

446
00:29:48,232 --> 00:29:50,894
Now, don't forget. The state
competition's a couple of weeks away,

447
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:54,132
so keep on it, okay?

448
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:06,645
Not bad, Chris.

449
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:08,982
Really?

450
00:30:10,054 --> 00:30:12,420
Thanks, uh,
Heather, right?

451
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,424
Yeah.

452
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:17,017
So, you've got this sort of
Frank Sinatra thing going on.

453
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:21,759
Right. I feel like I've
discovered this whole new side of me.

454
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,324
I mean, uh,
music is so expressive.

455
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:28,065
Okay.
I mean, I agree, but...

456
00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:31,199
aren't you supposed to be out,
like, trying to decapitate someone...

457
00:30:31,275 --> 00:30:35,268
- with your lacrosse stick or something?
- Oh, sure. Sure.

458
00:30:35,346 --> 00:30:37,439
You know, I know what
people think. It's like,

459
00:30:37,515 --> 00:30:40,575
"Oz, he's just this
kick-ass lacrosse player."

460
00:30:40,652 --> 00:30:43,347
You know, I also play football,
by the way, but that's, like,

461
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:46,788
- that's not all that I am, you know?
- Of course, I didn't...

462
00:30:46,858 --> 00:30:50,817
I mean, it really bothers me when
people try to pigeonhole me like that.

463
00:30:50,895 --> 00:30:52,863
You?

464
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,797
You think
I don't get that?

465
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:59,234
God, it's like just because I don't
get drunk and barf every weekend...

466
00:30:59,303 --> 00:31:03,569
that people say, "Oh, look. There's
this Goody Two-Shoes choirgirl priss."

467
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:07,975
Yeah. So, like,
what else do you do?

468
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:11,379
Well,
the same things you do,

469
00:31:11,449 --> 00:31:14,418
like hang out
with friends and stuff.

470
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:16,919
- Why? What do you think I do?
- Oh, I...

471
00:31:16,988 --> 00:31:19,980
I just realized that I don't
know anything about you.

472
00:31:20,058 --> 00:31:25,223
- I was interested.
- Oh, well, what do you want to know?

473
00:31:25,296 --> 00:31:28,163
You know,
stuff... about you.

474
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:33,069
All right.

475
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:37,632
Mom, I'm home!

476
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:36,289
Oh, yeah. Oh!

477
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:44,167
- Jim!
- It's not what it looks like.

478
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,612
Well, we'll just tell your
mother that, uh... that, uh...

479
00:32:52,683 --> 00:32:54,810
we ate it all.

480
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:37,759
Goal by number eight, Chris Ostreicher.

481
00:33:41,699 --> 00:33:43,724
- Nice game.
- Nice game. Good game.

482
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:50,507
Hey, what are
you doin' here?

483
00:33:50,575 --> 00:33:54,011
Just enjoying my first exhilarating
lacrosse experience.

484
00:33:54,078 --> 00:33:56,639
- You kicked butt.
- Oh, thanks.

485
00:33:56,714 --> 00:33:59,706
- Um, Chris...
- Oh, you can call me Oz, if you want.

486
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:02,150
- Do I have to?
- You can call me Ostreicher.

487
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,381
- What's your middle name?
- Nah, forget it.

488
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:08,016
- Come on. I won't tell anyone.
- Well, neither will I.

489
00:34:08,092 --> 00:34:11,721
Okay. Um.

490
00:34:11,796 --> 00:34:15,323
So, I had this thought and...

491
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,664
It may seem like
it's way out of left field.

492
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:22,331
I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with
anybody, I thought that maybe...

493
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:25,068
Those guys sucked ass!

494
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:27,337
Choir chick, what the hell
are you doing here?

495
00:34:27,411 --> 00:34:32,178
Well, uh, I was
asking Chris to prom.

496
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,241
So, do you
want to go?

497
00:34:34,318 --> 00:34:37,776
Oh, yeah!
That would be great.

498
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:41,120
Well, just don't
expect Oz to pay for the limo!

499
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:44,252
Stifler, fuck!
I mean...

500
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:48,822
Why do you got to be so
insensitive all the time?

501
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:52,232
What?

502
00:34:52,303 --> 00:34:55,704
Whatever. Look, uh, don't forget.
My cottage after prom.

503
00:34:55,773 --> 00:34:58,207
On Lake Michigan.

504
00:34:58,276 --> 00:35:00,767
Hey, wait up, you pussies.
Where you goin'?

505
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:06,215
Ah, well, I gotta...
I gotta hit the showers now,

506
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:09,618
but I think this is gonna
be really, really good.

507
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:13,624
- Yeah. Me too.
- All right.

508
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:16,489
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

509
00:35:21,198 --> 00:35:25,362
- 'Appenin' Oz!
- Working with the choir chick?

510
00:35:25,436 --> 00:35:29,031
What d'ya say, fellas? I just dig
those cute little sweaters she wears.

511
00:35:29,106 --> 00:35:33,338
Nuts you do, you little horn dog.

512
00:35:33,411 --> 00:35:35,971
Yeah!
Yeah, baby!

513
00:35:36,047 --> 00:35:40,074
Spank me! Spank me!
Hit that high "C."

514
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:47,652
Come on!
What's goin' on here?

515
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:55,463
I was being selfish
and majorly insensitive.

516
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,434
I'm a... I'm a total idiot.
I mean, a fool, a buffoon.

517
00:35:58,502 --> 00:36:01,027
I think shithead
really says it.

518
00:36:01,105 --> 00:36:03,321
You know what? You're right. I'm a shithead, and
I want to make it up to you.

519
00:36:03,356 --> 00:36:05,537
You know what? You're right. I'm a shithead, and
I want to make it up to you.

520
00:36:05,576 --> 00:36:07,092
Oh, yeah? How?

521
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:08,609
Oh, yeah? How?

522
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,649
- Oh. Oh. Oh. Ohh!

523
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:14,378
- Vicky. Shh. Your parents are downstairs.

524
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:17,683
- Kevin, don't stop!
- Just a second.

525
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:35,833
- Hon, can you tell Vic to come on down for supper?

526
00:36:35,906 --> 00:36:41,742
- Holy shit!
- Shh. You know there's no lock on your door?

527
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:50,447
Ohh! I'm coming!
I'm coming!

528
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:57,089
- Oh, Jim!
- Dad.

529
00:36:57,161 --> 00:37:00,460
Hi, I was just looking
at the old family portrait out here.

530
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:03,193
Well, that was
a fun day wasn't it?

531
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:05,702
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

532
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,069
Jim, I want to talk
about masturbation.

533
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,607
Now, I just want you to know that
it's-it's a perfectly normal, uh, thing.

534
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,840
And I have
to admit, uh, you know.

535
00:37:16,915 --> 00:37:21,374
I did a fair bit of masturbating
when I was a little younger.

536
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:25,581
- I, uh... I used to call it
"stroking the salami."

537
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:28,284
Yeah, you know,
"pounding the ol' pud."

538
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:31,021
I never did it
with baked goods.

539
00:37:31,094 --> 00:37:35,554
But you know your Uncle Mort?
He "pinched the one-eyed snake" five, six times a day.

540
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:39,831
See, it's like, uh,
practice for the big game.

541
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:43,032
You see?
It's like... It's like...

542
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:46,008
banging a tennis ball
against a brick wall.

543
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:50,036
Which can be fun.
It can be fun, but it's not a game.

544
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:52,947
- Right. No.
- It's not a game.

545
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:56,452
What you want is you want
a partner to return the ball.

546
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,081
- Do you want a partner?
- Yeah. Yeah-Yeah, I want a partner.

547
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:02,058
- You do want a partner?
- Oh, I want a partner.

548
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:06,152
- Want a partner. Good. Good.
- Of course.

549
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,130
Good.

550
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:12,693
So, once Hal becomes king,
he has to take on...

551
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,135
the responsibilities of leadership
and turn his back...

552
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:17,503
on his old,
drunken friend, Falstaff.

553
00:38:17,574 --> 00:38:22,273
You see, Hal is going through a...
rite of passage, much like you all are.

554
00:38:22,346 --> 00:38:26,214
So make most of the time you've got
left together. You'll miss it later.

555
00:38:26,283 --> 00:38:28,912
So, does your tongue cramp up?

556
00:38:28,987 --> 00:38:33,082
- Nah. You get kind of dizzy, though.
- Wow.

557
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:37,059
That's amazing. She's probably
gonna want to do it soon.

558
00:38:38,362 --> 00:38:42,298
All right. Class dismissed.

559
00:38:44,769 --> 00:38:49,364
Still questing after the Holy Grail,
huh, guys?

560
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,801
Hey, uh,
where's Finch?

561
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:56,938
Oh, he went home to take a shit.

562
00:38:57,015 --> 00:38:58,983
I don't get it.
I just don't.

563
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,883
How does a guy like that
get this sudden reputation?

564
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:05,388
- What reputation?
- Observe.

565
00:39:05,455 --> 00:39:09,448
Ex-Excuse me.
Do you know who Paul Finch is?

566
00:39:09,526 --> 00:39:12,894
Yeah! He's the guy
with the tattoo, right?

567
00:39:12,964 --> 00:39:18,732
- You know, the eagle and the
blazing fire and that stuff.

568
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:22,568
Well, um, if you guys see him later,
will you tell him Courtney says hi?

569
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,074
Bye.

570
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:29,169
Okay. Explain.

571
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:32,181
I can't. I don't
know how he's doing it.

572
00:39:32,249 --> 00:39:35,548
I, uh... I guess that
just leaves Jim trailing.

573
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,815
- Aw, Jimbo!
- Better sack up, buddy!

574
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:40,016
Yeah, I know.
I'm working on it, all right?

575
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:42,217
James?

576
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:44,260
You are very good
in the world history class, yes?

577
00:39:44,328 --> 00:39:48,424
Me? Y-Yes. No, uh...

578
00:39:48,498 --> 00:39:51,935
- Yes, I am.
- Perhaps you could help me with my studies.

579
00:39:52,003 --> 00:39:54,163
Uh, yeah. Absolutely.

580
00:39:54,237 --> 00:39:56,262
Tha-Tha-Tha... That would be...
That would be great sometime.

581
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,903
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, I have ballet practice.

582
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:04,141
Perhaps I could come
by your house afterwards?

583
00:40:04,214 --> 00:40:06,478
I could change
clothes at your place.

584
00:40:08,085 --> 00:40:11,852
Oh. Uh... yeah.

585
00:40:11,923 --> 00:40:15,916
I suppose that
would be okay. Sure.

586
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:26,432
Nice car!

587
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:28,938
- I'm glad you think so.
- You don't like it?

588
00:40:29,007 --> 00:40:32,373
No, I like the car.
By the way, though, about prom?

589
00:40:32,442 --> 00:40:35,411
That was a bad idea.
I'm sorry I invited you.

590
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:38,471
- What are you talkin' about?
- Please.

591
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:42,109
I asked you because I thought you might
actually be worth going with.

592
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:45,849
But you are just a jock.
No, wait. You're a jerk.

593
00:40:45,923 --> 00:40:48,858
Wait!
I don't understand.

594
00:40:48,926 --> 00:40:52,258
I saw you making fun of me
with your lacrosse buddies.

595
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:54,490
Heather, I wasn't
makin' fun of you.

596
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,124
Gimme a break.
You're so full of it.

597
00:41:00,337 --> 00:41:05,434
Fuck me! There's gonna be an Eastern
European chick naked in your house.

598
00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:07,637
And you're not gonna
do anything about that?

599
00:41:07,712 --> 00:41:11,511
What am I gonna do, huh?
Broadcast her over the Internet?

600
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:15,040
- Yeah.
- You can do that?

601
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:22,619
No. I cannot do that to her.

602
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:26,093
Jim, get some fuckin' balls.

603
00:41:26,163 --> 00:41:30,965
If you don't have the guts to photograph a naked chick,
how you gonna sleep with one?

604
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:33,697
I don't like the kid,
but he's got a point.

605
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:37,002
See, even shit-brick
knows you should do it.

606
00:41:37,075 --> 00:41:40,602
All you gotta do is set up some sort of
private link or whatever on the 'Net...

607
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:42,669
and tell me the address.

608
00:41:42,747 --> 00:41:45,544
You can send me
the address too.

609
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:48,550
I'll save
you a seat.

610
00:42:09,473 --> 00:42:13,843
Okay, that was good, but
I want to thicken-up that solo.

611
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,174
Michigan State is this Saturday,
and I want that part to smoke.

612
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:18,510
Yeah, I know,
my timing's off.

613
00:42:18,582 --> 00:42:22,279
No, it's not that. I think it'll
work better as a duet with a tenor part.

614
00:42:22,352 --> 00:42:24,320
I'll do it.

615
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:28,022
- Dick.
- I'll do it.

616
00:42:28,091 --> 00:42:30,355
Great.
See you tomorrow.

617
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:34,462
Hmph.

618
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,397
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause I want to.

619
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,838
Yeah? Well,
you can't fake this.

620
00:42:43,908 --> 00:42:47,036
You better practice.

621
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,380
Come in.

622
00:43:01,091 --> 00:43:05,688
Jim? There's a, uh...
a young lady here to see you.

623
00:43:05,763 --> 00:43:08,027
- Hey, Nadia.
- Hi, James. Ready to study?

624
00:43:08,098 --> 00:43:10,829
Oh, he's always ready to study.
He's a real bookworm, this kid.

625
00:43:10,902 --> 00:43:14,393
- Dad.
- That means... He's not-not one of those nerdy guys but...

626
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:19,340
- Dad!
- Well, I'll... I'll let you two hit the books.

627
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:26,506
You want a beer?

628
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:30,383
- Oh, there we go.
- Come on, move!

629
00:43:30,453 --> 00:43:34,514
Steve! It's my computer!
And I wanna use it!

630
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:36,582
Shut up!

631
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,322
Oh, you need to...
You need to change, right?

632
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:42,025
- Uhh, do you mind?
- No. N-No, not at all.

633
00:43:42,098 --> 00:43:45,967
Uh, please, you know.
Just go ahead and get un... get changed.

634
00:43:46,037 --> 00:43:49,437
I'll, uh... I'll
go downstairs and start studying up.

635
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:51,337
- Yeah.
- Okay.

636
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:54,138
- Oh...
- All right, there he goes.

637
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:55,460
Now,
we're in business.

638
00:43:55,495 --> 00:43:56,711
Now,
we're in business.

639
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:00,978
- Back in a sec.
- Jimmy, honey, wh...

640
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:25,596
- Ah, here she is.

641
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:30,906
- Did I miss anything?
- No. You are just in time.

642
00:44:30,982 --> 00:44:34,417
- Oh. Ohh!
- This is incredible.

643
00:44:34,484 --> 00:44:37,214
Oh, my God!
This is too much.

644
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:40,279
Oh, did you see?
Oh, there that goes. Oh, geez.

645
00:44:40,357 --> 00:44:42,724
God bless
the Internet.

646
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:45,819
- Ai-yi-yi.
- Do it. Take it off.

647
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:48,261
- Oh, my God.
- Ohhh!

648
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:51,062
Oh, thank you, God,
for this wonderful, wonderful day.

649
00:44:51,134 --> 00:44:55,366
- She takes her vitamins.

650
00:44:57,808 --> 00:44:59,742
Stop hyperventilating.

651
00:45:04,782 --> 00:45:09,411
This is, like,
the coolest thing I've ever seen.

652
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:12,820
I know.

653
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,585
Can you believe... This is definitely
one of Stifler's best ideas ever.

654
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,253
What is she...
She's touching my stuff.

655
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:21,992
- Why is she touching my stuff?
- Man, let her touch.

656
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:25,228
- She's going through my stuff!
- Nadia can touch anything she wants.

657
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,739
- Oh.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

658
00:45:34,812 --> 00:45:37,302
- No, no.
- Oh, nice collection there, Jim.

659
00:45:37,347 --> 00:45:40,010
She's gonna leave.
She's definitely gonna...

660
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,746
She's getting comfortable.
She's not gonna leave.

661
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,515
She reads
the articles.

662
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:00,700
Is she?

663
00:46:00,771 --> 00:46:04,832
She's goin' downstairs.

664
00:46:13,516 --> 00:46:17,817
- Oh, my God!
- Jackpot, baby!

665
00:46:17,888 --> 00:46:21,186
- Can you believe this?
- Nadia, I would have never known.

666
00:46:21,257 --> 00:46:24,056
I have an announcement
that I would like to make.

667
00:46:24,127 --> 00:46:27,996
There is a gorgeous woman...
masturbating on my bed!

668
00:46:28,065 --> 00:46:33,502
- Thank you, Nadia!
- If you ever had a chance with Nadia, this is it.

669
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,098
- What am I supposed to do, Kev?
- Seduce her.

670
00:46:38,174 --> 00:46:41,268
Wha... What the hell
would I say?

671
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:44,712
Go over there and ask her
if she needs an extra hand.

672
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:48,718
- That's stupid, Kev. I can't...
- That's not stupid! You're stupid if you don't go!

673
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:50,754
Come on!
Get over there!

674
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:53,084
- Get goin', man. She's prime.
- Get out of here!

675
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:56,489
- She's waitin' for you.
- Okay, all right. I'm goin'.

676
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:58,584
- Go!
- Go! - I'm goin'!

677
00:46:58,662 --> 00:47:00,595
- Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Oh, shit.

678
00:47:20,525 --> 00:47:22,459
- Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

679
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,298
Oh, boy. Oh, God.
Oh, crap. Oh, no.

680
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:34,738
Hello?

681
00:47:34,807 --> 00:47:38,537
- Looks like Jim addressed the e-mail wrong.
- What?

682
00:47:38,611 --> 00:47:41,876
It went out to every mailbox
in the East High directory.

683
00:47:41,947 --> 00:47:43,938
God, how juvenile.

684
00:47:44,016 --> 00:47:45,950
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

685
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:50,546
- Check this out! Oh, my God! Wow!

686
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:55,152
Oh.

687
00:47:55,628 --> 00:48:00,428
Please, God,
let this be it.

688
00:48:00,498 --> 00:48:02,523
Please?

689
00:48:06,504 --> 00:48:11,135
S- Somebody's goin' in there.

690
00:48:12,577 --> 00:48:14,876
Here you go.
That's what you need to do.

691
00:48:14,947 --> 00:48:17,040
- That guy's in my trig class.
- Oh, no.

692
00:48:19,652 --> 00:48:23,144
- Looks like you could use an extra hand.
- Jim!

693
00:48:23,222 --> 00:48:26,123
- Well... Oh, God.
- Shame on you.

694
00:48:26,192 --> 00:48:28,386
Yeah, shame on me.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

695
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,895
- Uh, you know, I'm just gonna go.
- Well,

696
00:48:30,963 --> 00:48:34,295
you have seen me.

697
00:48:34,365 --> 00:48:37,459
Now, it's
my turn to see you.

698
00:48:39,004 --> 00:48:42,039
Strip!

699
00:48:42,074 --> 00:48:44,507
- Strip?
- Slowly.

700
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:48,741
Uh, you mean,
like, strip strip?

701
00:48:48,814 --> 00:48:51,942
For me.

702
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:54,144
What is he
talkin' to her about?

703
00:48:54,219 --> 00:48:59,088
- Uh, no idea.
- Come on, Jim. People are viewing. Get to business.

704
00:49:02,327 --> 00:49:04,853
Perfect!

705
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:08,387
- Move, James! Move!
- Yeah, yeah. Move.

706
00:49:16,474 --> 00:49:19,069
Go, trig boy! It's yer birthday!

707
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:31,780
- No! No. No.
- Please, God.

708
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:34,256
What's going on?

709
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,224
- Yes!
- All right. Get in the mix!

710
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,564
- See there.
- Oh, okay.

711
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:51,710
- This is disgusting.
- What the fuck is this?

712
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:55,376
Cut it out, man!

713
00:50:00,085 --> 00:50:02,178
Yeah.

714
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:16,296
Freak.

715
00:50:20,538 --> 00:50:22,700
Did not just
take out that chair.

716
00:50:22,775 --> 00:50:26,768
- Yup, he took out the chair.
- More, more, you bad boy!

717
00:50:26,846 --> 00:50:30,873
Oh, yeah, I'm naughty. I'm naughty,
baby. Hyah!

718
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:34,407
Ohh, God!

719
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:40,716
- Now,

720
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:43,192
come to me.

721
00:50:43,261 --> 00:50:45,890
Oh, yeah.

722
00:50:52,772 --> 00:50:54,797
- Here we go.
- He's in, man.

723
00:50:54,874 --> 00:50:56,705
- This just got a hell of a lot better.

724
00:50:56,776 --> 00:51:00,803
- Be gentle.
- Okay.

725
00:51:02,514 --> 00:51:05,075
- Uh...

726
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,380
- Oh.

727
00:51:10,022 --> 00:51:11,887
Jim?

728
00:51:11,957 --> 00:51:16,621
- Oh! Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

729
00:51:16,695 --> 00:51:19,823
- Oh. Ohh!
- Liftoff aborted.

730
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:22,868
- Houston, we have a problem.
- Oh... Uhh...

731
00:51:22,935 --> 00:51:26,335
What happened? What did he do

732
00:51:26,404 --> 00:51:28,372
He blew it.

733
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,875
I guess
I'll be going now.

734
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:36,505
No, no, no, I'm... I'm not done, Nadia.
I've, uh... I've got reserves.

735
00:51:36,581 --> 00:51:39,345
Nadia, please, please.
I'm begging you.

736
00:51:39,417 --> 00:51:42,250
Well, I do like
your dirty magazines.

737
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,657
You do? Okay. Well. Um.
Did-Did... Did you see this one?

738
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:52,389
This here is your... is your more,
uh, exotic, risque magazine.

739
00:51:52,464 --> 00:51:54,455
- He's pullin' out the porn.
- He's desperate.

740
00:51:54,532 --> 00:51:56,466
Jim, just wait
till she leaves.

741
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:59,128
Very arousing women.
They arouse me...

742
00:51:59,204 --> 00:52:01,172
They arouse me
very, very much.

743
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:05,141
But, uh...
But not as arousing as you.

744
00:52:05,243 --> 00:52:09,179
- Oh, Jim!
- Oh, God!

745
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:17,212
Yes!

746
00:52:17,288 --> 00:52:19,415
He's ruining daisy!
Whoo!

747
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:26,554
So, uh, "shaved"
is the expression?

748
00:52:29,635 --> 00:52:31,568
Holy shit.

749
00:52:31,637 --> 00:52:34,834
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

750
00:52:34,907 --> 00:52:37,568
- H-H-Holy shit!
- Touch me, Jim.

751
00:52:40,045 --> 00:52:42,137
Here.

752
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:45,615
Oh. Oh.

753
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:48,117
- Again?
- Not again.

754
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:51,417
- Not again, man!
- Is that possible?

755
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:52,737
What a loser.

756
00:52:52,772 --> 00:52:53,984
What a loser.

757
00:52:57,595 --> 00:52:59,085
Hey!

758
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:45,042
- Hey, minute man!
- Shut up.

759
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:47,044
You know... You know you're
supposed to be supportive.

760
00:53:47,111 --> 00:53:51,411
Hey, you think you still
got a chance with Nadia?

761
00:53:51,482 --> 00:53:54,646
No. Her sponsors here
saw the thing on the 'Net.

762
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,654
I-I really don't
think they liked it.

763
00:53:56,722 --> 00:53:58,883
How do
you know that?

764
00:53:58,958 --> 00:54:01,017
She's already on a plane back home.

765
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:03,083
Yeah.

766
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:06,928
You know, guys? Maybe I'm just
not good with girls, period.

767
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:10,525
No-no-no, really-really. Like... Like I
was born without that part of the brain.

768
00:54:10,603 --> 00:54:12,764
I mean, I can't
talk to girls.

769
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:14,863
And when I do talk
to them, I screw it up.

770
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,034
Yeah, well, come prom those excuses
aren't going to do you any good.

771
00:54:19,544 --> 00:54:23,503
And one time at band camp,

772
00:54:23,581 --> 00:54:25,777
we weren't supposed
to have pillow fights,

773
00:54:25,851 --> 00:54:28,911
but we had a pillow fight,
and it was so much fun.

774
00:54:28,988 --> 00:54:33,982
A- And this one time, we all lost our music and we were
supposed to play this song,

775
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:39,325
but we didn't know it, so we just made
it up and we kept playing and playing,

776
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:43,356
and the conductor didn't know
what we were doing, and it was so funny.

777
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:45,869
So, you're pissed about somethin', huh.

778
00:54:45,938 --> 00:54:47,872
You know what
I do when I'm angry?

779
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,102
I just play some Bach on my flute.
It's so relaxing.

780
00:54:51,175 --> 00:54:54,372
- I learned to do that at band camp.
- Hold on, uh...

781
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:57,813
You have no idea
why I'm angry?

782
00:54:57,883 --> 00:55:01,046
Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
Sometimes I get cranky...

783
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,384
- when I know I have
a big test to study for.

784
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:08,790
- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- I thought so...

785
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:11,556
- because this one time at band camp...
- W-What's your name?

786
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,494
- Michelle.
- O-Okay.

787
00:55:13,564 --> 00:55:15,555
Michelle, um...

788
00:55:15,634 --> 00:55:18,431
Do you want to be
my date for the prom?

789
00:55:18,503 --> 00:55:21,905
Really? You seriously
want to go with me?

790
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:28,605
Yes. Seriously.

791
00:55:28,681 --> 00:55:32,275
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?
Because that would be so cool.

792
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:37,687
- Sure, whatever you want.
- Cool! We're gonna have such a good time.

793
00:55:37,756 --> 00:55:42,921
It'll be like this one time at band camp
when we all had a campfire...

794
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:00,737
Hi.

795
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:04,441
- How'd you know I was here?
- Stifler told me.

796
00:56:04,515 --> 00:56:07,917
- Talked to Stifler?
- Well, I needed to find you.

797
00:56:07,986 --> 00:56:10,112
We're gonna have
to work on that song.

798
00:56:11,322 --> 00:56:14,257
Okay.
I'm glad you came by.

799
00:56:14,325 --> 00:56:16,555
So you work nights?

800
00:56:18,864 --> 00:56:21,697
- My dad's the manager.
- Really?

801
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:24,827
Cool. Tell him
the subs are great.

802
00:56:26,905 --> 00:56:29,806
- So you're going to Michigan next year?
- Yeah.

803
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:32,605
My parents want me to go
to Northwestern, but...

804
00:56:32,678 --> 00:56:35,544
I don't wanna write all those
extra essays they make you do.

805
00:56:35,614 --> 00:56:41,415
I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally
significant moment" was?

806
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:46,049
So when my "U" of "M" acceptance came in
December, I just said the hell with it.

807
00:56:46,124 --> 00:56:48,149
- Onions?
- What?

808
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:50,752
You, uh, want onions?

809
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:52,763
Oh, no, thank you.

810
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:58,127
So what are you
gonna major in?

811
00:56:58,202 --> 00:57:02,263
State's got a good business school, and I could probably
walk-on to the lacrosse team.

812
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,242
Well, you've probably got it
pretty figured out, then, huh?

813
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,940
I mean, business is okay,
and lacrosse is awesome, but...

814
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:13,108
what am I gonna be,
a professional lacrosse player?

815
00:57:13,184 --> 00:57:15,118
I really have no idea.

816
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:18,519
Thank God.
I thought I was the only one.

817
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:20,523
Well, you're not.

818
00:57:21,994 --> 00:57:24,019
So we're gonna be
close next year.

819
00:57:32,004 --> 00:57:33,938
You mean East Lansing
and Ann Arbor?

820
00:57:34,006 --> 00:57:37,338
Yeah.

821
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:39,341
What are you
talkin' about?

822
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:43,437
I can't go to the prom with you.
I'm holding out for someone else.

823
00:57:43,514 --> 00:57:45,710
You gotta be fuckin' kidding me.

824
00:57:45,784 --> 00:57:50,152
I know it's a long shot, but I figure
Paul Finch might ask me.

825
00:57:50,221 --> 00:57:54,248
Finch.
Shit-brick.

826
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:57,022
Oh, gosh.
I-I forgot.

827
00:57:57,094 --> 00:57:59,528
You look okay.

828
00:57:59,597 --> 00:58:03,056
I-I mean, the scars
healed really well.

829
00:58:03,134 --> 00:58:05,069
- Hey, Stifler.
- Eat shit.

830
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:09,874
What was that
all about?

831
00:58:09,942 --> 00:58:14,344
- He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.
- Who told you that?

832
00:58:14,412 --> 00:58:16,573
What do you mean,
"no comment"?

833
00:58:16,648 --> 00:58:19,708
- Did you two hook up or something?
- What, are you kidding? No.

834
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:23,345
Then how did all this
get started?

835
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:26,653
Well, I guess it's all right
for me to tell you now.

836
00:58:26,725 --> 00:58:29,922
That reputation of his isn't
going anywhere. Cheese, please.

837
00:58:29,995 --> 00:58:32,964
Finch comes up to me
and says, "Jessica,

838
00:58:33,031 --> 00:58:35,659
I need your help with this,
blah, blah, etcetera."

839
00:58:35,734 --> 00:58:38,099
So I said, "All right.
Pay me 200 bucks,

840
00:58:38,169 --> 00:58:41,037
and I'll tell a couple of girls
that you're dynamite in bed."

841
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:43,870
So he did,
and I did.

842
00:58:43,942 --> 00:58:46,035
- That actually works?
- Well, duh! Of course.

843
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:48,601
Naturally, I embellished
a little bit.

844
00:58:48,647 --> 00:58:51,171
Did you hear that Finch had
an affair with an older woman?

845
00:58:51,249 --> 00:58:53,183
No, I didn't hear that one.

846
00:58:53,251 --> 00:58:55,846
That one was my favorite.

847
00:58:55,921 --> 00:58:57,912
Do that cheerleader.

848
00:58:57,990 --> 00:59:01,516
- She wants me. She calls me up...

849
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,258
Oh, my God,
you're gay!

850
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,267
Sing it with me.
You know the words.

851
00:59:11,335 --> 00:59:14,566
No, thanks, man. You've been
singin' that shit all week.

852
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,336
If you try that at M.S.U.
This Saturday, I'll kick your ass.

853
00:59:18,409 --> 00:59:20,400
Our last game
is this Saturday.

854
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:22,606
Yeah, well, shit.

855
00:59:25,549 --> 00:59:29,611
I've got this lacrosse game. It's
really important. It's our last game.

856
00:59:29,688 --> 00:59:33,453
Central almost beat us last time, so
this time I really wanna kick their ass.

857
00:59:33,524 --> 00:59:36,254
But it's gonna be cool,
because the game's at State,

858
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:38,888
which means afterwards
I'll be able to stop by.

859
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:40,955
So you can't sing
at the competition.

860
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:43,763
Heather, I'm sorry.
I totally blew it.

861
00:59:43,835 --> 00:59:48,567
It's okay. You should...
do what makes you happy.

862
00:59:50,174 --> 00:59:53,906
All right. Listen,
thanks for understanding.

863
00:59:53,979 --> 00:59:56,469
Yeah.

864
00:59:56,514 --> 00:59:59,574
So, uh, I guess
I'll see you later?

865
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:02,175
Mm-hmm.

866
01:00:14,332 --> 01:00:17,529
Hey, Kevin.

867
01:00:17,601 --> 01:00:22,595
- You seen shit-brick lately?
- Why? What did you do to him?

868
01:00:22,674 --> 01:00:24,767
Me? Nothing.

869
01:00:24,843 --> 01:00:27,140
See, I'm the one
whose ass he kicked.

870
01:00:27,211 --> 01:00:30,670
But, uh, I'll tell you
one thing, though.

871
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:33,980
I don't think he's gonna have a problem
shitting in school anymore.

872
01:00:34,052 --> 01:00:36,043
Slipped a little something
into his mochaccino.

873
01:00:38,522 --> 01:00:41,184
Oh, God!

874
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:44,386
Oh! Oh!

875
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:52,900
Jesus.

876
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:55,495
Right this way,
sir.

877
01:01:00,946 --> 01:01:04,814
Oh, God.

878
01:01:32,644 --> 01:01:35,636
Oh, no.

879
01:01:36,014 --> 01:01:38,174
It's gonna be fun.

880
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:40,810
You know it's just gonna be
some crappy band and stupid decorations.

881
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:44,514
 You're just saying that because prom's a week away
and you don't have a date.

882
01:01:44,588 --> 01:01:47,080
No, no, no.
I don't want a date.

883
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:51,619
Finch is goin' stag and... so am I.

884
01:01:51,696 --> 01:01:54,961
God, he's like so...
refined.

885
01:01:55,033 --> 01:01:58,195
- You think that
older woman thing is true?

886
01:01:58,269 --> 01:02:01,568
Yeah, it's true.
It was Stifler's mom.

887
01:02:03,642 --> 01:02:06,975
Joanie, was that you?

888
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:09,342
- Oh!
- Can't hold it.

889
01:02:09,413 --> 01:02:12,439
Oh!

890
01:02:16,387 --> 01:02:18,480
Eww!

891
01:02:41,145 --> 01:02:45,411
Yeah!

892
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:48,452
Kev?
I think we've come...

893
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:52,114
- a really long way since homecoming.
- Yeah, we have.

894
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:54,123
Maybe it's time...

895
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:58,150
we start to express ourselves
in new ways.

896
01:02:58,229 --> 01:03:00,493
- Yeah.
- You wanna do it?

897
01:03:00,564 --> 01:03:03,362
- Yeah.
- I love you.

898
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:07,698
It's your turn.

899
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:11,206
That's not
what I was thinking.

900
01:03:11,275 --> 01:03:15,336
Sex. It's always
about sex.

901
01:03:15,412 --> 01:03:18,506
It's not
always about sex.

902
01:03:18,582 --> 01:03:21,643
I just thought it was
about sex this time.

903
01:03:25,023 --> 01:03:29,356
Look, Vicky, love is a term
that gets thrown around,

904
01:03:29,426 --> 01:03:31,394
and-and people
don't mean it.

905
01:03:31,462 --> 01:03:34,660
When I say it, I want it
to be more than words.

906
01:03:34,733 --> 01:03:37,462
- You know? I want it to be...
- Perfect.

907
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,504
Exactly.

908
01:03:41,673 --> 01:03:44,402
- Okay, Albert. You ready?
- No problemo.

909
01:03:49,648 --> 01:03:51,980
Come on, Heather.
Work with me here.

910
01:03:57,488 --> 01:04:00,252
Goal, Ostreicher!

911
01:04:00,324 --> 01:04:04,022
- All right, Oz!
- Atta boy, Ozzie!

912
01:04:04,094 --> 01:04:06,029
Whoo!
Yeah, baby!

913
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:08,725
- We're crushing you losers!
- Let's go, fellas!

914
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,825
Come on!
Whoo-hoo!

915
01:04:17,174 --> 01:04:19,199
Focus on the music.
Think melody.

916
01:04:19,276 --> 01:04:22,370
- Let the music be my guide.
- That would be a start.

917
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:35,055
Who's the man?
Stifler!

918
01:04:38,362 --> 01:04:40,455
Huddle up, guys! Huddle up!

919
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:51,976
Huddle up!
Come on! Okay.

920
01:04:52,043 --> 01:04:53,943
All right, all right!

921
01:04:54,012 --> 01:04:56,241
- Good hustle, guys.
- Good hustle.

922
01:04:56,313 --> 01:05:01,307
But you can still lose. You all saw
what happened to Oz out there.

923
01:05:01,385 --> 01:05:06,584
I don't want to ever see any of you
thinking you're gonna score.

924
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:09,855
You don't score
until you score.

925
01:05:09,928 --> 01:05:12,418
- Until you score.
- That's right, baby!

926
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:14,795
It all boils down
to today.

927
01:05:14,866 --> 01:05:18,734
For you seniors,
this marks the culmination...

928
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:21,829
- of the past four years.
- Culmination.

929
01:05:21,906 --> 01:05:26,535
I want you to think about
what this means to you.

930
01:05:26,611 --> 01:05:29,739
Do you guys wanna look back
on your days at East...

931
01:05:29,814 --> 01:05:33,476
and know that you used
the time you had?

932
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:36,246
- Hell, yeah!
- You do!

933
01:05:38,155 --> 01:05:41,522
- Ah! Good attitude, Ostreicher.
- Good luck, fellas.

934
01:05:41,592 --> 01:05:45,084
Christ, I didn't tell ya
to leave the game.

935
01:05:45,162 --> 01:05:47,130
I'm sorry, Coach.

936
01:05:47,197 --> 01:05:50,189
You got someplace more important
to be, Ostreicher?

937
01:05:50,267 --> 01:05:52,531
Yeah.

938
01:05:52,604 --> 01:05:54,765
Ostreicher!

939
01:05:55,707 --> 01:05:59,267
Oz?
Fuckface?

940
01:05:59,343 --> 01:06:02,006
Ostreicher!

941
01:06:27,271 --> 01:06:29,866
- Hey, Oz!
- Ozmeister!

942
01:06:29,941 --> 01:06:31,909
- Oh, great.
- What about the game?

943
01:06:31,976 --> 01:06:35,070
- I'm not playing.
- You're missing the game for us?

944
01:06:35,145 --> 01:06:38,342
No, I'm missing the game
for you.

945
01:06:41,753 --> 01:06:45,483
- D-Does this mean I'm not gonna get to do the duet?
- Albert, you suck.

946
01:06:50,662 --> 01:06:52,595
I don't think
he's comin' back.

947
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:36,771
Yeah, Oz!
You fuckin' rule!

948
01:07:36,841 --> 01:07:39,468
- Fuckin' rule!
- Yeah!

949
01:07:42,046 --> 01:07:44,343
Maybe the words
aren't that important.

950
01:07:44,415 --> 01:07:46,646
It's like, I know he
really cares about me, you know?

951
01:07:46,718 --> 01:07:48,811
Even if he can't
say it, he does.

952
01:07:48,887 --> 01:07:52,823
And yeah, he always talks about sex, but
that's okay, 'cause he's a guy, right?

953
01:07:52,891 --> 01:07:55,484
- He's got a dick. He's a guy.
- Right.

954
01:07:55,559 --> 01:07:57,493
Wait. Is this
translation right?

955
01:07:57,561 --> 01:08:00,530
"Go home, bird teacher.
I've had enough."

956
01:08:00,597 --> 01:08:03,566
I don't know.
I got it from Kevin.

957
01:08:03,635 --> 01:08:07,195
- So, does it hurt?
- What?

958
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:09,968
You know... sex.
Does it hurt?

959
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:14,443
Yeah. I mean, the first time you do it,
you know, it hurts.

960
01:08:14,511 --> 01:08:18,676
But then you, you do it again
and again and again...

961
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:21,981
It just starts to feel good.
Really good.

962
01:08:22,053 --> 01:08:25,079
Okay, so say
I don't do it.

963
01:08:25,155 --> 01:08:29,923
And then I go off to college. I might
end up doing it with some random guy...

964
01:08:29,994 --> 01:08:33,725
- who totally turns out to be a jerk.
- This is true.

965
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:36,493
And I'll wish I would've
done it with Kevin.

966
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:38,832
So go do it with Kevin.

967
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:41,963
- You think?
- Yeah. You're... You're ready.

968
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:46,373
- You're woman. Look at you. You're ready for sex.
- You're right.

969
01:08:46,443 --> 01:08:48,844
- I know.
- I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna have sex.

970
01:08:48,913 --> 01:08:51,540
- Now.
- And it's gonna be right, and it's gonna be just perfect.

971
01:08:51,616 --> 01:08:53,743
- Perfect sex.
- Thanks, Jessica.

972
01:08:53,918 --> 01:08:56,317
Please.

973
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:59,219
Kevin.

974
01:08:59,289 --> 01:09:01,348
Kevin.

975
01:09:02,927 --> 01:09:06,327
- I wanna have sex.
- Now?

976
01:09:11,603 --> 01:09:13,662
Prom.

977
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,771
You must be excited
about the big night tonight.

978
01:09:57,815 --> 01:09:59,976
Thrilled.

979
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:01,584
Who's the lucky girl?

980
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,118
Who's the lucky girl?

981
01:10:03,186 --> 01:10:05,120
Michelle.

982
01:10:05,188 --> 01:10:08,282
- Michelle.
- Yeah.

983
01:10:08,358 --> 01:10:12,522
- She must be very special.
- Oh, she's special, all right.

984
01:10:12,596 --> 01:10:15,588
I'm sure she is special if you
picked her out of the whole bunch.

985
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:21,067
Jim, I'm just gonna
say one thing...

986
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:23,073
before you leave
tonight.

987
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:28,975
I want you to be very,
very careful...

988
01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:31,675
when you're
putting on...

989
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:34,376
the corsage.

990
01:10:37,454 --> 01:10:39,388
Okay, Dad.

991
01:10:39,456 --> 01:10:41,857
- Promise me.
- I promise.

992
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:54,759
You know, at band camp
we have dances like this,

993
01:11:54,832 --> 01:11:57,027
only they're way funner.

994
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:14,914
All right, status check.
Where do you guys stand?

995
01:12:14,986 --> 01:12:18,786
Finch, we know where you are,
but can't really use that as an excuse.

996
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:20,790
Jim?

997
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:25,123
Uh, my date's a flute-toting band dork.
Does that answer your question?

998
01:12:25,195 --> 01:12:28,632
Oz, is this vocal-jazz shit
gonna pay off or what?

999
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,463
Kevin, what's with
the attitude?

1000
01:12:31,535 --> 01:12:34,470
Attitude? Me?

1001
01:12:34,538 --> 01:12:37,200
I think you guys should be
a little more enthusiastic.

1002
01:12:37,274 --> 01:12:39,766
This is the night
we've been waiting for.

1003
01:12:39,811 --> 01:12:41,938
We're in this together.
You guys can't back out.

1004
01:12:42,013 --> 01:12:45,676
Kev, you don't need us to get laid.
Are you afraid or something?

1005
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:49,185
No. Come on.
We made a pact.

1006
01:12:49,252 --> 01:12:52,689
You can't break that.
You guys are gonna have to...

1007
01:12:52,757 --> 01:12:56,590
Have to what, Kev, huh?
I don't have to do shit.

1008
01:12:56,661 --> 01:13:00,062
Forget it already. I am so sick
and tired of all this bullshit pressure.

1009
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:04,898
I've never even had sex, and already,
I can't stand it. I hate sex!

1010
01:13:04,969 --> 01:13:07,938
And I'm not gonna stand around here
busting my balls over something that,

1011
01:13:08,005 --> 01:13:10,370
quite frankly,
isn't that damn important.

1012
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:12,533
I'm gonna go hang out
with that geek over there...

1013
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:15,738
'cause at least she has something else
to talk about besides sex.

1014
01:13:15,813 --> 01:13:17,747
Goddamn.

1015
01:13:19,784 --> 01:13:22,479
Yeah.

1016
01:13:22,552 --> 01:13:25,920
You know, at least I learned
how to shit in school, buddy.

1017
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:27,958
Hey, Finch.

1018
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:30,755
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

1019
01:13:36,133 --> 01:13:39,569
- How come you have no date?
- I like to keep my options open.

1020
01:13:39,637 --> 01:13:41,570
I got something for you.

1021
01:13:43,473 --> 01:13:45,965
Consider it
a consolation prize.

1022
01:13:49,046 --> 01:13:51,981
Jessica, this is great!
Wow!

1023
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:56,417
- Felt sorta guilty about taking your money.
- You spent $200 on this?

1024
01:13:56,486 --> 01:13:59,684
No, I spent 50 on the flask,
<i>150 on the earrings.

1025
01:14:01,826 --> 01:14:03,760
- These are, uh...
- Let me just clarify...

1026
01:14:03,828 --> 01:14:08,264
- that you have no chance of scoring with me, Finch.
- Of course not!

1027
01:14:08,331 --> 01:14:10,926
So I take it you and Sherman
are pretty close, huh?

1028
01:14:11,002 --> 01:14:12,993
You met at that party
a while back, right?

1029
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:15,004
Yeah, we were
up all night together.

1030
01:14:15,072 --> 01:14:18,165
We had one of those
amazingly deep conversations...

1031
01:14:18,241 --> 01:14:21,233
where you feel like
you really get to know someone.

1032
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:24,611
Deep conversation, huh?

1033
01:14:24,682 --> 01:14:26,912
Is that
what you call it?

1034
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:28,952
What else
would I call it?

1035
01:14:35,793 --> 01:14:37,727
Thank you, Great Falls.

1036
01:14:37,795 --> 01:14:40,787
We're gonna take a little break.
You are beautiful.

1037
01:14:45,135 --> 01:14:47,070
You suck!

1038
01:14:49,974 --> 01:14:52,567
Excuse me, everyone.

1039
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:54,804
Sorry to interrupt.

1040
01:14:54,879 --> 01:14:57,244
I just thought
you all should know this.

1041
01:14:57,314 --> 01:14:59,977
Chuck Sherman is a liar.

1042
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:02,348
I never had sex with him.

1043
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:06,823
He's never had sex with anyone.
I know this because he told me.

1044
01:15:06,891 --> 01:15:10,759
Once he tried to screw
a grapefruit, but that's all.

1045
01:15:10,828 --> 01:15:14,160
Oh. He also told me that when he gets
nervous, he sometimes wets his pants.

1046
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:18,531
Thank you for your time.

1047
01:15:30,982 --> 01:15:34,246
- Guess what?
- Not interested.

1048
01:15:34,317 --> 01:15:38,618
Kevin. Come on, man. The bus
to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.

1049
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:40,623
- I'm not going.
- What?

1050
01:15:40,691 --> 01:15:44,251
Why not?

1051
01:15:44,327 --> 01:15:49,094
Look, things didn't really
turn out how I wanted them to.

1052
01:15:49,165 --> 01:15:51,531
I mean, I don't even
know what I'm doin'.

1053
01:15:51,601 --> 01:15:55,003
I-I'm acting like I've got
everything together tonight.

1054
01:15:55,072 --> 01:15:58,769
I know that Vicky's gonna
ask me if I love her, and...

1055
01:15:58,843 --> 01:16:00,777
I don't know
what I'm gonna say.

1056
01:16:00,845 --> 01:16:02,813
I mean,
I'm on the brink.

1057
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,474
I'm just about to do it.
I should be psyched.

1058
01:16:06,549 --> 01:16:10,646
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe I am just scared.

1059
01:16:10,721 --> 01:16:14,782
Come on, Kev.
Tonight is the night.

1060
01:16:14,859 --> 01:16:17,987
We-We are finally going
to a post-prom party on the lake.

1061
01:16:18,062 --> 01:16:20,393
We have been waiting for this
for four years.

1062
01:16:20,463 --> 01:16:23,557
Why else have we been friends
with Stifler all this time, right?

1063
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:26,935
We were friends
with Stifler?

1064
01:16:27,004 --> 01:16:29,130
Hey, look.

1065
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:33,071
Sherman didn't even
get laid.

1066
01:16:33,143 --> 01:16:35,874
- He didn't?
- No, he pissed himself.

1067
01:16:35,947 --> 01:16:38,107
What?

1068
01:16:39,784 --> 01:16:41,752
We'll tell you
on the bus.

1069
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:44,982
I'm gonna go inside
and grab my bag.

1070
01:16:45,056 --> 01:16:47,580
My date too, perhaps?

1071
01:16:49,259 --> 01:16:51,420
Stifler's mom
got it in the divorce.

1072
01:16:51,494 --> 01:16:53,428
That reminds me
of this one time...

1073
01:16:53,496 --> 01:16:56,431
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

1074
01:16:56,499 --> 01:16:59,161
How come you don't have any stories?
I've got lots of them,

1075
01:16:59,235 --> 01:17:01,430
and you don't have any.

1076
01:17:01,504 --> 01:17:04,702
Oh, I've got stories.
Believe me. They're just, uh...

1077
01:17:04,775 --> 01:17:07,538
They're just a little
more risque than tales of band camp.

1078
01:17:07,611 --> 01:17:12,172
Are they gross or something?
Like guy stuff? Tell me!

1079
01:17:12,248 --> 01:17:14,182
Okay.
You want a story?

1080
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:16,845
Here's a story.
Stifler finds this beer...

1081
01:17:20,024 --> 01:17:24,323
- This is the nicest room in the house.
- Kev, it's perfect.

1082
01:17:35,138 --> 01:17:38,802
You guys are gonna fuck, aren't ya?

1083
01:17:38,876 --> 01:17:41,469
Fuckers!
Fuckers, fuckers!

1084
01:17:41,544 --> 01:17:43,809
Fuckers,
fuckers, fuckers!

1085
01:17:45,215 --> 01:17:47,810
- Out.
- Aw, come on!

1086
01:17:47,885 --> 01:17:50,318
- Get out.
- Aw, man!

1087
01:18:08,371 --> 01:18:10,396
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.

1088
01:18:10,473 --> 01:18:12,806
What's that?

1089
01:18:12,877 --> 01:18:15,174
It's gonna sound
really bad, but, uh,

1090
01:18:15,245 --> 01:18:17,874
I want you to know.

1091
01:18:17,948 --> 01:18:20,644
You see, uh,

1092
01:18:20,718 --> 01:18:24,984
I'm a virgin,
and, uh...

1093
01:18:25,056 --> 01:18:27,718
Well, me, Kevin, Jim
and Finch were...

1094
01:18:27,792 --> 01:18:30,521
We all made this pact...

1095
01:18:30,593 --> 01:18:33,426
that we would
lose our virginity...

1096
01:18:33,496 --> 01:18:35,555
before high school
was over,

1097
01:18:35,633 --> 01:18:38,693
and tonight is supposed
to be the night that we all do it.

1098
01:18:40,704 --> 01:18:42,797
This isn't the best way
to proposition me.

1099
01:18:42,873 --> 01:18:45,671
No, that's...
That's not what I mean.

1100
01:18:45,743 --> 01:18:48,940
W- What I mean is, uh...

1101
01:18:49,013 --> 01:18:51,777
Look, do you know
what made me leave that game?

1102
01:18:51,849 --> 01:18:55,876
See, Coach, he was givin' us
this speech about...

1103
01:18:55,953 --> 01:18:58,649
not slacking off when you see
the opportunity to score...

1104
01:18:58,722 --> 01:19:00,781
This isn't any better,
Chris.

1105
01:19:00,858 --> 01:19:02,951
No, you see...
You see, Heather,

1106
01:19:03,027 --> 01:19:05,460
what I realized is that...

1107
01:19:05,528 --> 01:19:10,431
with you, it's...
not like I'm running towards a goal...

1108
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,834
looking for
the best way to score.

1109
01:19:13,904 --> 01:19:17,395
This may sound
a little corny, but...

1110
01:19:17,474 --> 01:19:19,705
I feel like
I've already won.

1111
01:19:22,245 --> 01:19:26,649
And, uh,
I care about you a lot.

1112
01:19:27,852 --> 01:19:30,149
Oz, I know.

1113
01:19:31,354 --> 01:19:34,688
- You called me Oz.
- Well, yeah.

1114
01:19:34,758 --> 01:19:36,692
It's what your friends
call you.

1115
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,786
I mean, I feel like I'm
one of your friends now.

1116
01:19:39,864 --> 01:19:43,630
And... your girlfriend?

1117
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,334
Are ya lost?

1118
01:20:23,874 --> 01:20:26,741
You're Stifler's mom.
Uh...

1119
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,539
No, no, not lost.
Just, um,

1120
01:20:29,613 --> 01:20:31,546
you know,
taking the tour.

1121
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:38,316
Hey, uh, thank you for letting
us have this wonderful party.

1122
01:20:38,388 --> 01:20:40,823
As if there was
an alternative in the matter.

1123
01:20:45,796 --> 01:20:48,195
So, you enjoying yourself?

1124
01:20:48,264 --> 01:20:51,723
I'm... three sheets
to the wind, ma'am.

1125
01:20:51,802 --> 01:20:54,167
I'm so happy for you.

1126
01:20:54,237 --> 01:20:56,171
But it takes the edge off,
doesn't it?

1127
01:20:58,174 --> 01:21:01,439
- Where's your little date tonight?
- No date. It was...

1128
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:03,912
It was a bathroom incident.

1129
01:21:03,981 --> 01:21:08,576
- Pardon me?
- Never mind.

1130
01:21:12,355 --> 01:21:14,756
You have
anything to drink?

1131
01:21:14,825 --> 01:21:16,759
I believe the kegs
are upstairs.

1132
01:21:18,062 --> 01:21:20,586
That is what
the cretins drink.

1133
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:22,757
I'm talking about
alcohol, liquor.

1134
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,802
- The good stuff.
- All right.

1135
01:21:27,437 --> 01:21:29,371
I got some scotch.

1136
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:34,036
- Single malt?
- Aged <i>18</i> years.

1137
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:36,045
The way I like it.

1138
01:21:39,817 --> 01:21:42,047
Why don't you go
grab a glass from the bar?

1139
01:21:44,454 --> 01:21:47,150
I think I should.

1140
01:21:47,223 --> 01:21:49,157
Allow me.

1141
01:21:50,794 --> 01:21:52,728
You know it's
a bitchin' party.

1142
01:21:52,796 --> 01:21:55,286
The Stif-man
always comes through in the clutch.

1143
01:21:58,769 --> 01:22:02,260
And then he just
puked his brains out.

1144
01:22:02,338 --> 01:22:05,239
- That is a nasty story.
- Yep, I told you.

1145
01:22:05,308 --> 01:22:07,469
Do you want to hear
a nasty story of mine?

1146
01:22:07,543 --> 01:22:09,602
It's sort of sexual.

1147
01:22:11,547 --> 01:22:14,107
Yeah!
Yeah, let's hear it.

1148
01:22:14,183 --> 01:22:18,985
Okay, well, this one time at band camp,
we were playing this game.

1149
01:22:19,056 --> 01:22:22,719
I don't know if you know it,
but it's called "Spin the Bottle."

1150
01:22:22,793 --> 01:22:26,661
And I had to kiss this guy
named Mark Wander on the lips.

1151
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:28,664
And-And he plays
trombone...

1152
01:22:28,732 --> 01:22:31,165
So how do you
want to be?

1153
01:22:31,234 --> 01:22:34,203
Like... how do you
want to do it?

1154
01:22:35,471 --> 01:22:38,133
I don't know.
How do you?

1155
01:22:38,207 --> 01:22:42,975
Like... normal style.
The missionary position.

1156
01:22:44,682 --> 01:22:46,616
Okay.

1157
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:55,017
Kev?

1158
01:22:55,091 --> 01:22:57,389
- Yeah?
- I wanna hear you say it.

1159
01:22:57,460 --> 01:22:59,895
Okay.

1160
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,064
Victoria,

1161
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:07,069
I love you.

1162
01:23:08,839 --> 01:23:11,534
I love you.

1163
01:23:37,801 --> 01:23:40,031
- Oh. My hair.

1164
01:23:47,077 --> 01:23:49,510
You okay?

1165
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:53,515
Yeah. Go slow.

1166
01:24:16,205 --> 01:24:19,140
So the end of the story
is you...

1167
01:24:19,208 --> 01:24:21,301
had to kiss the guy
for 20 seconds.

1168
01:24:21,377 --> 01:24:25,336
Yes! And he was such a dork.
Everyone laughed at me...

1169
01:24:25,415 --> 01:24:29,545
- but I didn't care because it was so funny.
- I get it.

1170
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:33,385
And this one time at band camp,
I stuck a flute in my pussy.

1171
01:24:33,456 --> 01:24:35,583
Hmm.

1172
01:24:35,659 --> 01:24:37,786
Excuse me?

1173
01:24:37,861 --> 01:24:40,590
What? You don't think I know
how to get myself off?

1174
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:44,099
Hell, that's what
half of band camp is... Sex Ed.

1175
01:24:44,167 --> 01:24:47,295
So are we gonna screw soon,
'cause I'm gettin' kinda antsy.

1176
01:24:56,412 --> 01:24:58,608
This'll do. Whoo-hoo!

1177
01:25:00,116 --> 01:25:04,553
Ow!

1178
01:25:04,621 --> 01:25:06,851
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1179
01:25:06,886 --> 01:25:09,082
Now, I have two rubbers.
Wear them both. It'll desensitize you.

1180
01:25:09,125 --> 01:25:11,617
I don't want you coming
so damn early this time.

1181
01:25:13,864 --> 01:25:16,195
What makes you think
that I would come early?

1182
01:25:16,265 --> 01:25:20,326
Come on. I saw you on the 'Net.
Why do you think I accepted this date?

1183
01:25:20,403 --> 01:25:23,133
You're a sure thing.

1184
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:28,042
Yes, I am.

1185
01:25:28,144 --> 01:25:32,809
So I said, "This is very obviously
a Piero della Francesca."

1186
01:25:32,883 --> 01:25:35,681
Hmm.

1187
01:25:40,089 --> 01:25:45,892
So, uh, would you object if I said
that you were quite striking?

1188
01:25:45,963 --> 01:25:50,900
Mr. Finch, are you
trying to seduce me?

1189
01:25:50,968 --> 01:25:53,027
- Yes, ma'am, I am.

1190
01:26:05,448 --> 01:26:09,179
- Mmm, you're dead.

1191
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:50,148
- I had no idea you'd be this good.
- Neither did I.

1192
01:26:50,226 --> 01:26:52,251
Oh, Finchy. Finch.

1193
01:26:52,328 --> 01:26:55,229
- Oh, Stifler's mom, whoa!
- Finchy!

1194
01:27:01,504 --> 01:27:04,530
Okay, let's go.

1195
01:27:04,608 --> 01:27:07,042
What's my name?
Say my name, bitch!

1196
01:27:07,109 --> 01:27:09,270
Michelle, Michelle.

1197
01:27:10,881 --> 01:27:12,815
Oh, God.

1198
01:27:40,509 --> 01:27:42,443
That was
a great night, huh?

1199
01:27:44,881 --> 01:27:46,815
Yeah.

1200
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:51,811
I mean, I just can't believe
we had our senior prom.

1201
01:27:51,888 --> 01:27:55,790
I know.
It went by so fast.

1202
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:58,486
Yeah, it did.

1203
01:27:58,561 --> 01:28:00,495
Kevin?

1204
01:28:05,234 --> 01:28:07,726
Next year with you
going to Ann Arbor...

1205
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:10,932
and me going to Ithaca,

1206
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:14,135
it's not gonna work,
is it?

1207
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:16,235
No.
Don't say that.

1208
01:28:16,312 --> 01:28:18,804
I mean,
we could make it work.

1209
01:28:20,149 --> 01:28:22,778
- It'll be perfect.
- No, Kevin.

1210
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,955
- But...
- See, that's what I've been realizing...

1211
01:28:27,024 --> 01:28:29,788
is that...
nothing's perfect.

1212
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:34,353
And you can't
plan everything.

1213
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:38,196
Well, I guess... you will
be pretty far away.

1214
01:28:39,502 --> 01:28:42,528
And we'll be on our own,
meeting new people.

1215
01:28:46,743 --> 01:28:48,711
Last night, though.

1216
01:28:52,415 --> 01:28:55,407
I wasn't lying.

1217
01:28:56,787 --> 01:28:58,721
I know.

1218
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:17,829
She's gone.
Wha...

1219
01:29:17,908 --> 01:29:19,967
Oh, my God.
She used me.

1220
01:29:20,043 --> 01:29:21,977
I was used.

1221
01:29:23,947 --> 01:29:27,347
I was used.
Cool!

1222
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:31,654
What's this door locked...

1223
01:29:31,722 --> 01:29:33,656
Mom, where's...

1224
01:29:35,157 --> 01:29:39,423
- Mom? Shit-brick?
- Hey, Stifler.

1225
01:29:45,101 --> 01:29:48,537
I just gotta say that women,

1226
01:29:48,605 --> 01:29:51,198
like a fine wine,
only get better with age.

1227
01:29:52,843 --> 01:29:55,937
Of course, I have
no basis for comparison, but, uh,

1228
01:29:56,012 --> 01:29:57,946
it was good.

1229
01:29:58,014 --> 01:30:00,504
So you almost made it,
huh, Oz?

1230
01:30:00,549 --> 01:30:04,714
- I'll just say that we had a great night together.
- Hang in there, buddy.

1231
01:30:04,788 --> 01:30:09,247
- You'll get there.
- You know, guys, I think we're falling in love.

1232
01:30:09,325 --> 01:30:13,159
Wha...
Wow.

1233
01:30:13,229 --> 01:30:15,755
That's great, man.
That's awesome.

1234
01:30:17,033 --> 01:30:19,831
Y- You know what
the coolest thing is, guys?

1235
01:30:19,903 --> 01:30:21,996
This.
You know, right now.

1236
01:30:22,072 --> 01:30:25,803
It's true. I mean, after this,
everything's gonna be different.

1237
01:30:25,876 --> 01:30:29,073
After... getting laid?

1238
01:30:29,145 --> 01:30:32,114
- After high school.
- Here's to the next step.

1239
01:30:32,181 --> 01:30:35,777
- To the next step.
- To the next step. - To the next step.

1240
01:31:26,002 --> 01:31:27,765
- Sweetheart?
