1
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:54,166
Listen to me! Killing a few hostages
is not sufficient!

2
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:56,835
The Americans must be made to suffer.

3
00:00:56,918 --> 00:00:59,254
We must humiliate them.

4
00:00:59,338 --> 00:01:01,965
You do not go far enough,
General Amin.

5
00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:05,802
We must strip their entrails out
and drag them to Damascus,

6
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:09,723
until they include us
in the peace process.

7
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:14,311
Nonsense! This solution
is not bold enough for Libya.

8
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:18,440
I say wipe out Washington
and New York.

9
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:22,235
What? And spoil
three years of good PR?

10
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,530
The Americans believe l'm a nice guy.

11
00:01:25,614 --> 00:01:29,826
In some of their polls, l'm more
popular than their president!

12
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:36,750
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
This is getting us nowhere.

13
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,170
If we do nothing else this week,

14
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:44,091
we must conceive
at least one terrorist act

15
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:47,010
that will show all the world

16
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:50,097
that the United States,
the great Satan,

17
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,350
is but a paper tiger - a weak nation,

18
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:58,230
a weak people,
a people ripe for destruction.

19
00:01:58,313 --> 00:02:01,900
Cowards, no longer willing to fight.

20
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,257
I knew it!

21
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,503
Hey, who are you?

22
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:06,173
I'm Lieutenant Frank Drebin,
Police Squad.

23
00:03:06,256 --> 00:03:09,509
And don't ever
let me catch you guys in America!

24
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:39,623
Watch out!

25
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,789
..98, 99, 100. It's all here.

26
00:05:44,873 --> 00:05:48,084
This completes
our first shipment of heroin.

27
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:50,295
100% pure.

28
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,630
It better be - all 40 kilos.

29
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:56,134
The final shipment
will be delivered in three days.

30
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:59,762
- Then we'll expect payment.
- Don't worry.'

31
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:30,627
Police! Throw down your guns!

32
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:55,234
Kill him.

33
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,787
It's a great day for Americans.
This man alone...

34
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:58,339
There he is!

35
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:01,509
No flowers, thank you.

36
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:05,221
Welcome home, Frank. Good work
in Beirut. We heard about it.

37
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:09,434
Thanks. I want to know one thing -
is it true about Victoria?

38
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:13,146
I'm afraid so.
She ran off with some guy.

39
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,815
They got married last week.

40
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:19,569
Then it's over.
All of this is meaningless.

41
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:22,447
I did it for her. Everything.

42
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,032
And now she's gone.

43
00:08:25,116 --> 00:08:29,287
And you came down here
to get a hot story, didn't you?

44
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,914
Pictures of me
to sell your newspapers.

45
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:35,751
- Frank...
- Sure, you think l'm a big hero.

46
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:40,381
Do any of you understand
how a man can hurt inside?

47
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,592
Frank, they're not here for you.

48
00:08:42,675 --> 00:08:45,178
'Weird Al' Yankovic is on the plane.

49
00:08:50,683 --> 00:08:53,478
What about the wedding?
What was she wearing?

50
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:56,981
Don't torture yourself!
Put her out of your mind.

51
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:00,735
I can't get her out of my mind.
What about the guy?

52
00:09:00,818 --> 00:09:04,071
- Do you know anything about him?
- Not much.

53
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:06,324
Just that he's an Olympic gymnast

54
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:09,076
and it's the best sex she's ever had.

55
00:09:10,286 --> 00:09:14,790
I trusted her and followed my heart.
Foolishly, it seems.

56
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:17,501
I'm just gonna have
to learn to forget.

57
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:22,715
That's why I took my vacation
in Beirut - to find some peace.

58
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,842
It won't be easy.

59
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:28,346
Everywhere I look,
something reminds me of her.

60
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:33,142
Maybe cops and women just don't mix.

61
00:09:33,226 --> 00:09:36,646
What about Nordberg?
I came as soon as I heard.

62
00:09:36,729 --> 00:09:39,106
He's alive, but on life support.

63
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,901
He's got a 50/50 chance of living,

64
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:46,113
though there's only
a 10% chance of that.

65
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:12,181
Mrs Nordberg, I think
we can save your husband's arm.

66
00:10:12,264 --> 00:10:14,308
Where would you like it sent?

67
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:19,522
- Frank! l'm so glad you came!
- Wilma, I came as soon as I heard.

68
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:21,273
Thank you, Frank.

69
00:10:21,357 --> 00:10:24,527
- Where's Nordberg?
- He's right here.

70
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,114
Nordberg, it's Frank, your buddy.

71
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:32,493
I'll get it!

72
00:10:35,997 --> 00:10:39,083
Get the switch
at the back of the bed!

73
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:46,757
Nordberg, it's me, Frank.
Who did this to you?

74
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,843
I...love you.

75
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:54,056
I love you, too, Nordberg.
Who were they?

76
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,810
- Ship... Boat...
- That's right. A boat.

77
00:10:57,893 --> 00:11:01,147
When you're better,
we'll go sailing together,

78
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,024
- just like last year.
- No... Drugs.

79
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:08,529
Nurse, give this man some drugs!
Can't you see he's in pain?

80
00:11:08,612 --> 00:11:11,073
- Give him a shot, quickly!
- No...

81
00:11:11,157 --> 00:11:14,368
Heroin! Heroin, Frank!

82
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:16,746
Nordberg, that's a pretty tall order.

83
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,999
Give me a couple of days
on that one.

84
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:26,589
Oh, my poor Nordberg!
He was such a good man, Frank.

85
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:31,051
He never wanted to hurt anyone.
Who would do such a thing?

86
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:32,803
It's hard to tell.

87
00:11:32,887 --> 00:11:37,933
A gang of thugs, a blackmailer,
an angry husband, a gay lover...

88
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:42,229
Frank, get a hold of yourself!

89
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:47,276
A good cop - needlessly cut down
by some cowardly hoodlums.

90
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:50,863
- No way for a man to die.
- You're right, Ed.

91
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:53,866
A parachute not opening -
that's the way to die,

92
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,410
getting caught in a combine,

93
00:11:56,494 --> 00:11:59,121
having your nuts bit off
by a Laplander.

94
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:01,248
That's the way I want to go.

95
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,878
Frank! This is terrible!

96
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:11,300
Don't worry, Wilma.
Your husband is gonna be all right.

97
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:16,430
Just think positive.
Never let a doubt enter your mind.

98
00:12:16,514 --> 00:12:18,516
He's right, Wilma,

99
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:23,521
but don't wait till the last minute
to fill out those organ donor cards.

100
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:27,316
What l'm trying to say is,
as soon as Nordberg is better,

101
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,568
he's welcome back at Police Squad.

102
00:12:29,652 --> 00:12:34,698
Unless he's a drooling vegetable,
but that's only common sense.

103
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:41,080
Do you know why Nordberg
was at the waterfront?

104
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,875
No...

105
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,170
But I found this at home in a drawer.

106
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:55,803
A photograph!
'I Luv You' out of Caracas.

107
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:58,555
A Panamanian ship.

108
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,851
When he said 'I love you', he was
telling you the name of the ship!

109
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:06,021
I realise that...now.

110
00:13:06,105 --> 00:13:09,900
- We'd better check this out.
- I want every available man on it.

111
00:13:09,984 --> 00:13:12,069
I can't spare anybody.

112
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:16,282
We're in charge of security
for Queen Elizabeth's visit.

113
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:19,034
Wilma, whatever scum did this,

114
00:13:19,118 --> 00:13:23,622
no man will rest until he's behind
bars. Let's grab a bite to eat.

115
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:34,008
Due to the extraordinary efforts
of some of our civic leaders,

116
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:38,887
Queen Elizabeth has included
the city of Los Angeles

117
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:43,142
as one of the cities she'll visit
during her American tour.

118
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,897
Will the city hire
additional security officers?

119
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:54,153
We have placed the Queen's security
in the hands of Police Squad,

120
00:13:54,236 --> 00:13:57,364
a special division
of the Police Department,

121
00:13:57,448 --> 00:14:00,534
represented here
by Lieutenant Frank Drebin.

122
00:14:04,496 --> 00:14:06,540
Thank you, Your Honour.

123
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,418
Louder!

124
00:14:11,503 --> 00:14:14,590
- You can use my radio mic.
- Thank you.

125
00:14:21,263 --> 00:14:25,058
Thank you, Your Honour.
Protecting the Queen's safety

126
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:29,396
is a task that is gladly accepted
by Police Squad.

127
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,567
No matter how silly the idea
of having a queen might be to us,

128
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,655
as Americans we must be gracious
and considerate hosts.

129
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:42,493
Thank you, Lieutenant Drebin.

130
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:48,332
Of course, we all have a stake
in seeing that this portion

131
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:53,045
of the Queen's American tour
is completely protected.

132
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:57,966
And we can take pride
that the Queen...

133
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:06,016
Indeed, it is for all the people,

134
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:11,355
who will be able to share
in these...celebrations...

135
00:15:13,524 --> 00:15:15,817
Especially exciting...

136
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:22,741
will be...the Queen's...
public appearances.

137
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:40,551
We also would like...

138
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:03,865
Ed and I drove to where Nordberg
had been found floating.

139
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:08,996
Without leads, you have to start
somewhere, and that was the harbour.

140
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,374
Please disperse. Please disperse.

141
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:16,795
There's nothing for you to see here.
Keep moving.

142
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,714
Where did they find him?

143
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:20,882
Out there.
Do you wanna take a dinghy?

144
00:16:20,966 --> 00:16:24,177
No, I took care of that
at the press conference.

145
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,556
It doesn't make sense.
Good policeman, bright future...

146
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,975
then something like this happens.

147
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:32,102
He was found by the nightwatchman.

148
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:34,938
I'm gonna talk to the harbour-master.

149
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:37,065
I'll walk around and snoop.

150
00:16:42,654 --> 00:16:46,366
- Yeah?
- Lieutenant Drebin, Police Squad.

151
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,036
I remember you. What do you want?

152
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:52,831
I wanna ask some questions.
Are you familiar with that face?

153
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:56,293
I don't know.
My memory ain't so great.

154
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:59,379
Oh, yeah?
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.

155
00:16:59,463 --> 00:17:01,506
- Still hazy.
- How about this?

156
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,759
I remember. Why do you want to know?

157
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:07,387
- I can't tell you.
- Maybe this'll help.

158
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:11,016
- I don't think I should.
- Still don't think so?

159
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,603
- It's Nordberg, he's a cop.
- No, he was dealin' 'H'.

160
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,438
- What?
- He was dirty!

161
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:19,441
Scum! I ought to
run you in right now!

162
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:23,070
He worked at Ludwig's Shipping.
He tried to push something.

163
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:26,490
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Why should I tell you?

164
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:29,743
- Maybe this'll help.
- I shouldn't tell you.

165
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:32,287
Can you spot me a 20? How about now?

166
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,539
I'm going down to Ludwig's office.

167
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,250
I'll find out
if you're telling the truth.

168
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:43,423
Vincent Ludwig owned one
of the city's largest corporations.

169
00:17:43,507 --> 00:17:46,092
A respected business man
and civic leader,

170
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:49,387
he was to chair the Queen's reception
committee.

171
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:53,725
Now I was about to question him about
drugs and attempted murder.

172
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:02,734
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

173
00:18:02,818 --> 00:18:05,779
Lieutenant Drebin to see you, sir.

174
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:10,283
Show him in.

175
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:17,749
- Lieutenant.
- The feeling is mutual.

176
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,628
Nice to meet you, too. Cuban?

177
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:26,216
No, Dutch-lrish.
My father was from Wales.

178
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:27,843
Sit down.

179
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:31,179
- What a magnificent office.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

180
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:35,809
Most objects I have collected
over a period of many years -

181
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:40,605
my Gainsborough, Ming vases.
Priceless!

182
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:45,652
They are objects which I feel
reflect my personality,

183
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,946
Iike the Japanese fighting fish -

184
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,074
beautiful, graceful, elegant...

185
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,410
yet single-minded of purpose

186
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:57,163
and deadly when it finds
what it wants.

187
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:02,377
This particular one
is valued at over $20,000.

188
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,088
A luxury item, to be certain,

189
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:09,092
but I am a man who appreciates
the finer things in life.

190
00:19:09,175 --> 00:19:13,263
Oh, this...
This is a rare Samurai pen,

191
00:19:13,346 --> 00:19:16,266
a gift from Emperor Hirohito.

192
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:20,395
Unbreakable.
Impervious to everything but water.

193
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:25,358
- Its value is beyond estimation.
- That's fascinating.

194
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:30,405
But l'm sure you didn't pay this
visit for a lecture on fine art.

195
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:33,158
To what do I owe the honour?

196
00:19:33,241 --> 00:19:37,078
I'm investigating the attempted
murder of a dock worker,

197
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:42,500
a man named Nordberg,
a police officer.

198
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:46,421
He is still alive, then?

199
00:19:46,504 --> 00:19:48,882
He was shot six times.

200
00:19:49,132 --> 00:19:52,218
Fortunately, the bullets missed
every vital organ.

201
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:56,014
- The salt water preserved him.
- So they...

202
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:58,600
So they got him
to the hospital in time?

203
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:02,687
He's in the intensive care ward
at Our Lady of the Worthless Miracle.

204
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:06,024
This certainly comes
as a shock to me.

205
00:20:06,107 --> 00:20:11,363
As you know, l'm not the kind of man
who takes such things lightly.

206
00:20:11,446 --> 00:20:15,366
There is no room in my organisation
for criminal activity.

207
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,871
Look out there - a vast
commercial development built by me.

208
00:20:19,954 --> 00:20:24,042
Do you have any idea what was
out there just five years ago?

209
00:20:25,585 --> 00:20:27,587
You bet you do. Orange groves!

210
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,757
Acres of them.
As far as the eye could see.

211
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,720
But now that land will generate
ten times the amount of profit.

212
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:39,724
Are you all right, Lieutenant?

213
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:42,143
Let me get you some Kleenex.

214
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:45,688
Has this officer -

215
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,899
What's his name? Nordberg -

216
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:52,028
been able to tell you anything?

217
00:20:52,112 --> 00:20:56,616
Well, he hasn't been able
to tell us a thing so far,

218
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:59,619
but as soon as
he regains consciousness,

219
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:03,832
we'll see if he
can still play the guitar.

220
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:07,377
- Pardon?
- I've taken up a lot of your time.

221
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,088
I'd like to look
at your employment records

222
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,632
and speak to someone in Personnel.

223
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,300
Of course.

224
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:18,096
- Dominique, send in Miss Spencer.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,892
I am quite busy making arrangements
for the royal visit,

226
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:26,896
but I will have my assistant
provide you with anything you need.

227
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,358
You've been very co-operative.
I'll note that in my report.

228
00:21:30,441 --> 00:21:32,277
My pleasure.

229
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:39,742
Miss Spencer! This is
Lieutenant Drebin from Police Squad.

230
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:43,371
Hello...Mr Drebin.

231
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,623
Hello.

232
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:54,299
Oh!

233
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:13,359
Her hair was the colour
of gold in old paintings.

234
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:17,697
She had a full set of curves

235
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,577
and the kind of legs
you'd like to suck on for a day.

236
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,372
She gave me a look
I could feel in my hip pocket.

237
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:32,295
Yep, this was starting
to get interesting.

238
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:41,512
- Nice beaver.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:45,600
- I just had it stuffed.
- Let me help you with that.

240
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:50,688
This should be
what you're looking for -

241
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:53,524
the shipping and employment records
for Pier 32.

242
00:22:53,608 --> 00:22:56,235
Thank you.

243
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,863
I've heard police work is dangerous.

244
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,282
Yes, that's why I carry a big gun.

245
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:04,202
Couldn't it go off accidentally?

246
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:06,579
I used to have that problem.

247
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:08,706
What did you do about it?

248
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,292
I just think about baseball.

249
00:23:13,086 --> 00:23:16,381
That's a honey of an ankle-bracelet
you have there.

250
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:19,258
Did it slip down there again?

251
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:22,220
Yes, well...
I'll quickly go through these

252
00:23:22,303 --> 00:23:24,347
and get them back to you tomorrow.

253
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,102
Fine, but there's no rush.
I mean, whenever you're through.

254
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:33,356
Thank you. I wish there was
some way I could repay you.

255
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:38,653
How about dinner? I know a place
that serves great Viking food.

256
00:23:38,736 --> 00:23:42,865
It's tempting, but l'm afraid
I must rest this evening,

257
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:44,992
tomorrow being Arbor Day.

258
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:47,954
Of course. Perhaps some other time.

259
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:51,624
- How about a rain check?
- Let's just stick to dinner.

260
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:55,336
Thank you for your help,
Miss Spencer.

261
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:58,714
My pleasure.

262
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,468
- Well?
- Mr Ludwig, you startled me!

263
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:04,428
I'm sorry, my dear.

264
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:07,682
Did you give the lieutenant
what he wanted?

265
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,351
I gave him copies of the files
for Pier 32.

266
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:12,478
Good. That's good.

267
00:24:12,562 --> 00:24:17,567
He is an intriguing fellow,
don't you think?

268
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,654
Well, I don't know.
I've only just met him.

269
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,614
He seems very nice.

270
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:26,909
Jane, I realise
this is an unusual request,

271
00:24:26,993 --> 00:24:30,329
but if there is something illegal
going on in this company,

272
00:24:30,413 --> 00:24:34,208
I need to know about it,
so we can root it out.

273
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:36,377
That's why I want you to...

274
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,715
well, to get to know Drebin
a little better,

275
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:42,842
find out what he knows.

276
00:24:42,925 --> 00:24:45,720
Wouldn't this be best handled
by the police?

277
00:24:45,803 --> 00:24:49,140
We are letting the police handle it,
my dear!

278
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:52,310
But we need to know
the facts quickly

279
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:55,521
before anything
gets into the newspapers.

280
00:24:55,605 --> 00:25:00,067
Don't forget, I have a responsibility
to the stockholders.

281
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:03,696
Well...if you put it that way...

282
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,700
- Yes, l'll do my best.
- That's better.

283
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:13,664
I'm sure you will.

284
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:23,257
It was about 4pm
when I returned to Police Squad.

285
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:27,970
I wanted to see what the lab had
come up with on Nordberg's jacket,

286
00:25:28,054 --> 00:25:30,514
the one they'd found on the docks.

287
00:25:30,598 --> 00:25:34,310
You can tell a lot from fibre
samples if they aren't too wet.

288
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,979
I was hoping we wouldn't
come up dry.

289
00:25:37,063 --> 00:25:38,689
Hey, look out!

290
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,693
Police! Halt!

291
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:54,497
Anybody catch the licence plate?

292
00:25:54,914 --> 00:25:58,000
Anybody get a look at the driver?

293
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,715
Take the names of everybody here
for questioning.

294
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,594
I've got to get...inside.

295
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:18,729
Hi, Ed, Ted. You got
those fibre samples yet?

296
00:26:18,813 --> 00:26:20,898
- We got some action here.
- What?

297
00:26:20,981 --> 00:26:23,442
We're testing our anti-graffiti wall.

298
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:25,403
We've got customers.

299
00:26:25,486 --> 00:26:29,198
It reacts when
the spray hits the sensors.

300
00:26:32,451 --> 00:26:34,703
You've done it again - mazel tov!

301
00:26:34,787 --> 00:26:37,581
Good work.
What will you think of next?

302
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:39,708
Now that you mention it,

303
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:42,670
here's something
we developed only yesterday.

304
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:45,589
To the casual observer -
an ordinary shoe.

305
00:26:45,673 --> 00:26:49,593
But in actuality...
it makes a handy weapon.

306
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:52,930
And everything a cop would need.

307
00:26:53,013 --> 00:26:55,099
We call it the Swiss Army Shoe.

308
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:59,770
- Great. And the fibre samples?
- Just one more thing.

309
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:02,148
See these cufflinks l'm wearing?

310
00:27:02,231 --> 00:27:06,902
They're not just cufflinks. Each one
fires a single pin-sized dart,

311
00:27:06,986 --> 00:27:10,072
that knocks out your victim
for a few minutes.

312
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:12,408
Let me demonstrate on Ed.

313
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:17,079
Ted! Why?

314
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:22,084
Don't worry.
He'll be up and around in no time.

315
00:27:22,168 --> 00:27:26,297
- Why don't you take a pair?
- Actually, I could use another pair.

316
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,257
I think you'll like them.

317
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,093
- Want this, chief?
- Thank you, Al.

318
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:34,263
There's something
on the side of your mouth, Al.

319
00:27:34,346 --> 00:27:36,891
No, no. The other side.

320
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:41,687
As you requested, we took some
fibre samples from Nordberg's jacket.

321
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,190
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

322
00:27:44,273 --> 00:27:47,776
- What do you mean?
- Take a look for yourself.

323
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:54,283
- I can't see anything.
- Use your open eye, Frank.

324
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:57,036
Yeah, I can see it now.

325
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,706
At first, it appears
to be the normal cotton fibres.

326
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:03,500
But we discovered
a fine white powder.

327
00:28:05,002 --> 00:28:07,338
Pure heroin.

328
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:10,507
How well do you know Nordberg?

329
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:14,178
We were partners for nine years
and he's my best friend.

330
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:17,681
We can't allow personal feelings
to get in the way.

331
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:22,519
- Are you saying that Nordberg...?
- The Queen arrives in two days.

332
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:25,147
If the press should pick this up,

333
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,317
it could be embarrassing
for the police and the city.

334
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,655
I'm sorry, Frank. I'm giving you
24 hours to clear Nordberg.

335
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:45,209
- Mr Ludwig?
- Yes?

336
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:49,922
- A Mr Pahpshmir is here.
- Show him in.

337
00:28:57,137 --> 00:29:00,224
Is there something wrong, Mr Ludwig?

338
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,059
No, it's nothing.

339
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:06,397
- Then may we get down to business?
- Certainly. Have a seat.

340
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,608
I can carry out your request.

341
00:29:09,692 --> 00:29:13,946
- My price is $20 million.
- Your price is not a problem.

342
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:19,368
But there is concern
on the part of those I represent,

343
00:29:19,451 --> 00:29:25,249
that you would be able to...
complete so difficult a task.

344
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:27,710
Tell me, Mr Pahpshmir,

345
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:33,382
in all the world,
who is the most effective assassin?

346
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:38,971
I would think anyone who manages to
conceal his identity as an assassin.

347
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:44,017
Yes, but there is
even a more ideal assassin.

348
00:29:46,103 --> 00:29:50,357
One who doesn't know
he is an assassin.

349
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:53,110
- Care for some tea?
- Yes, please.

350
00:29:53,193 --> 00:29:56,321
Dominique, service for two, please.

351
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,586
I must kill Pahpshmir.

352
00:30:18,594 --> 00:30:22,347
- Cream and sugar, sir?
- Mr Pahpshmir?

353
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:28,228
Cream only, please.

354
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,109
- There's a gun on the floor, sir!
- Just leave it. It's all right.

355
00:30:34,193 --> 00:30:37,446
- The tea, please.
- Of course, sir.

356
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:43,952
Mr Pahpshmir, have you ever seen
sensory-induced hypnosis?

357
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:46,079
I think I just have.

358
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:48,916
How will she get near the target?

359
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:52,961
Oh, I doubt whether it will be her.

360
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:56,757
Good secretaries
are so hard to find these days.

361
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,468
And it seems to me...

362
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:04,097
anyone...can be an assassin.

363
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:12,230
I had 24 hours to find
something to clear my friend's name.

364
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:15,275
I returned to the hospital
with Ludwig's records

365
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:17,861
to try to jog Nordberg's memory.

366
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:21,657
Doctor, I have the chart,
if you're ready to go over it.

367
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:24,868
I'll be with you
when l've finished with Mr Nordberg.

368
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:27,037
Yes, Doctor.

369
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,253
You'll be out of here
in a couple of...

370
00:31:41,301 --> 00:31:45,097
- I'd like to see Officer Nordberg.
- Sign in, please.

371
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,517
Wait a minute!
Where's the police guard?

372
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,562
- Drebin called and sent him home.
- Drebin?

373
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:58,276
I must kill Nordberg.
I must kill Nordberg.

374
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,613
Drebin, Police Squad!
Let go of that pillow!

375
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,937
Medical emergency!

376
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,114
Drebin, Police Squad.
Follow that black car!

377
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:48,118
The car! Follow that car!

378
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,830
Stephanie, check your mirror. Signal.

379
00:32:51,913 --> 00:32:54,374
Now pull into traffic.

380
00:32:57,544 --> 00:32:59,713
Try and ease off on the brake.

381
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:06,011
- Give it a little gas.
- I know a short cut. Turn left here!

382
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:11,725
- There he is!
- Easy!

383
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:28,575
Turn right! Follow him!

384
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:32,579
It's OK.
Normally, you would not be going 65

385
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,749
down the wrong way
of a one-way street.

386
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,711
Apply the brakes.

387
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,505
Now put it in reverse.

388
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,432
- You dumb broad!
- Stephanie...

389
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:54,726
Gently extend your arm.

390
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:59,898
Extend your middle finger.

391
00:34:02,651 --> 00:34:05,737
- Very good. Well done.
- There he is!

392
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,281
Go for it, Stephanie!

393
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:55,370
Excuse me. Excuse me.

394
00:34:55,453 --> 00:34:58,915
All right, move on!
Nothing to see here!

395
00:34:58,999 --> 00:35:01,459
Please disperse!

396
00:35:01,543 --> 00:35:04,087
Nothing to see here. Please!

397
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:11,011
The attempt on Nordberg's
life left me shaken and disturbed.

398
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,972
The questions kept coming up
again and again,

399
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:16,141
Iike bubbles in a case of soda.

400
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:19,561
Who was this character
in the hospital?

401
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:23,481
Why was he trying to kill
Nordberg...and for whom?

402
00:35:23,565 --> 00:35:27,485
Did Ludwig lie to me?
I didn't have any proof,

403
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:30,155
but somehow,
I didn't entirely trust him.

404
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:34,033
Why was the 'I Luv You'
not listed in Ludwig's records?

405
00:35:34,117 --> 00:35:36,870
If it was, did he know about it?

406
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:39,205
If he didn't, who did?

407
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:41,499
And where the hell was l?

408
00:35:44,461 --> 00:35:47,088
It was almost midnight
when I got home.

409
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:49,924
I just wanted
to slip under my blankets,

410
00:35:50,008 --> 00:35:53,428
but my night was
just about to begin.

411
00:36:32,217 --> 00:36:34,677
You're late.

412
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:38,515
That depends on what l'm late for.

413
00:36:38,598 --> 00:36:41,684
You said we should
have dinner some time.

414
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:44,646
Tonight became 'some time'.

415
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,274
I'm boiling a roast.

416
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:53,029
How hot and wet do you like it?

417
00:36:53,112 --> 00:36:58,368
Very hot and awfully wet.

418
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:02,205
You seem to know your way
around a kitchen.

419
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:05,750
I'm just as handy
in other rooms of the house.

420
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,169
That shirt looks familiar.

421
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:12,507
It's yours. I didn't want
to get stained or wrinkled.

422
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,593
At least...not yet.

423
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:22,892
Do you mind if I slip
into something more comfortable?

424
00:37:29,232 --> 00:37:31,734
There. That's better.

425
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:36,948
I hope you've brought your appetite.

426
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:38,908
I've brought everything.

427
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:41,619
Well, then, dig in.

428
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:50,962
Interesting. Almost as interesting
as the photographs I saw today.

429
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:53,423
I was young. I needed the work.

430
00:37:53,506 --> 00:37:56,634
No, they were taken
at Ludwig's docks.

431
00:37:56,718 --> 00:38:00,972
A ship came in, a Panamanian ship.
It wasn't on Ludwig's records.

432
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:03,349
Probably an oversight.

433
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:06,769
How is your...meat?

434
00:38:09,814 --> 00:38:11,899
You be the judge of that.

435
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,988
Mmm...

436
00:38:19,782 --> 00:38:22,243
I've got nine more.

437
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:29,834
- Have you seen that ship?
- I don't know.

438
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:33,755
It doesn't look like ours,
but we deal with so many ships.

439
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:36,758
Has Officer Nordberg
told you anything?

440
00:38:36,841 --> 00:38:40,887
No, there's been another attempt
on his life. He's in a coma.

441
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:45,266
That's terrible!
This world is such a violent place.

442
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:48,060
If it wasn't, l'd be out of a job,

443
00:38:48,144 --> 00:38:52,857
but l'd give it up tomorrow
to live in a world without crime.

444
00:38:54,066 --> 00:38:56,110
That's beautiful.

445
00:38:59,322 --> 00:39:02,158
This is all happening too fast.

446
00:39:04,911 --> 00:39:08,581
- I've been hurt before.
- I'm sorry.

447
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,127
I'd known her for years.

448
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:16,589
We used to go to
all the police functions together.

449
00:39:16,672 --> 00:39:19,884
How I loved her,
but she had her music.

450
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:22,762
I think she had her music.

451
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:26,641
She'd hang out with the
Chicago Male Chorus and Symphony.

452
00:39:26,724 --> 00:39:30,770
I don't recall her playing
an instrument or being able to sing.

453
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:33,815
Yet she was on the road
300 days of the year.

454
00:39:33,898 --> 00:39:38,986
I bought her a harp for Christmas.
She asked me what it was.

455
00:39:41,405 --> 00:39:43,866
It's the same old story.
Boy finds girl.

456
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,619
Boy loses girl. Girl finds boy.

457
00:39:46,702 --> 00:39:49,789
Boy forgets girl. Boy remembers girl.

458
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:52,124
Girl dies in a blimp accident

459
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:55,086
over the Orange Bowl
on New Year's Day.

460
00:39:55,169 --> 00:39:58,256
- Goodyear?
- No, the worst.

461
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:00,091
Poor dear!

462
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:06,889
Now, now. I don't want to upset you.

463
00:40:06,973 --> 00:40:09,976
Frank, it's not that.

464
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:12,478
Why did you have to be so wonderful?

465
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:18,818
- There's something I must tell you.
- No! No need to tell me anything.

466
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:21,821
What's in the past
doesn't matter anyway.

467
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:23,322
Maybe...

468
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:28,369
Maybe we're just two lonely souls
who have found each other.

469
00:40:32,248 --> 00:40:34,667
Funny-face!

470
00:40:52,435 --> 00:40:56,105
I want you to know...
I practise safe sex.

471
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:57,940
So do l.

472
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:36,330
I had a wonderful day, Frank. I can't
believe we just met yesterday.

473
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:40,292
You really mean that?
You're not just saying it,

474
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:42,837
because we exchanged bodily fluids?

475
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,298
No, I really mean it.
You're very special.

476
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:50,719
- Can I interest you in a nightcap?
- No, thanks, I don't wear them.

477
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:53,138
Actually, l'm on stake-out tonight.

478
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:57,142
I'll be thinking about you.
I'll call you tomorrow.

479
00:42:58,394 --> 00:42:59,937
OK.

480
00:43:06,443 --> 00:43:08,487
Good night!

481
00:43:18,831 --> 00:43:21,917
The answer's up there
in Ludwig's office.

482
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:24,962
Call it what you will -
a hunch, women's intuition.

483
00:43:25,045 --> 00:43:27,256
Ludwig knows more than he's saying.

484
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:31,343
A hunch won't stand up in court.
Where are your hard facts?

485
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:35,306
He's the only one except us
who knew Nordberg was still alive.

486
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:39,852
Next thing we know,
some thug tries to knock him off.

487
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:44,898
Maybe. But breaking into Ludwig's
office is taking a big chance.

488
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:48,444
I know. You take a chance
getting up in the morning,

489
00:43:48,527 --> 00:43:51,655
crossing the street
or sticking your face in a fan.

490
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:53,782
There he is!

491
00:43:57,536 --> 00:44:00,748
Just trust me on this, Ed.
I know l'm right.

492
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:02,791
OK, but be careful.

493
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:05,961
Get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

494
00:44:57,679 --> 00:44:59,723
Bingo!

495
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:49,481
'20,000,000 deposited,
Omani Bank, Zurich,

496
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:51,775
'upon proof of Queen's death.'

497
00:48:14,209 --> 00:48:16,461
Destroying property, arson...

498
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:19,673
sexual assault
with a concrete dildo?!

499
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:22,592
What the hell were you doing there?

500
00:48:22,676 --> 00:48:24,761
I'm sorry about that, Your Honour,

501
00:48:24,845 --> 00:48:29,099
but we believe Ludwig is involved
in a plot to assassinate the Queen.

502
00:48:29,182 --> 00:48:32,978
That's ridiculous!
Where is this 'evidence'?

503
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:37,023
Well...it...burned in the f-fire.

504
00:48:37,107 --> 00:48:38,775
Gentlemen,

505
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:43,238
Vincent Ludwig is one of the most
respected members of this community.

506
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:48,076
If we're very nice to him,
he will agree not to press charges.

507
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,829
- Your Honour!
- Did I make myself clear?

508
00:48:50,912 --> 00:48:53,540
Yes, Your Honour. Good day.

509
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:57,878
Drebin!

510
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:04,259
I don't want any more trouble like
you had last year. That's my policy.

511
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:09,598
When I see five weirdos dressed
in togas stabbing a guy in a park,

512
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:12,767
I shoot the bastards.
That's my policy.

513
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:19,691
That was a Shakespeare in the Park
production of 'Julius Caesar'!

514
00:49:19,774 --> 00:49:24,446
- You killed five actors! Good ones.
- Your Honour...

515
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:28,867
Your presence at the Queen's
reception tonight is not necessary.

516
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,911
Is that understood?

517
00:49:30,994 --> 00:49:34,080
We understand, Your Honour.
Thank you.

518
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,689
The plane has taxied to a stop.

519
00:49:59,773 --> 00:50:02,776
Any minute now
we expect the doors to open

520
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:05,445
and we'll get a glimpse
of the Queen,

521
00:50:05,528 --> 00:50:09,574
as she begins her first visit
to Los Angeles in five years.

522
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:13,203
It's a balmy, beautiful evening too.

523
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:16,706
She's going from here
to a formal reception...

524
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:25,173
- Jane!
- Frank!

525
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,387
I'm just making some dinner.
Are you hungry?

526
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:32,514
Maybe just a bite.

527
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:35,683
Ludwig wanted me to ask you
to meet him tonight.

528
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:40,355
There is something you should know.
I was in his place last night.

529
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:45,276
How nice! Did he show you his
Ming vases and rare oil paintings?

530
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,697
Jane, I think that he's involved
in a number of criminal activities.

531
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:51,825
Frank, stop it!

532
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:55,245
Vincent Ludwig is a well-respected,
generous, kind man.

533
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:58,581
- You don't know him like I do.
- How's that?

534
00:50:58,665 --> 00:51:04,129
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm sorry. I'm worried about you.

535
00:51:04,212 --> 00:51:08,341
I don't trust him and I don't want
you mixed up in anything dangerous.

536
00:51:08,425 --> 00:51:11,678
Are Woo back in business?
They closed down three years ago.

537
00:51:11,761 --> 00:51:16,808
Gee, has it been that long? I don't
feel like Chinese tonight anyway.

538
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:23,231
It's sweet of you to be concerned,
but you're wrong about Vincent.

539
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:27,110
He's such a gentleman.
He's so generous.

540
00:51:27,193 --> 00:51:29,237
He just wants to talk with you

541
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,574
to clear up any doubts
you might have.

542
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:34,742
- When?
- Tonight.

543
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:37,704
Meet him at the 7th Street
stockyards.

544
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:40,665
All right,
but promise you'll be careful.

545
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:44,377
Of course I will,
funny-face, for you.

546
00:51:45,628 --> 00:51:48,423
I've got to go. See you tomorrow.

547
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:52,343
Are you sure you won't have
something to eat?

548
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:19,746
Ludwig?

549
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:22,916
- Drebin?
- Yeah, l'm Drebin.

550
00:52:22,999 --> 00:52:26,753
I have a message for you
from Vincent Ludwig.

551
00:52:29,672 --> 00:52:31,716
I'm sorry, I can't hear you!

552
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:34,802
Don't fire the gun
while you're talking.

553
00:52:57,325 --> 00:53:02,163
All right, put your gun down
and your hands up!

554
00:53:35,863 --> 00:53:38,616
Matthews, stake out that end,

555
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:42,787
and card-check for
anyone suspicious looking.

556
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,956
Frank, what are you doing here?

557
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,835
I've been trading shots
with one of Ludwig's goons.

558
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:52,630
They're planning
to do her tonight, here.

559
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:57,677
- We better be on the lookout.
- Excuse me, ma'am, security.

560
00:53:59,512 --> 00:54:04,225
- What's the meaning of this?
- Relax! Nothing will happen.

561
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:07,395
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah? What about this?

562
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:11,816
You think we were born yesterday?
You didn't do anything, huh?

563
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:13,484
I got rights!

564
00:54:13,568 --> 00:54:16,821
Ed, he's got a picture of your wife!

565
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:18,948
Ethel!

566
00:54:20,533 --> 00:54:23,202
All right,
anyone else here seeing his wife?

567
00:54:23,286 --> 00:54:26,664
That's all right, Frank.
Let's get in the hall.

568
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,510
Are you enjoying yourself, my dear?

569
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:44,223
I'm so excited to be here.
I appreciate your inviting me.

570
00:54:44,307 --> 00:54:48,144
Pleasure's all mine.
Perhaps afterwards we can...

571
00:54:50,354 --> 00:54:52,190
- Drebin!
- Frank!

572
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:55,401
You're both right.
Surprised to see me, Mr Ludwig?

573
00:54:55,484 --> 00:54:58,404
This is not the time
or place to talk.

574
00:54:58,487 --> 00:55:01,073
It's way past the time we talked.

575
00:55:01,157 --> 00:55:03,618
The gloves are off,
l'm playing hardball.

576
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:07,997
It's fourth and fifteen, and
you're looking at a full court press.

577
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,043
Mr Drebin!
lf you have evidence, then use it.

578
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:16,088
If not, I am warning you -
get off my back!

579
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:18,216
Or it will cost you dearly.

580
00:55:20,968 --> 00:55:25,181
- Frank, what's wrong?
- A lot of things, sweetie-pie.

581
00:55:25,264 --> 00:55:28,976
A meeting that turned into
a peek-a-boo session with bullets,

582
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,313
set up by someone
who's been playing me like a violin.

583
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:35,191
Funny-face,
what are you talking about?

584
00:55:35,274 --> 00:55:39,320
My stockyard meeting, butter-wings.
Don't you remember setting that up?

585
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:42,573
Mr Ludwig said you'd called it off!
Believe me!

586
00:55:42,657 --> 00:55:44,992
Thumb me another one, shuckie-lumps!

587
00:55:45,076 --> 00:55:47,828
Frank, it's the truth!

588
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:51,874
Cops and women don't mix.
Like eating a spoonful of Drano.

589
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:55,795
It'll clean you out,
but it'll leave you hollow inside.

590
00:55:55,878 --> 00:55:57,922
Too bad, sugar-puff.

591
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,093
We could have been something.

592
00:56:02,176 --> 00:56:04,845
I only did what I was told to do!

593
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:07,264
- Like make love to me?
- Frank!

594
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:11,185
That makes things easier, Princess.

595
00:56:11,268 --> 00:56:14,605
To think I trusted you!
I made a big mistake.

596
00:56:14,689 --> 00:56:18,275
- You can take this back.
- Whose is that?

597
00:56:20,361 --> 00:56:24,573
Doesn't matter.
Take care of yourself, baby.

598
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:27,868
By the way...

599
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,912
I faked every orgasm.

600
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:32,915
Funny-face!

601
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:36,252
And to commemorate our friendship,

602
00:56:36,335 --> 00:56:40,881
the city of Los Angeles is proud
to present to the Royal Family

603
00:56:40,965 --> 00:56:47,096
this Revolutionary War musket,
donated by Mr Vincent Ludwig.

604
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,642
Ladies and gentlemen,
Her Royal Highness,

605
00:56:51,726 --> 00:56:54,562
Queen Elizabeth ll!

606
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,477
It's disgusting the way they splash
this stuff all over the newspapers!

607
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,188
What is journalism coming to?

608
00:57:37,271 --> 00:57:40,900
You're laying on top of the Queen
with her legs wrapped around you

609
00:57:40,983 --> 00:57:42,568
and they call that news!

610
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:46,197
They can't kick you off the Force,
it's not fair.

611
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,158
I know. Life isn't always fair.

612
00:57:49,241 --> 00:57:54,663
Just think, the next time I shoot
someone, I could be arrested.

613
00:57:54,747 --> 00:57:56,874
Hey, look at that!

614
00:57:56,957 --> 00:58:02,087
The missing evidence in the Kilner
case! My God, he WAS innocent!

615
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:05,466
He went to the chair
two years ago, Frank.

616
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:08,928
Well...what's the use?

617
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:12,097
What good are these damn awards
and citations?

618
00:58:12,181 --> 00:58:13,807
Frank...

619
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:16,435
Frank, that's not your desk!

620
00:58:16,518 --> 00:58:19,855
Frank! l've been
looking all over for you!

621
00:58:19,939 --> 00:58:23,025
Running another errand
for your boyfriend?

622
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:26,695
I tried to call last night.
I went by your place. Where were you?

623
00:58:26,779 --> 00:58:29,198
I was out walking. All night.

624
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:32,284
Listen to me!
I have important information.

625
00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:36,121
There was never anything
between Vincent and me.

626
00:58:36,205 --> 00:58:39,583
- He likes East German men.
- What about you?

627
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,835
I like cops.

628
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:45,798
- All right! Yeah!
- Settle down. Take it easy.

629
00:58:46,924 --> 00:58:49,843
- What've you got?
- I overheard Ludwig.

630
00:58:49,927 --> 00:58:55,057
You were right. He is planning to
have someone assassinate the Queen!

631
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,518
- Where?
- At the baseball game.

632
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:01,021
The Queen will be there
as Ludwig's guest.

633
00:59:01,105 --> 00:59:05,234
Is Ludwig going to shoot her
in front of 60,000 fans?

634
00:59:05,317 --> 00:59:08,112
No, a player,
during the 7th inning stretch.

635
00:59:08,195 --> 00:59:11,031
- It starts in 20 minutes.
- I'll go.

636
00:59:11,115 --> 00:59:14,118
- I'll go with you.
- Stay with Ludwig

637
00:59:14,201 --> 00:59:17,454
- to allay suspicion.
- OK, let's go!

638
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:19,331
Wait! Wait!

639
00:59:19,415 --> 00:59:23,502
I've gotten you into enough trouble
already. I'll go alone.

640
00:59:23,585 --> 00:59:28,507
No! This'll get you back on
the Force. We're right behind you.

641
00:59:31,343 --> 00:59:35,597
Frank? I wanted you to know now,

642
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:39,977
I've loved you since the first day
I met you, and l'll never stop.

643
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,104
I'm a very lucky woman.

644
00:59:42,688 --> 00:59:44,106
So am l.

645
00:59:52,448 --> 00:59:56,952
Good afternoon.
We're coming live from the Big A,

646
00:59:57,035 --> 01:00:00,205
where the California Angels
meet the Seattle Mariners

647
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:04,626
in their showdown
for the Division League.

648
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:08,464
Hello! l'm Curt Gowdy,
along with Jim Palmer,

649
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:11,633
Tim McCarver, Dick Vitale, Mel Allen,

650
01:00:11,717 --> 01:00:14,928
Dick Enberg and Dr Joyce Brothers.

651
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:17,765
Join us for this
all-important ball game.

652
01:00:17,848 --> 01:00:19,600
And a special game it is.

653
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:23,520
As we know, it is being attended
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

654
01:00:23,604 --> 01:00:26,273
I'm sure she'll enjoy this game, Jim.

655
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,443
We've got all the exits covered.

656
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:31,612
I ought to arrest Ludwig right now.

657
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:35,574
No, we've got to let him
make the first move.

658
01:00:35,657 --> 01:00:39,369
The Mayor would have you arrested.
You've got to stay out of sight.

659
01:00:39,453 --> 01:00:42,122
I've got to get that assassin.

660
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:44,374
It could be any of those players.

661
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:48,003
I've got to get down on that field
and search those players.

662
01:00:48,086 --> 01:00:51,632
Ladies and gentlemen,
please rise and welcome

663
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,301
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth ll!

664
01:01:03,018 --> 01:01:05,062
One moment.

665
01:01:07,105 --> 01:01:10,067
Over there - these seats are taken.

666
01:01:25,624 --> 01:01:29,169
My dear, is something bothering you?

667
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:30,963
No, why do you ask?

668
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:35,259
You haven't said a word.
You seem...nervous.

669
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:40,013
Well, you know how important
this game is for the Angels.

670
01:01:40,097 --> 01:01:43,684
Why he not here now?
I do not like to wait for him.

671
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:49,564
Mr Pallazzo, our head usher will
be here in two minutes. Please wait.

672
01:01:49,648 --> 01:01:54,027
- He should be here now!
- I'll send him right over.

673
01:01:54,111 --> 01:01:57,197
I do not wait for him!
He waits for me!

674
01:02:01,868 --> 01:02:04,329
- Yes?
- Mr Pallazzo?

675
01:02:04,413 --> 01:02:08,125
I am the head usher.
I am here to... Excuse me.

676
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:17,259
- Mr Pallazzo?
- Yes?

677
01:02:17,342 --> 01:02:21,346
- I am the head usher.
- One second.

678
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,931
Ladies and gentlemen,

679
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:27,352
on behalf of the California Angels
and the City of Los Angeles,

680
01:02:27,436 --> 01:02:29,855
on the occasion of the royal visit,

681
01:02:29,938 --> 01:02:33,442
please welcome
internationally-renowned opera star,

682
01:02:33,525 --> 01:02:35,944
Enrico Pallazzo!

683
01:02:38,864 --> 01:02:42,367
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us honour America,

684
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:48,415
as Mr Pallazzo will now sing
our national anthem.

685
01:04:10,038 --> 01:04:14,125
And now we'll wait
for the exchange of line-ups

686
01:04:14,209 --> 01:04:16,503
and the start of today's ball game.

687
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:29,724
Excuse me, could you tell me,
is this an official bat?

688
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:36,606
The Queen's visit
has brought a sell-out crowd!

689
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:40,986
And the fans are being entertained
by the stadium's Angel Vision,

690
01:04:41,069 --> 01:04:44,948
showing some unusual moments
in baseball over the years!

691
01:05:05,218 --> 01:05:07,262
Sorry, fellas!

692
01:05:35,123 --> 01:05:37,417
How about that?

693
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:40,962
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
01:05:41,046 --> 01:05:45,592
now taking the field -
your California Angels!

695
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:55,518
For everybody's safety,

696
01:05:55,602 --> 01:05:59,856
we ask that you do not throw
any objects on the field.

697
01:05:59,939 --> 01:06:02,442
We thank you for your co-operation.

698
01:06:05,111 --> 01:06:09,657
As the Angels take the field, we're
ready for the first pitch ceremony

699
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:13,745
with the Queen of England
ready to toss out the first ball.

700
01:06:17,165 --> 01:06:21,252
How about that?
Let's have a round of applause!

701
01:06:21,336 --> 01:06:23,755
We're ready for the start,

702
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:26,800
as these lovely ladies would agree.

703
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:30,428
Those are the players' wives,
here to enjoy the game.

704
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,564
What d'you say, Cummings?
Are we gonna do this today?

705
01:06:41,648 --> 01:06:43,274
Do what?

706
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:45,151
Play ball!

707
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:51,241
Frank! Al, it's Frank!

708
01:06:56,204 --> 01:07:00,667
The game's under way. Dave Spiwack
ready to face Jay Johnstone!

709
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:23,231
- Nothing to report.
- Don't worry, Al.

710
01:07:23,314 --> 01:07:26,776
If one of the players is the killer,
Frank'll find him,

711
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:30,113
even if he has to search
every one of them.

712
01:07:30,196 --> 01:07:33,575
..lead-off hitter Jay Johnstone.

713
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:37,662
Hello, pal. Let's see
if that uniform's on straight.

714
01:07:37,745 --> 01:07:42,625
Good here. Now let's see the shirt.
You should take a large.

715
01:07:42,709 --> 01:07:45,837
It's a little tight in the crotch.

716
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:48,339
All right? All set?

717
01:07:50,592 --> 01:07:53,177
OK, play ball!

718
01:08:21,706 --> 01:08:23,666
Strike?

719
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:29,297
Yeah, strike!

720
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:46,397
Stee-rike two!

721
01:09:01,496 --> 01:09:06,834
Stee-rike three!

722
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,427
You're clean!

723
01:11:49,163 --> 01:11:50,748
Have you found him yet?

724
01:11:50,831 --> 01:11:53,417
No, and l've searched
almost everybody.

725
01:11:53,501 --> 01:11:57,671
Yeah. There's only one more out
before the seventh inning stretch.

726
01:11:57,755 --> 01:12:02,259
You're going to have to stall them.
Don't let 'em get that third out.

727
01:12:02,343 --> 01:12:04,011
Right.

728
01:12:05,596 --> 01:12:11,519
The Mariners' number four -
Armando Criscione! Criscione!

729
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:21,695
- Ball!
- Ball?

730
01:12:32,123 --> 01:12:33,749
Ball!

731
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:47,680
Get...get...what the...? Get off!

732
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,808
Catch it! Catch it!

733
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:57,356
- Get 'em off!
- Go, go, go!

734
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,238
- Safe!
- What do you mean, safe?

735
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:06,448
I don't believe it!

736
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:10,369
Second base! On two!

737
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:13,622
There's a throw by the catcher

738
01:13:13,706 --> 01:13:17,126
and now they've got Criscione
hung up between 1st and 2nd!

739
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:19,336
What the hell are you doing?

740
01:13:19,420 --> 01:13:20,588
What?

741
01:13:20,671 --> 01:13:25,467
- You're not supposed to do that!
- Wait a minute! Stop that!

742
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:28,262
Put that back down! Give me the ball!

743
01:13:30,890 --> 01:13:32,516
I'll get you!

744
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:34,894
It's hard to believe,

745
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:38,689
but apparently the umpires
have got Criscione in a run-down!

746
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,152
- Safe!
- Safe?

747
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:44,653
How about that?

748
01:13:44,737 --> 01:13:46,572
- Out!
- Safe!

749
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,657
- Out!
- He was safe!

750
01:13:48,741 --> 01:13:49,950
- Out!
- Safe!

751
01:13:50,034 --> 01:13:52,536
There's a sight l've never seen!

752
01:13:54,288 --> 01:13:56,248
- Safe!
- What are you doing?

753
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:57,875
Safe! Safe! Safe!

754
01:13:57,958 --> 01:14:00,753
- He was out!
- He was safe!

755
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,631
You idiot! He was out!

756
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:06,091
All right, you're out of here!

757
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,261
- What?
- You can't throw an umpire out!

758
01:14:09,345 --> 01:14:11,889
All right, YOU'RE out!

759
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:17,144
Hold on! Even the guy running
the scoreboard says he was out!

760
01:14:17,227 --> 01:14:20,564
And he's up in the mezzanine!

761
01:14:20,648 --> 01:14:22,066
It's the third out!

762
01:14:39,416 --> 01:14:42,544
I must kill...the Queen.

763
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:49,802
I must kill...the Queen.

764
01:14:52,513 --> 01:14:54,556
Frank, it's the right-fielder!

765
01:15:00,854 --> 01:15:04,608
- You're the boss!
- It was safe.

766
01:15:04,691 --> 01:15:07,277
Now, we're going to take a walk.

767
01:15:07,653 --> 01:15:10,531
How could you
do something so vicious?

768
01:15:10,614 --> 01:15:15,494
It was easy. Don't forget I spent
two years as a building contractor.

769
01:15:15,577 --> 01:15:17,830
Now, let's go quietly.

770
01:15:22,334 --> 01:15:24,420
Hey, look at that! Let's get him!

771
01:15:35,681 --> 01:15:37,891
Kick him in the balls!

772
01:16:10,883 --> 01:16:13,886
I must kill...the Queen.

773
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,815
Look out!

774
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:36,158
The umpire...
He saved the Queen's life!

775
01:16:36,241 --> 01:16:38,285
That's not the umpire, Your Honour.

776
01:16:42,456 --> 01:16:44,499
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazzo!

777
01:16:55,469 --> 01:16:58,555
Frank! Frank, help!

778
01:16:58,639 --> 01:17:01,642
Frank! Frank, help! Frank!

779
01:17:16,406 --> 01:17:18,325
Hold it, Ludwig!

780
01:17:18,408 --> 01:17:20,786
Stay where you are!

781
01:17:20,869 --> 01:17:23,330
- He's got a gun!
- I know.

782
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:27,125
You ruined my life.
Now l'm going to ruin yours.

783
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,212
- Leave the girl alone!
- I am. I'm going to kill you.

784
01:17:30,295 --> 01:17:32,339
I see.

785
01:17:35,759 --> 01:17:37,969
Two can play at that game!

786
01:17:44,518 --> 01:17:47,396
- You killed him!
- No, just stunned.

787
01:17:47,479 --> 01:17:49,439
He'll be all right.

788
01:17:55,821 --> 01:17:57,656
Well...

789
01:18:23,098 --> 01:18:26,184
Frank...it's horrible!

790
01:18:27,394 --> 01:18:31,523
- It's so horrible!
- I know, Ed.

791
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:34,192
My father went the same way.

792
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:54,087
I must kill...Frank Drebin.

793
01:18:54,171 --> 01:18:57,257
I must kill...Frank Drebin.

794
01:18:58,341 --> 01:19:00,594
No, no, don't shoot!

795
01:19:00,927 --> 01:19:04,806
Jane...it's me...

796
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,560
Funny-face.

797
01:19:08,643 --> 01:19:12,481
I must kill Frank Drebin.

798
01:19:12,564 --> 01:19:15,358
You love Frank Drebin.

799
01:19:15,442 --> 01:19:18,445
And Frank Drebin loves you.

800
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:22,449
Jane, if you don't love me,
you might as well pull that trigger,

801
01:19:22,532 --> 01:19:28,330
because without you,
I wouldn't want to live anyway.

802
01:19:28,413 --> 01:19:31,875
I've finally found
someone I can love -

803
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:36,129
a good, clean love...
without utensils.

804
01:19:36,213 --> 01:19:39,049
I must kill Frank Drebin.

805
01:19:40,217 --> 01:19:42,594
It's a topsy-turvy world, Jane,

806
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:47,307
and maybe the problems of two people
don't amount to a hill of beans,

807
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:50,936
but this is our hill
and these are our beans.

808
01:19:52,437 --> 01:19:56,983
Since I met you, l've noticed
things I never knew where there -

809
01:19:57,067 --> 01:20:00,820
birds singing, dew glistening
on a newly-formed leaf,

810
01:20:00,904 --> 01:20:03,281
stop lights...

811
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:05,033
I must kill...

812
01:20:05,116 --> 01:20:08,495
Jane, this morning...

813
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:12,791
I bought something for you.
It's not very much,

814
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:18,004
but pretty good
for an honest policeman's salary.

815
01:20:18,088 --> 01:20:20,048
It's an engagement ring.

816
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:22,175
I'd have given it to you earlier,

817
01:20:22,258 --> 01:20:25,512
but I wanted to wait
until we were alone.

818
01:20:29,683 --> 01:20:32,686
- I...
- I love you, Jane.

819
01:20:38,108 --> 01:20:39,943
Oh, Frank!

820
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:54,624
I'm sorry!

821
01:21:05,218 --> 01:21:09,723
I'm sorry that I yelled at you
yesterday, I really am.

822
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:13,059
Drebin!

823
01:21:13,143 --> 01:21:15,812
I was wrong about you.

824
01:21:15,895 --> 01:21:20,024
This city and the whole world
owes you a debt of gratitude.

825
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:21,317
Thank you.

826
01:21:21,401 --> 01:21:24,738
And Monday morning
we want you back at Police Squad...

827
01:21:24,821 --> 01:21:28,825
- with a promotion to captain.
- Mayor...

828
01:21:28,908 --> 01:21:33,621
Don't thank me. There's someone else
here who wants to thank you.

829
01:21:33,705 --> 01:21:36,082
- Nordberg!
- Hiya, buddy!

830
01:21:36,166 --> 01:21:39,043
The doc says
I should be on my feet in a week!

831
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:43,047
- And back on the Force!
- Nordberg, that's wonderful!

832
01:21:44,382 --> 01:21:47,677
Frank! Everyone should have
a friend like you!
