2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
Security has been tightened.

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,100
All borders have been placed on full alert.

4
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,700
Exit visas have been suspended
for the entire week.

5
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,100
In addition, we have assurance
from our undercover agents in the West

6
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,100
that our actions to date
have gone completely undetected.

7
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,200
All military leaves have been cancelled,

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,700
and we have doubled the guard
around Dr Flammond.

9
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,700
Finally, all systems are in readiness

10
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,700
for deployment of the Polaris Mine.

11
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,800
- As you ordered, General Streck.
- Well done, von Horst.

12
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,200
By Sunday, the entire NATO
submarine fleet will be here

13
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,700
on their manoeuvres,
and completely vulnerable.

14
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Major Crumpler, what is the progress
of our diversionary plan?

15
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,300
The schedule for the cultural festival
is now complete, Herr General.

16
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,300
You should be pleased to note,
that at your personal request,

17
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,900
the Soviets have agreed to send
their celebrated tenor, Vladimir Biletnikov.

18
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,200
Well done, Herr Major.
Then everything has gone to plan?

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Well, not exactly, mein General.

20
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,800
The American, Leonard Bernstein,
unfortunately has had to cancel.

21
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,600
They are sending
another performer in his place.

22
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:59,700
In fact, we have just received
this copy of his most recent record.

23
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,700
His name is...Nick Rivers.

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm sure he will be quite adequate.

25
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,900
As long as the world's attention
is fixed on our cultural festival,

26
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,900
no one will know what is about to happen.

27
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,900
Once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

28
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,900
After Sunday there will be no one
to stop us.

29
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,200
A pen.

30
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,000
A table.

31
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,500
A table.

32
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,100
The pen is on the table.

33
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,500
There is sauerkraut in my lederhosen.

34
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,300
Come in.

35
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,500
What did he say?

36
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,200
I think we're at the East German
checkpoint.

37
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Better have our passports ready.

38
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,300
This is the first time rock music
has been allowed in this country.

39
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,300
You're not just a performer. You're
an ambassador representing America.

40
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,100
And above all, we play by their rules.

41
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,800
Martin, I've been practising.
How's this?

42
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,300
- What does that mean?
- Is your daughter 1 8?

43
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,400
Your papers, please.

44
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,500
Mr Nick Rivers.

45
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,000
We have been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

46
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,800
- Where are they taking him?
- They are not taking him anywhere.

47
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,300
Do not let your American curiosity
lead you into trouble.

48
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,400
You are a guest here,
only because it serves our purposes.

49
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,000
I suggest that during your stay, it would
be wise to keep to your own affairs.

50
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,800
Good day.

51
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
What the hell did you say to him?

52
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:43,200
I just told him I'd put his name
on the Montgomery Ward mailing list.

53
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,400
I'm sorry.
He's just a little tired from the trip.

54
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Normally he wouldn't say...

55
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,500
Your attitude is being noted, Mr Rivers.

56
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,200
If that was your idea of being an
ambassador, we're headed for trouble.

57
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,200
I want a schnauzer
with my Wiener schnitzel.

58
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,700
from all over the world as our guests,

59
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,300
we wish to express our appreciation

60
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,000
by offering to you these keys to our city,

61
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,700
which will be presented by our
East German Women's Olympic Team.

62
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Tonight, we begin our Festival
at the Concert Hall,

63
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,700
where the distinguished Madam Bergerone
and her ballet company

64
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,300
will perform "The Nutcracker Suite".

65
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,800
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

66
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

67
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,500
Do you know any good white
basketball players?

68
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,500
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

69
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,600
There was trouble on the Berlin Express.

70
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,300
They knew I was on that train.

71
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,300
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

72
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,300
We must proceed nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

73
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,000
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.
It never fails to amuse at parties.

74
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,200
It's very good.
The German's are planning something.

75
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,500
Time is running out.

76
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Have you found out
where Dr Flammond is being kept?

77
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,100
Here, this is one of our most popular items.

78
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,600
That's very good.

79
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,500
We do not know
where they are keeping Dr Flammond.

80
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,700
Only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

81
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,500
What are my instructions?

82
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,100
Here, try this. This will make you
very popular at social gatherings.

83
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,100
Go tonight to the ballet.
Use this ticket.

84
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,300
You will meet the leader of the Resistance,
a man known as "The Torch".

85
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,800
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's

86
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,400
on the corner of Der Fuhrer Strasse
and Goebbels Platzen.

87
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Good luck, kind sir, and God be with you.

88
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,200
Wait. You dropped your phoney dog pooh.

89
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,900
What phoney dog pooh?

90
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:31,800
Souvenirs. Novelties. Party tricks.

91
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,300
And now we conclude our ceremony

92
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,300
with the singing of our
East German National Anthem.

93
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,900
HAIL, HAIL, EAST GERMANY

94
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,900
LAND OF VINE AND GRAPE,

95
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,300
LAND WHERE YOU'LL REGRET

96
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,900
AND TRY TO ESCAPE

97
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,100
NO MATTER IF YOU TUNNEL UNDER

98
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,700
OR TAKE A RUNNING JUMP
AT THE WALL,

99
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,000
THE GUARDS WILL KILL YOU,

100
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,400
IF THE ELECTRIFIED FENCE
DOESN'T FIRST.

101
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,200
Driver, why are we stopped here?
This isn't the Howard Johnson's.

102
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,300
Good evening. A table for two, please.
The name is Rivers.

103
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,900
Ah, yes. Mr Rivers.

104
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,300
I have it right here, but we require
a jacket and tie for the dining room.

105
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,800
We will be very happy
to provide you with one.

106
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,900
That'll be fine.

107
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,500
Jurgen.

108
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,100
This way, sir.

109
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,800
General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

110
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,200
- I have your table ready for you.
- Very good, Heinz.

111
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,200
As you know, Comrade Biletnikov
holds a very high rank in the party.

112
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,500
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

113
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,100
But of course, mein General.

114
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,600
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov could be
persuaded to sing for us this evening.

115
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,300
I will take care of it.

116
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,700
Thank you.

117
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,500
Nick, I'm sorry I won't be
able to join you for dinner tonight.

118
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm coming down with a sore throat.
So, I've decided to turn in early.

119
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,500
Don't forget to be at the theatre at 8:30.

120
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,800
- This doesn't help at all.
- Don't worry, Martin.

121
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,100
Why don't you get some sleep?
Is there anything you need?

122
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,400
No. I just wanted to make sure
you got those new arrangements.

123
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,100
I got them right here.

124
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,900
By the way, I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

125
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

126
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,800
Who do you favour
in the Virginia Slims Tournament?

127
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
In women's tennis,
I always root against the heterosexual.

128
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,200
Have you heard from Cedric?

129
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,000
He was just here. Wait in your hotel
room. He will meet you there.

130
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,200
This letter has to be in New York
by T uesday.

131
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,900
Now, go! Quickly!

132
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm sorry, madam, but this evening
is only for guests of the cultural festival.

133
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,500
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

134
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,900
Jurgen, escort this lady out.

135
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,600
Excuse me, this lady is with me.

136
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,200
Mr Rivers,
a thousand pardons, madam.

137
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,200
After you, my dear.
You're just in time.

138
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,400
I don't think I've ever seen you
looking so lovely.

139
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
- That was very kind of you.
- My pleasure.

140
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,800
I was looking for someone to dance with.

141
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,100
- You're an American.
- That's right.

142
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,400
- My uncle was born in America.
- Really?

143
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
But he was one of the lucky ones.

144
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,600
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

145
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,600
- I bet he's got a lot of great stories.
- Yes!

146
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,100
He would tell me about
the large houses and expensive cars.

147
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,700
How young people waste time watching
television and listening to rock and roll.

148
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,600
- What's wrong with television?
- Not all television.

149
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,200
"M*A*S*H" was OK
and the "Mary Tyler Moore Show".

150
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,600
It just seems like young people
of America take freedom for granted.

151
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,800
Wait. I don't think you're being fair.

152
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,400
My history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

153
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,100
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want,

154
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,100
but still don't know
what it's like to have to fight for it.

155
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,100
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

156
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,700
I am grateful for what you did back there.

157
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,500
You'd really like America.
We've got the Liberty Bell,

158
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,400
Disneyland on both coasts.
It's happening.

159
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm sorry. I really don't know any German.

160
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,200
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

161
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,900
What do you recommend?

162
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
I recommend the pork bellies

163
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
marinated in diced pig entrails

164
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,700
or the roast swine knuckles

165
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,000
poached with flaming hog balls.

166
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,800
Anything's fine.

167
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,000
- Thank you...
- Hillary.

168
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,900
That's an unusual name.

169
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,300
It's German. It means,
she whose bosoms defy gravity.

170
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Pleased to meet you.
My name's Nick.

171
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Nick, what does that mean?

172
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Nothing. My dad thought of it
while he was shaving.

173
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,400
Are you in some kind of trouble
with the police?

174
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,100
Some things are better left unsaid.

175
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,800
Like what?

176
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Sometimes when you blow your nose
into a tissue and put it in your purse.

177
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,100
Then you reach for your lipstick, your hand
gushes into it, and it goes all over...

178
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,600
You're right.
Some things are better left unsaid.

179
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Thank you very much.

180
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,100
Ladies and gentlemen.

181
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,700
We are fortunate to have with us tonight,
a singer, whose great talent

182
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,700
is exceeded only by his devotion
to his country.

183
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,100
He truly has the gift of song.

184
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,300
A golden voice. Inspired talent and...

185
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,400
Is there something wrong?

186
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,800
I was afraid this might happen.

187
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,800
General Streck of the High Command
is a most fervent admirer,

188
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,300
and owns a complete set of his works.

189
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,800
He is a very shy and gentle man,

190
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,800
but perhaps we could persuade him
to sing for us.

191
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,200
Shall we ask him?

192
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,600
I better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

193
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,800
Thank you, sir.

194
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,600
Watch the change
in the second chorus.

195
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, my God.

196
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,500
Your hog balls, sir.

197
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,800
Cedric!

198
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,100
- What have they done to you?
- It was a trap!

199
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,900
They must have known
I was staying at the Howard Johnson's.

200
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,100
- But who did this?
- Never mind about that.

201
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,800
We've got to rescue your father
before it's too late.

202
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
But what are we going to do?

203
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,400
I was...

204
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,300
...supposed to go to the ballet tonight,

205
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,200
to meet a man called "The Torch".

206
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,900
Thank you.

207
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,700
He's the leader of the Resistance.
He'll help us find your father.

208
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,700
- I'll go.
- No, you can't go. It's too dangerous.

209
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,600
I must! He'll be tortured.

210
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,800
All right, but be very careful at the ballet.

211
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Where is the ticket?

212
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,700
In the glove compartment.

213
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,400
Can you reach it from the inside?

214
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,300
How about the other hand?

215
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,900
No, that's not it. Let me try.

216
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,500
Here it is.

217
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,700
Come on, we've got to get out of here.

218
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,000
- Shouldn't we wait for the police?
- That was the police!

219
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,100
In here.

220
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,100
We can get out this way.

221
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,000
- Wait. First you can explain.
- I'm not sure I can.

222
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,600
I only know I have put you in great danger.

223
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,800
Trust me. You must come with me.

224
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:07,400
I don't know what trouble you're in,
but don't worry about me.

225
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,400
I'm a guest of the government.
I can explain everything.

226
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,000
But you're mistaken. They'll put you in...

227
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,200
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

228
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,300
Martin, boy am I glad to see you.
I've been here 20 minutes already.

229
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,400
Nick, I've tried everything.

230
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,800
The Embassy, the German Government,
the consulate.

231
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,800
I even talked to the UN Ambassador.
It's no use.

232
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,200
I just can't bring my wife to orgasm.

233
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,000
That's a shame, Martin.

234
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,200
Have you tried one of these?

235
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,400
Thanks. I'll give it a whirl.

236
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,600
I'm getting worried about this place.
I don't think they've even heard of a trial.

237
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,000
All I know is, after you left the cafe
last night, I met a girl.

238
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,600
Later at the ballet she was alone.

239
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,400
Then I see this guy with a gun at her head.

240
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,400
He's looking like he's gonna kill her
and might have if I hadn't stepped in.

241
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,300
There's got to be someone you can call,
to straighten this mess out.

242
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,300
I figure they've got to let you out
for your concert, Friday night.

243
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,400
They're beaming it live by satellite
to 85 countries.

244
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,000
Just relax and remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

245
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,500
Amen.

246
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,700
We wish to impress upon you, Mr Rivers,

247
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,500
that we have methods of dealing
with those who will not cooperate.

248
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,500
For the last time,
why did you attack Sergeant Kruger?

249
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,500
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

250
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,300
Might I remind you, Mr Rivers, the penalty
for murder is death by firing squad.

251
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Let us hope for your sake
that Sergeant Kruger survives.

252
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,500
It is the hospital, mein General.

253
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,500
What is the condition of Sergeant Kruger?

254
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:34,600
I see. Let me know if there
is any change in his condition.

255
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,100
He is dead.

256
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,900
You leave me no alternative,
but to introduce two of my associates.

257
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Bruno is almost blind.
He has to operate wholly by touch.

258
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Klaus is a moron, who knows only what
he reads in "The New York Post".

259
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,300
I believe they never let a man
lose consciousness

260
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,600
however long they may work on him.

261
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,600
You don't scare me.

262
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,700
My manager is on his way
to the American Consulate.

263
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,900
Do not be so sure, Mr Rivers.

264
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,100
Evidently, your friend did not realise

265
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,900
that here in East Germany
we use 220 volt current.

266
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:21,400
He was found in his hotel room impaled
on a large electrical device.

267
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,600
Our surgeons did what they could

268
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:28,400
but it took them two hours
just to get the smile off his face.

269
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,200
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

270
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,800
Make sure they leave no marks.

271
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,100
Do you know which room
the final chemistry exam is in?

272
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,400
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

273
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,200
- No.
- But it's the end of the semester.

274
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,300
No, I haven't studied.
Oh no, I'm back in school.

275
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
I can't believe I'm back in school.

276
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,300
Thank God.

277
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
Well?

278
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,300
They're still working on him.
He won't break.

279
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,800
They've tried everything.

280
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,600
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

281
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,600
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

282
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,100
We'll break him tomorrow.

283
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,100
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

284
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,900
My name is Nick Rivers.
Who are you?

285
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:29,900
I am Dr Paul Flammond.
I am a prisoner here, just like you.

286
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,500
A year ago, I was close to perfecting

287
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,000
the first magnetic desalinisation process.

288
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So revolutionary,
it was capable of removing the salt

289
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,800
from over 500 million gallons
of sea water a day.

290
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Do you realise what that could mean
to the starving nations of the earth?

291
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,700
They'd have enough salt to last forever.

292
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,800
But then one night,
the Secret Police broke into my house.

293
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,200
They tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory

294
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,000
and brought me to this dungeon.

295
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,700
That sucks!

296
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,600
For the first time in my life,

297
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,100
- I am ashamed of being a scientist.
- What do you mean?

298
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:17,100
They are forcing me to create
a horrible weapon.

299
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,700
- Can't you refuse?
- I wish I could.

300
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,700
But they are holding my daughter.

301
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,200
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

302
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,700
Sunday? That's Simchas Torah.

303
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,800
And the day the entire NATO
submarine fleet

304
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,300
passes through the Straits of Gibraltar.

305
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,600
Is this the Polaris mine?

306
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Yes. By Sunday I will be able to arm it
with a nuclear warhead.

307
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,100
- How does it work?
- It is a magnetic mine

308
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:52,700
so powerful it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

309
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,400
- How about that?
- Oh, no.

310
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Go quickly. If they find out
you've seen this, your life will be worth less

311
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,800
than a truck load of dead rats
in a tampon factory.

312
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,000
Right away.

313
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,900
- Von Horst!
- Ja, mein General.

314
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,000
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

315
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,800
Mr Rivers must perform
his concert tonight.

316
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,700
He is to be executed this very minute.

317
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,700
- It'll have to wait. Call them at once.
- Ja, mein General.

318
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Those bikes!

319
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,100
That is no excuse!
Search the road again!

320
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,100
They're in the Eastern sector.

321
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,400
I want the whole area sealed off!

322
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,600
There's a used book store
somewhere around here.

323
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,400
The owner is a member of the Resistance.

324
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,100
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

325
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,700
Don't you think it's about time
you told what this is all about?

326
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:23,000
I'm sorry, I guess I do owe
you an explanation.

327
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,100
Only a year ago I was teaching
a course in black history

328
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,100
at the University of Blaupunkt.

329
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,600
One night, I came home to find my father
had been arrested by the Secret Police.

330
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,900
I've been trying to find him ever since.

331
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,800
Wait a minute. That's Dr Flammond.

332
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,600
I saw him yesterday in Flurgendorf Prison.

333
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,100
Flurgendorf Prison? Is he all right?

334
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,700
- He looks fine.
- Thank God, he's safe.

335
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,900
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

336
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,400
- Maybe they can help us.
- Let's go.

337
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:43,000
There it is.
It's a Swedish book store.

338
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,400
May I help you?

339
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,800
My father is Dr. Paul Flammond

340
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,700
I'm sorry. I don't know a Dr. Flammond.

341
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,800
He told me you may have a book of
Swedish poems by Von Brieson.

342
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,600
So you are Hillary Flammond!

343
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:29,200
What can I do for you?

344
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,400
We must speak with "The Torch".

345
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,500
That will be very difficult.

346
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,400
But I will try to arrange it.

347
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,700
Can we leave tonight?

348
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,500
It is too dangerous to travel at night.

349
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,500
You will be taken in the morning
to a potato farm.

350
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,000
Where can we stay tonight?

351
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,900
There is a loft upstairs.

352
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,400
You can use that fire pole.

353
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:28,300
That's OK. Don't feel bad.
It happens to lots of men the first time.

354
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,500
Just relax. I'll pour you a drink.

355
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,600
We can always try again
in a couple of hours,

356
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,100
she said, as she laid down beside him
and caressed his chest.

357
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,900
Can you believe they print this trash?

358
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,500
Don't worry about it. You were going
to tell me something about your childhood.

359
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,500
When I was a young girl,

360
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,200
my uncle took me on a tropical cruise.

361
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,300
But there was a terrible storm

362
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,800
and the boat sank.

363
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,400
I managed to swim to a deserted island

364
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,900
with a young boy, named Nigel.

365
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,400
Together we had to learn to survive.

366
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,100
Fortunately the ocean provided its bounty,

367
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,100
which Nigel would catch every day.

368
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,300
Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables

369
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,100
from the endless varieties
of trees and bushes all over the island.

370
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,000
We busied ourselves chopping palm
fronds and lacing them to bamboo

371
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,600
with dried seaweed and snot.

372
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,900
This not only provided us
with a safe haven from the rain.

373
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,900
but sheltered us
from the relentless Santa Ana winds

374
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,900
which would periodically
ravage the island.

375
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,700
The years passed and as we grew up,

376
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,400
we began to notice
strange new feelings awakening in us.

377
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,000
There was no one around to explain this.

378
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,800
We had to learn by ourselves.

379
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,200
Then one day he went fishing.

380
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,800
That was the last I ever saw of Nigel.

381
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,000
I spent months by myself on that island,

382
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,600
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

383
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,300
I'll never forget my feeling of relief.

384
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,600
You can't imagine what it's like

385
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,800
to be separated from your family

386
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,000
at such a young age.

387
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,700
I think I can.

388
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,200
When I was about six years old,
my momma took me to the city.

389
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,900
We went to one of those big old
department stores, and I got lost.

390
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,500
They tried to page her,

391
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,600
but the PA system was on the fritz.

392
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,800
I never saw my momma again.

393
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,700
Some people
from the cosmetics department

394
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,100
fed me a bowl of soup and some bread.

395
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:14,300
Days stretched into weeks.

396
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,600
One February they got jammed up

397
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,400
during the semi-annual
Lincoln's birthday sale.

398
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,900
They asked me to help out
in Pre-Teen Maternity.

399
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,000
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in personnel

400
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,200
about them needing a new jingle
for their radio ad.

401
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,900
So I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

402
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:37,900
that had been mulling and creeping
and crawling around in my head.

403
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,700
It went something like this.

404
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,600
Oh, Nick.

405
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,900
All right, this is it.

406
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,000
I must leave you here.

407
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,700
Go now, quickly.

408
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,900
- Is he all right?
- He caught a cold the other day.

409
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,100
He's just a little hoarse.

410
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,200
Giddy-up, Mario.

411
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,300
- Yes?
- Is this the potato farm?

412
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:19,700
Yes, I am Albert Potato. Who are you?

413
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:22,800
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

414
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,700
Come this way.

415
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,100
- What do you want?
- We wanna see "The Torch".

416
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,500
No one is allowed to see "The Torch".

417
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,300
But we have important information about
my father, Dr Paul Flammond.

418
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,900
We shall see.

419
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,900
- Nigel!
- Hillary!

420
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,600
It is you. My darling, Hillary.

421
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,600
If only you knew how I've yearned
for this day to come.

422
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:45,400
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,
hoping, praying that once more

423
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,900
I would gaze
into your ravishing brown eyes.

424
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,700
Who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

425
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,900
This is Nick.
Nick Rivers, he's a friend.

426
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,900
Forgive us, Mr Rivers,
if we have been less than hospitable.

427
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:06,100
Recently we've had reason to believe
there is a traitor in the Resistance.

428
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:10,000
Du Quois,
introduce the American to the men.

429
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,700
Very well.

430
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:18,900
This is Chevalier, Montage, Detente,

431
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,400
Avant Garde, and Deja Vu.

432
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,900
Have we not met before, Monsieur?

433
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,700
I don't think so.

434
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,100
Over there...

435
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:41,200
Croissant, Souffle, Escargot,

436
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,600
and Chocolate Mousse.

437
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,300
Now, Mr Rivers,
what is the news that you bring us?

438
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:56,500
I've seen Dr Flammond
in Flurgendorf prison.

439
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,200
He told me the Polaris mine
will be ready on Sunday.

440
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,600
Sacrebleu.

441
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,400
We'll have to move out tonight.

442
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,600
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

443
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,900
Prepare the gear for the jump.

444
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,900
Cordon bleu. Zut!

445
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,900
- I want to explain.
- What's to explain?

446
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:19,500
I'm not the first guy who fell in love
with a girl he met in a restaurant,

447
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,700
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

448
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:26,200
to lose her to her childhood lover
she'd last seen on a deserted island

449
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,800
who, 1 5 years later, is the leader
of the French underground.

450
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:33,100
It all sounds like some bad movie.

451
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,500
Forget it. It'll be better for everyone
if we just forget what's happened.

452
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,500
We've arranged for your safe
transportation across the border tonight.

453
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:53,300
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

454
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:58,700
Come, my darling, let me show you
what I've done to the fallout shelter.

455
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,800
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

456
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,200
Life is filled with its little miseries.

457
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,200
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

458
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,200
in a mature and adult fashion.

459
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,800
- Mind if I have a swig of this?
- Go right ahead.

460
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,300
- What the hell is this stuff?
- Gasoline.

461
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Don't worry, my darling.
I'm sure your friend will get over it.

462
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,800
He seems a good chap, really.

463
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,400
How wonderful you've returned to me,

464
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,100
when I desperately need you
by my side, to fight for the cause...

465
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:13,900
- Our cause.
- Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

466
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,600
But I'm so confused.
All these years I thought you were dead.

467
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:21,200
And by all rights I should be.

468
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,900
I floated at sea for days,
nearly unconscious.

469
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,200
Then as luck would have it,
I was picked up by a passing freighter.

470
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,200
I tried to get them to save you too.

471
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,100
It was a foreign ship
and they didn't understand English.

472
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:38,400
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

473
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,700
They took advantage of me
in ways I cannot describe.

474
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:47,400
Oh, Nigel, it must have been awful.

475
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,200
Latrine!

476
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:02,400
- What did you find out, Latrine?
- Where are the others?

477
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,400
We never had a chance.

478
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
It was a slaughter.

479
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,600
We must put a stop
to these afternoon football games.

480
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,900
- Which direction did they come from?
- Up the road.

481
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:18,000
- Take cover!
- They're gonna kill us all.

482
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,300
Take this.

483
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,400
Grenade.

484
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,100
We're running out of time.
The plane will not wait for us.

485
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,300
We'll have to make a break for it.

486
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,000
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

487
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,100
Wait!

488
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,200
Nice shooting.

489
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,300
My man!

490
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,700
Good. Now everybody's accounted for.

491
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,100
Here's the plan.
We'll be taking off at 1 :00 am.

492
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,100
What about the American?

493
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,000
A truck will be here
at exactly midnight.

494
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,100
He'll jump on the back
and be driven on to the border.

495
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:06,000
Wait. Nick is the only one
who knows the inside of that prison.

496
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,900
Well, Monsieur Rivers,
it seems that you have become,

497
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:16,800
how do you say, indispensable?

498
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,600
Indispensable.

499
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,300
That's what I thought.

500
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,300
Sorry, fellas. I've done my time
in Flurgendorf prison.

501
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,800
I got a truck to meet.

502
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,800
Nick, ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

503
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:39,800
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison, I'll never be lonely.

504
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,300
I know how you feel about me.

505
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:45,600
But put your feelings aside
for something more important.

506
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,200
Like what a great cause
you and Nigel are fighting for?

507
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:52,500
- But this was your cause too.
- My only cause is my music.

508
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,700
That's exactly what I mean.

509
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,900
Didn't you see the eyes of those kids
at your concert? You must help us.

510
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:02,300
If not for me, for the cause of freedom.

511
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,300
Latrine.

512
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,600
- A traitor in our midst.
- Well done, Latrine.

513
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,800
I see you have dealt with him
appropriately.

514
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,800
Not the bird, you fool!

515
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,800
This is a carrier pigeon on its way
to German headquarters.

516
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,600
Look, a message.

517
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:29,400
Resistance planning to free Flammond,
Sunday, 8:00 am.

518
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:34,000
That means the traitor
is someone at this very table.

519
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:45,100
Excuse me, aren't you Nick Rivers,
the American rock and roll star?

520
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,900
No, I'm not.

521
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,200
But you must be.
Won't you sing us one song?

522
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,200
I'm sorry. You must have me confused
with somebody else.

523
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,600
I'm Mel Torme.

524
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,400
That was close.

525
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,400
- Perhaps a bit too close.
- What do you mean?

526
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,400
We have no proof
that this man is who he claims to be.

527
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,500
Yet we're asking him to lead us into
Germany's most heavily guarded prison.

528
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,500
- That's absurd!
- Just a moment, my darling.

529
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,900
He came to us with no credentials.

530
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:27,900
The Germans never knew the location
of our headquarters, until he arrived.

531
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,800
And we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

532
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,600
Nigel, what are you saying?

533
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:38,300
How do we know
he's not Mel Torme?

534
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,700
Look, he's at the jukebox.

535
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,600
This is not Mel Torme.

536
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:30,400
Oh, Nick.

537
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,500
Yes?

538
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,300
We don't know
what's going to happen down there.

539
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:43,000
This may be the last time I'll see you.
There's something I wanted to say.

540
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,900
- You don't have to say anything.
- But I want to.

541
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,200
You must know that when we were
together last night,

542
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,000
I had no idea that Nigel
was still alive.

543
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,300
And now that you know?

544
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,400
Oh, Nick, his work is so important to him.

545
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,800
I must stay with him.
He pleaded with me not to leave.

546
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:08,300
I just hope you realise
that's all he means to me.

547
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,900
Oh, I don't know what's right any longer.

548
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,300
I only wish I didn't love you so much.

549
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,200
I've spotted the herd.

550
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,800
They're the key to the whole plan.

551
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:13,600
Now, we're here.

552
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:17,700
Every morning at 7:1 5

553
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:21,200
the prison guards bring the cows
from here, up this road

554
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,100
towards the prison
for their morning milking.

555
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:28,000
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here.

556
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:33,200
And sneak in through the gate
in the electrified fence.

557
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,800
Then we'll break away from the other cows

558
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,200
and enter the generator building here.

559
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,000
At exactly 7:25 we cut the power.

560
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,000
The rest of you come through here,
scale this wall,

561
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:49,900
and Nick can lead you to Flammond's cell.

562
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,400
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal this truck
by the railway crossing

563
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,700
and pick us up back here.
Then we drive to the landing field

564
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,400
where the plane will be waiting for us.
Let's go.

565
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:15,900
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

566
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,100
- But the plan was...
- Forget it.

567
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,900
I give the orders.
Shut up and give me the back half.

568
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,100
All right, be an asshole.

569
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
- Here they come.
- OK, let's move out.

570
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,000
All right, let's go. Double time.

571
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,200
We only have five minutes to get
to the circuit box and throw the switch.

572
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,600
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

573
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,300
- Yes, it's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?

574
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:10,200
I can only see one.

575
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,700
There girl, move along.

576
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:23,100
Stay behind the guards.

577
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,800
Once we're round the corner
we'll break away from the herd.

578
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,800
OK, now!

579
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,400
I think we did it.

580
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:40,800
- Can you see the generator?
- It's behind the feed bin.

581
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,500
All right, let's go. We've got to hurry.

582
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,400
Mon Dieu!

583
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,100
Nigel, you OK?

584
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,000
Oh, yeah.

585
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Let's go.

586
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,900
What's the hurry? Why are you always
in such a bloody rush?

587
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,100
I just wanted to take a...rest.

588
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,300
- The guards have passed.
- How long till they cut the power?

589
01:13:29,300 --> 01:13:32,100
Three more minutes.

590
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:34,400
Then we can cut the wire.

591
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,100
There it is.

592
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:51,500
Lovely.

593
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,400
You're all right now. I'm here.

594
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:12,200
It's all right.

595
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,100
Hey.

596
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,500
Here, here.

597
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,900
Vive la France!

598
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,200
- Nigel, what are you doing?
- Never you mind.

599
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:09,800
Why do you want to go back
to the meter shed?

600
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:13,800
- We're turning the power back on.
- But that will set off the alarms.

601
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,800
- The others will be trapped. I refuse!
- Oh?

602
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:22,000
This gun says you won't.
Now, move.

603
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,900
So, it is you who is the traitor!

604
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,800
Don't take it too badly.
You're no more a fool than the others.

605
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,700
Now, get over there and...

606
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,300
- We're taking you out of here.
- But my daughter.

607
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:03,900
Don't worry. Hillary's with us.

608
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,700
Thank God, but how ironic.

609
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,700
Another day and I would have
completed my tunnel.

610
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,300
Nice work.

611
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:44,600
Nigel.

612
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,800
Very clever, my darling.

613
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,600
You've put the pieces together
very nicely,

614
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,300
but unfortunately it's too late
for you and the others.

615
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,300
- But how could you?
- It wasn't difficult.

616
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,600
I could have returned to rescue you
from that wretched island,

617
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,900
but it would have meant leaving
my new found comrades.

618
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:05,900
Comrades?

619
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:10,100
Yes, it was a Russian ship.

620
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,600
They taught me all about you...
Imperialist swine.

621
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,600
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers. Karl Marx, Lenin,

622
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,100
L Ron Hubbard, Freddie Laker.

623
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,900
Now get in the truck.
We're going for a ride.

624
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,000
Something's wrong. Where's the truck?

625
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
- Where's Hillary?
- I'm hungry.

626
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,800
What happened?

627
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,800
Nigel made me go back to the meter shed.

628
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,600
He ordered me to set off the alarm.

629
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:15,100
And what does he want us to do now?

630
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,800
Nothing, you numbskull, Nigel's the traitor.

631
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,900
Latrine!

632
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,100
Nigel took Hillary in the truck. That way.

633
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,300
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

634
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

635
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,300
Nick, whether you make it back or not,

636
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,100
that plane must take off
with Dr Flammond at 1 8:00.

637
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:10,600
But we recommend you be there
at least 45 minutes before departure,

638
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,000
especially at this time of year.

639
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,900
- Good luck, Nick.
- Let's go.

640
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:17,500
Good luck.

641
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:30,400
You've go to hand it to the Germans,
they make great cars.

642
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,200
Goodbye.

643
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,900
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

644
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,200
I will not leave without my daughter.

645
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:40,200
Listen, old chap,
in a few minutes it'll be dawn

646
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:43,900
and we'll be sitting ducks
to their anti-aircraft guns.

647
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,000
There they are!

648
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:54,000
Oh, Father. Thank God, you're safe.

649
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,100
How I feared I would never see you again.

650
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,600
I am so proud of you, my beloved.

651
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,400
There'll be time to talk on the plane.
You'd better hurry.

652
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:06,700
- But I can't go on that plane.
- But Hillary!

653
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:11,500
I'm needed here. For as long
as a single man is forced to cower

654
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,700
under the iron fist of oppression,

655
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,900
as long as a child cries out in the night,

656
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:20,400
or an actor can be elected president,
we must continue the struggle.

657
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:21,900
No, Hillary.

658
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:25,000
It is too dangerous for you
in Germany, now.

659
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,200
Yes, go with Nick. Don't worry about us.

660
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:31,000
We will hear his music
on the "Voice of America".

661
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:35,000
We will hear it in the hearts of people,
and in elevators everywhere.

662
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:39,300
And as long as we do,
we know we are not alone in our fight.

663
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:43,300
They're right, Hillary.
And when we get to America...

664
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:46,800
- Who knows what will be then.
- Everything will be fine.

665
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:52,700
Things change, people change,
hairstyles change...

666
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:54,800
I want you to be with me.

667
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,800
Interest rates fluctuate. Who knows?

668
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:02,900
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say it now.

669
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,500
Want!
Want more than anything!

670
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:11,500
Take me. Take me with you!

671
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:29,200
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.
I'll never forget you.

672
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:33,000
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

673
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,400
Goodbye, Deja Vu.
I will always remember you.

674
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,400
And I'll miss you, most of all, Scarecrow.

675
