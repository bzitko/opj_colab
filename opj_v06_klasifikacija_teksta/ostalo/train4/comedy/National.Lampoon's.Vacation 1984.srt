1
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,323
"I found out long ago"

2
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:38,658
"It's a long way down a Holiday Road"

3
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:54,996
"Jack be nimble, Jack be quick"

4
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,665
"Going to take a ride
to the West Coast, kids"

5
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,666
"Holiday Road!"

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,958
"Holiday Road!"

7
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:16,294
"Holiday Road!"

8
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:21,296
"Holiday Road!"

9
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:36,758
"I found out long ago"

10
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:43,719
"It's a long way down a Holiday Road"

11
00:01:44,052 --> 00:01:46,720
"Holiday Road"

12
00:01:49,262 --> 00:01:51,929
"Holiday Road"

13
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:57,014
"Holiday Road"

14
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:37,151
Clark Griswold.
I'm trading my wife's old car in.

15
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,444
Say good-bye
to the old gas-guzzler, Russ!

16
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,236
It's pretty exciting, isn't it, Rusty?

17
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:45,361
What's that, Dad?

18
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:46,404
Picking up the new car!

19
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,447
You can't wait, can you?

20
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,488
Hi there, Ed!

21
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,906
Good to see you, Mr. Griswold!

22
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,281
How are you doing?
Rubin right?

23
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,489
Rusty.

24
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,365
Look at him. He can't wait.

25
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,115
So, did you bring your trade-in?

26
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,283
Yes, a guy just took it away
a couple of seconds ago.

27
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,326
Well, let's get to it, then.

28
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,950
We were worried that the new car
might not be ready yet.

29
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,327
We're on our way to California
in the morning...

30
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,411
...big vacation, the whole family,
Walley World...

31
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:12,161
Walley World? Very exciting, Clyde.

32
00:03:12,495 --> 00:03:13,161
Clark.

33
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,537
Well, there she is.

34
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:16,120
Where?

35
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:17,871
Right here. The wagon.

36
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:20,456
Dad, this is not the car you ordered!

37
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:22,331
Take it easy, Rusty.

38
00:03:22,664 --> 00:03:24,624
Ed, this is not the car I ordered.

39
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:29,791
I distinctly ordered the Antarctic Blue,
Super Sportswagon...

40
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,292
...with the C.B. and the optional
Rally fun pack.

41
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,585
You didn't order the Metallic Pea?

42
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,877
Metallic Pea? No, Antarctic Blue.

43
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,419
The Sportswagon.

44
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:41,545
This isn't even the right model!

45
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:45,630
You know, I think you're right.
I don't think this is the car.

46
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,672
This is the new
Wagonqueen Family Truckster.

47
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,423
This is a fine automobile,
if you want my honest opinion.

48
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:53,381
It beats the hell out of
the Sportswagon but...

49
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:55,049
...I want to make you happy.

50
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:56,007
Davenport!

51
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:57,674
I'll get to the bottom of this.

52
00:04:00,091 --> 00:04:02,593
Mr. Griswold ordered a blue Sportswagon.
Where is it?

53
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:04,426
I don't know, sir.

54
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:10,553
I know what must have happened!

55
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,012
It didn't come in!

56
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:16,680
Ed, I'm not your ordinary,
everyday fool. Okay?

57
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:21,223
Now, I'd like my Antarctic Blue
Super Sportswagon right now.

58
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,098
If you can't get it for me,
I'm going to take my business elsewhere!

59
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,099
Where's my old car?

60
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:32,477
I'm just as upset as you are.
Believe me.

61
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,143
Davenport!

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,769
Get Mr. Griswold's car back!
Bring it back here!

63
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,980
And I can get you the wagon,
there's no problem there.

64
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:47,731
The problem is, it might take six weeks.

65
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,898
Now, I owe it to myself
to tell you, Mr. Griswold...

66
00:04:51,273 --> 00:04:53,857
...if you're thinking of taking
the tribe cross-country...

67
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,899
...this is the automobile
you should be using.

68
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,734
The Wagonqueen Family Truckster.

69
00:04:58,317 --> 00:05:00,818
You think you hate it now,
but wait until you drive it.

70
00:05:01,318 --> 00:05:04,069
I don't want to drive it.
I just want my old car back, okay?

71
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,152
I'm not falling for this bit.

72
00:05:06,403 --> 00:05:08,112
No way. Let's go, Russ.

73
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,122
Clark, is that the right car?

74
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:45,872
No, it isn't, honey. I changed my mind.

75
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,790
They flattened our old car
like a pancake.

76
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,667
Are you serious?
Is this really our car, Dad?

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,209
What happened? I thought we were
going to get the little Sportswagon.

78
00:05:56,543 --> 00:05:59,001
Oh, no!
The Sportswagon's much too small.

79
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:00,793
Besides, I got a great deal on this one.

80
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:05,504
Believe me, we're taking
the whole tribe across country.

81
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:07,212
This is your automobile.

82
00:06:09,213 --> 00:06:10,255
Why is it still running?

83
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:12,673
Oh, all new cars do that.

84
00:06:13,047 --> 00:06:14,506
I'll take care of that in a second.

85
00:06:17,549 --> 00:06:20,258
You may think you hate it now,
but wait until you drive it.

86
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,426
An air bag!

87
00:06:24,883 --> 00:06:27,926
You know, Clark, it's not too late
to fly out to California.

88
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,344
We only have two weeks.

89
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:31,678
Let's not get into that again,
sweet pie. Please?

90
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:36,221
Lots of families fly, Clark.
Especially cross-country.

91
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:41,014
The idea of a family vacation
is to be together as a family.

92
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:45,181
On a plane, you put on earphones
and you're lost in your own world.

93
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,016
It's a very long drive, Clark.

94
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,350
I'm looking forward to a long drive.

95
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:52,267
You get to see the kids all the time!

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,352
I only see them a few minutes
in the mornings and evenings...

97
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:58,102
...and a few hours on the weekends.

98
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:03,563
Someday I'll wake up and realize
my babies have grown up!

99
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:04,895
And then what?

100
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:09,147
I just thought it would be
easier to fly.

101
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,939
Nothing that is worthwhile
is easy, Ellen.

102
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:13,982
We know that.

103
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:15,815
Kids?

104
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,774
Do you want to see the trip plan?

105
00:07:19,608 --> 00:07:20,942
Not now, we're playing a game!

106
00:07:21,443 --> 00:07:22,734
Okay, shut off the video games.

107
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,444
Come on, Russ. Shut it off.

108
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:28,320
I know you'll enjoy this. I've worked
out the whole trip on the computer...

109
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:31,487
...so that we get the maximum amount
of fun time at Walley World...

110
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,612
...without missing any
of the good stuff along the way.

111
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:35,988
Here we go! There's us.

112
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,114
And there's Walley World!

113
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:41,449
Now, let's just take a look at Day One.
Shall we?

114
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:43,198
Honey, come on in!
We're going to do Day One!

115
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,868
Okay, now, there's the Family Truckster
as we leave Chicago.

116
00:07:58,037 --> 00:08:00,203
Rusty, please, do not eat the Truckster!

117
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:05,456
Russ, do you mind? I'm trying to work
this out here on the computer.

118
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,956
Okay, Audrey. Thank you, Audrey.
That's just great.

119
00:08:12,207 --> 00:08:13,541
Look out, Dad, here I come.

120
00:08:14,207 --> 00:08:16,208
All right, that's enough, Russ.

121
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,125
Okay, now,
I think we're moving further...

122
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:19,959
Good shot, Audrey.

123
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:21,667
Dad, I forgot. Why aren't we flying?

124
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:26,545
Because getting there is half the fun!
You know that!

125
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:32,004
I turned off the water,
the stove, the heat and the air.

126
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,671
Locked the door and notified the police.
Stopped the newspapers.

127
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,214
I called to get the grass cut.

128
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,381
Did I put the timers
on the living room lights?

129
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,715
Don't forget the mail...

130
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,509
So long!

131
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:48,051
Drive careful now, Clark!

132
00:08:51,385 --> 00:08:52,593
Watch those freeways!

133
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:54,677
Good-bye!

134
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:56,929
I know I've forgotten something.

135
00:08:57,887 --> 00:08:59,596
Walley World, here we come!

136
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,767
"Mockingbird, tell me, everybody

137
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,434
"Have you heard?

138
00:09:16,684 --> 00:09:19,268
"He's gonna buy me...

139
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,977
"A mockingbird

140
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,645
"And if that mockingbird don't sing

00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:29,146
"He's gonna buy me a diamond ring

142
00:09:29,604 --> 00:09:33,397
"And if that diamond ring don't shine

143
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:37,316
"He's surely gonna break
this heart of mine

144
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:40,775
"And that's why I keep on singin'

145
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:42,442
"Did you hear now... "

146
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:46,443
Come on, kids.

147
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:47,735
We don't know any of your songs!

148
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,818
Dad, is that made up?
It sounds made up!

149
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:51,320
I know a song!

150
00:09:51,653 --> 00:09:55,321
How about
"The Walley World National Anthem"?

151
00:09:56,321 --> 00:09:57,321
Okay, you start it.

152
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:02,572
"Who's the moosiest moose we know?
Marty Moose!

153
00:10:03,156 --> 00:10:06,491
"Who's the star of our favorite show?
Marty Moose!

154
00:10:06,865 --> 00:10:09,824

'O' golly! 'O' gee!

All right! That's more like it!

164
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:41,376
Here's one you don't know.

165
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,668
We used to sing it
when you were little kids.

166
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:46,961
"Jimmy crack corn

167

00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:29,764
What smells in here, honey?

173
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,765
Russ! Russ! Your feet.

174
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,367
Isn't this the gas tank?

175
00:12:33,491 --> 00:12:34,367
Yes, I know, honey.

176
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:37,868
Get in the car.
I'm just fixing the license plate.

177
00:12:43,995 --> 00:12:45,287
Do you see that, kids?

178
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:48,495
That's the St. Louis Arch.
The Gateway to the West.

179
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:52,330
It's over 600 feet tall, and there's
an elevator all the way to the top.

180
00:12:54,998 --> 00:12:56,332
Dad, can we go up on it?

181
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,291
No.

182
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,166
Dad, what river is this?

183
00:12:59,916 --> 00:13:02,624
That's the Mississippi.
The mighty Mississip.

184
00:13:04,001 --> 00:13:05,001
The old Miss...

185
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,460
The old man...

186
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,297
Clark, I think this is the wrong exit.

187
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,422
What's the difference,
as long as we get across the river?

188
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:34,593
Clark? What are you doing?

189
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:36,760
Just relax, Ellen.

190
00:13:37,093 --> 00:13:38,427
This is so dangerous!

191
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:41,511
We have no business being
in an area like this!

192
00:13:43,137 --> 00:13:45,055
This is a part of America
we never get to see.

193
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,263
That's good!

194
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:47,555
No, that's bad.

195
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,264
We can't close our eyes
to the plight of the cities.

196
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:52,931
Kids, are you noticing all this plight?

197
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:56,432
This will just make us
appreciate what we have.

198
00:13:57,933 --> 00:13:58,767
Roll them up!

199
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:09,478
I'd better ask these fellows
how to get back on the expressway.

200
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:16,314
I wonder if you could tell me how
to get back on the expressway?

201
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,230
Fuck your mama!

202
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,564
Thank you very much!

203
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:34,943
Hey, excuse me?

204
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:39,820
What it is, bro'!
We're from out of town.

205
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,487
No shit?

206
00:14:41,987 --> 00:14:43,571
Listen, I'd really appreciate it
if you could...

207
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:46,405
...give me directions
back onto the expressway.

208
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:47,906
What? For free?

209
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,324
Sure.

210
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:50,907
Five dollars.

211
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:53,657
I'm not going to give you
$5 for directions!

212
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:55,616
I think that's fair, Clark.

213
00:14:58,367 --> 00:14:59,618
Okay. Here's $10.

214
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:05,119
Keep the change.

215
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:08,620
You see which way you're pointing?

216
00:15:10,663 --> 00:15:11,788
You see that place?

217
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,122
Do you see the sign, "Rib Tips"?

218
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,373
Well, fuck that,
you don't want to go that way.

219
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:20,332
I wonder if these guys
know The Commodores.

220
00:15:21,874 --> 00:15:23,792
You go half a block down the street...

221
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,875
...and you'll see a Torino
with no wheels on it.

222
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,043
Inside that Torino is my cousin, Jackie.

223
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:32,044
Tell him that you're my boy,
and that you're lost.

224
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:33,836
He'll make sure you
get where you're going.

225
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:36,336
You don't want to know from me.
I'm not from this neighborhood.

226
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,712
I'm from the west side of Chicago,
here on vacation.

227
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:41,838
Thanks a lot. You've been a great help.

228
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:46,339
"I'm Mister Blue

229
00:15:47,048 --> 00:15:49,007
"When you say you love me... "

230
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,257
Honey?

231
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,467
Remember when we were in college...

232
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:57,218
...and drove to Fort Lauderdale
in my Austin Healy?

233
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,551
I haven't thought about that
for a long time.

234
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:04,679
Remember what we did in the car?

235
00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:07,553
It's amazing we didn't
get into an accident.

236
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:10,055
Want to relive a fond memory?

237
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:11,722
Are you serious?

238
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,555
No!

239
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:14,806
Why not?

240
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,515
Because, that's why.

241
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:19,183
The kids are asleep.

242
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,892
Let's just wait until we get to a motel.

243
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:30,394
Okay, we'll wait.
I'll find the best one on the road.

244
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,436
Do you want to put your head in my lap?

245
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,062
It's not what I was thinking.

246
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,646
Let me adjust the steering wheel.

247
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,438
There you go, out of your way.

248
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:43,773
Comfortable?

249
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:46,983
Clark?

250
00:16:48,024 --> 00:16:49,149
My head's stuck.

251
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:54,901
Quit kidding around! It hurts!

252
00:16:55,484 --> 00:16:56,485
I'm not. It's stuck.

253
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,944
Cut it out!

254
00:17:00,611 --> 00:17:03,737
I know what you're trying to do,
and I think it's sick!

255
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:07,280
The wheel's stuck, honey!

256
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,073
That was a dirty trick!

257
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:12,823
The damn wheel is all screwed up.

258
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,782
You're tired.
You get weird when you get tired.

259
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:19,241
Let's just find a motel.
I don't want you dozing off.

260
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:21,534
I'm not tired. Are you kidding?

261
00:17:23,325 --> 00:17:25,994
I can drive for another 100 miles.

262
00:17:26,368 --> 00:17:27,995
No problem.

263
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:34,163
"I stay at home at night

264
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:39,664
"By the phone at night

265
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:42,623
"But you don't call

266
00:17:43,165 --> 00:17:46,624
"And I won't hurt my pride

267
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:51,710
"Call me Mister Blue

268
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:54,460
"I'm Mister Blue without you"

269
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,765
Sparky, why don't you turn off
the TV and come to bed?

270
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:42,850
Okay, honey.

271
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,814
Well, wake up everyone.

272
00:19:05,314 --> 00:19:06,272
We're here.

273
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:31,405
Clark!

274
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:33,990
Can I do your back, honey?

275
00:19:34,156 --> 00:19:35,239
I've done it already.

276
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:36,990
Can I do your front?

277
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:38,908
Go do your own front.

278
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,786
We should call
Catherine and Eddie...

279
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,995
...and tell them that we won't be in
until tomorrow afternoon.

280
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:56,621
If we're not there by 10:00 a. m.,
we'll be completely off schedule.

281
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:58,997
I planned very carefully...

282
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:01,706
...so that we would be
at Walley World early Saturday.

283
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:06,916
Sparky, I know what this trip
means to you...

284
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,666
...and that you want all of us
to have a great time, but...

285
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:12,626
...it is a long way to Walley World.

286
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:17,752
I think it would be easier on all of us
if you would just try to relax.

287
00:20:20,377 --> 00:20:21,711
I'm way ahead of you, honey.

288
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,423
When did you get these glasses?

289
00:20:32,757 --> 00:20:34,173
Oh, I have my little secrets.

290
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:39,675
What a nice thought.

291
00:20:46,844 --> 00:20:47,677
Don't drink yet!

292
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:56,764
Ready?

293
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,600
I would like to propose a toast.

294
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,226
To a very restful vacation.

295
00:21:13,477 --> 00:21:15,602
Here's to a very relaxing vacation.

296
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,020
To a renewed love affair.

297
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,105
To a time of joy with our kids.

298
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,606
You know, I've never told you this.

299
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,440
I know it's been a rough beginning.

300
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,650
I think there's something wrong here!

301
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,316
It's the bed.
It will slow down in a second.

302
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:40,442
I got it! Here, hold on to these.

303
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:43,318
What are you doing?

304
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,028
Let's try this, my darling.

305
00:21:49,821 --> 00:21:51,738
We haven't done this in a long time.

306
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:56,906
Oh! Clark!

307
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,615
What's that noise?

308
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,824
What's going on?

309
00:22:02,032 --> 00:22:03,616
Don't you kids knock anymore?

310
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,826
Sorry, we thought you were fighting.

311
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,201
No one is fighting in here.

312
00:22:12,035 --> 00:22:12,953
It is very late.

313
00:22:13,494 --> 00:22:14,661
Where is Mom?

314
00:22:14,912 --> 00:22:16,370
I'm under here, kids.

315
00:22:16,829 --> 00:22:18,036
Go back to bed.

316
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,371
Go back to bed now.

317
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:23,122
The bed was very soft.

318
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:25,163
Weirdo-rama!

319
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:33,041
It's the same street Wyatt Earp
kept law and order on.

320
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:35,626
It seems kind of dirty and touristy.

321
00:22:36,793 --> 00:22:38,167
The Old West was dirty.

322
00:22:38,418 --> 00:22:40,002
Everything isn't like home.

323
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:43,294
If it were, there would be no reason
for leaving home, right, Rusty?

324
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,086
Yeah, Dad. This is great.

325
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:46,879
I'm glad we didn't go to Hawaii.

326
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:47,963
I'll bet you are.

327
00:22:55,756 --> 00:22:56,882
Okay, let's go get a drink.

328
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,135
Howdy, city slickers!

329
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:10,928
Welcome!
No fighting, cussing or gunslinging.

330
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:14,220
Watch what you say
to our bartender. He's ornery.

331
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,178
Thank you, sheriff.

332
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,513
Marshal.

333
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:21,431
Give me five, partner!

334
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:29,016
That guy was a crummy Wyatt Earp!
He's wearing jogging shoes!

335
00:23:29,224 --> 00:23:30,392
Nah, they used to, Rusty.

336
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:33,935
Hey, knucklehead! Set us up
with four red-eyes, will you?

337
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,060
Hey, yellow-belly! I'm talking to you!

338
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:44,855
Hey, tenderfoot!
Move your chicken wings, turkey!

339
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:53,398
Clark! That's not nice!

340
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:55,607
It's part of the act, honey.

341
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:57,733
Hey, underpants!

342
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,026
I'm okay! I'm okay!

343
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,736
I'm all right!

344
00:24:07,652 --> 00:24:11,821
That wasn't funny! A noise like that
could impair the kids' hearing.

345
00:24:14,362 --> 00:24:17,405
It was real! It looked real, didn't it?
I thought it was real gun.

346
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,489
Didn't it look real when I fell down?

347
00:24:19,947 --> 00:24:20,615
What?

348
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,698
Didn't it look real?

349
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:23,073
What?

350
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:24,782
Are you happy now, Clark?

351
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:25,867
She's deaf.

352
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:29,492
What's the difference? It was fun
anyway. Let's have a drink.

353
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:30,950
Pardon me, sir?

354
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,369
Catherine told us to follow 50.

355
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:43,121
I was thinking of taking
a detour to Liberal.

356
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:44,288
What for?

357
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:45,371
The House of Mud.

358
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:46,623
What's that?

359
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:50,206
The largest, freestanding
mud dwelling ever built!

360
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,708
The pioneers didn't have bricks,
so they used mud.

361
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:56,042
They didn't use mud, they used sod!

362
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,208
Right, Audrey.

363
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:59,543
When they ran out of sod,
they used mud!

364
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:02,919
Let's skip The House of Mud.

365
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:05,127
Dodge City was enough for today.

366
00:25:06,044 --> 00:25:08,503
And Catherine and Eddie
are expecting us.

367
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:11,588
It's living history.

368
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:14,172
But, if you would rather visit
your cousins...

369
00:25:15,005 --> 00:25:16,047
...it's okay with me.

370
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:18,632
I would rather see
a pile of mud than Eddie.

371
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,174
Stop it!

372
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:21,507
What's going on?

373
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:24,091
Rusty is licking his hand
and touching me with it!

374
00:25:24,675 --> 00:25:26,342
Tell Rusty to behave himself.

375
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,176
Rusty, behave yourself!

376
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:31,510
But Audrey is eating candy and
smiling at me with her mouth open!

377
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:33,928
Audrey, eat with you mouth closed!

378
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:36,428
No eating in the car, kids!

379
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:37,804
You suck, you know that?

380
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:38,763
Retard!

381
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:40,847
I am trying to concentrate on the road!

382
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:52,767
"I've had some lonely nights

383
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,726
"And I'll admit I cried sometimes

384
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,685
"Cause you were out of my life

385
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,770
"But then you called my name

386
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,187
"And you came back again

387
00:26:07,312 --> 00:26:09,938
"I feel so inspired

388
00:26:10,063 --> 00:26:13,481
"Kissing your lips of fire

389
00:26:13,689 --> 00:26:16,774
"Little boy sweet, little boy sweet,

390
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:19,982
"Sweet little boy of mine

391
00:26:20,899 --> 00:26:22,484
"Come a little closer"

392
00:26:25,025 --> 00:26:26,610
You're driving 80 miles an hour!

393
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,068
Doesn't seem that fast, honey?

394
00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:29,402
Slow down!

395
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:32,654
I don't know why,
we're making good time.

396
00:26:36,238 --> 00:26:38,613
"Love for sale

397
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:41,947
"Appetizing, yummy love... "

398
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:01,328
They're here! Eddie, come on!

399
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:04,287
I can't believe it's been so long!

400
00:27:08,705 --> 00:27:11,039
Eddie, you look terrific.

401
00:27:15,123 --> 00:27:18,874
Come and meet your cousins!
Look how they've grown!

402
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:21,042
You have lost weight, Catherine!

403
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:23,710
She's added a few more mouths
to the litter.

404
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,461
Rusty and Audrey,
cousins Vicki and Dale.

405
00:27:31,087 --> 00:27:34,213
And this is Eddie Junior and Junior.

406
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,879
The little one hanging onto
my skirt is Daisy-Mabel.

407
00:27:37,464 --> 00:27:39,381
How old are you, little one.

408
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:42,382
She was born without a tongue, Clark.

409
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,675
But don't worry about her. She whistles
like a bird and eats like a horse.

410
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:51,926
Take your cousins out back
and show them your worm farm.

411
00:27:53,593 --> 00:27:56,511
Come in the house, Ellen.
I've so much to tell you.

412
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:03,263
Look at that car!

413
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:05,347
That's the Family Truckster.

414
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:09,014
Boy, she's a beaut!
I like those "green walls. "

415
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:11,181
We had some trouble in St. Louis.

416
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:16,517
Well, you're looking really...

417
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:18,058
...fit.

418
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:20,518
This is your homestead, huh?

419
00:28:23,686 --> 00:28:27,186
Yeah, I don't know for how long, though.

420
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,187
The bank's been after me like
flies on a rib roast.

421
00:28:31,895 --> 00:28:33,564
I know the feeling.

422
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:35,565
Oh, fuck it!

423
00:28:41,566 --> 00:28:43,108
I bet you could use a cool one?

424
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:44,400
Now you're talking.

425
00:28:55,153 --> 00:28:55,986
I'm going steady.

426
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:58,237
And I French kiss.

427
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,904
So? Everyone does that.

428
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:03,156
Yeah, but Daddy says I'm the best.

429
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,490
Want a worm?

430
00:29:09,323 --> 00:29:10,074
No, thanks.

431
00:29:11,991 --> 00:29:12,907
Do you have Pac-Man?

432
00:29:14,742 --> 00:29:15,409
No.

433
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:17,826
Space Invaders?

434
00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:19,201
No.

435
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:21,910
Do you have Asteroids?

436
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:23,828
No, but my dad does.

437
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:26,120
He can't even sit on the toilet
some days.

438
00:29:29,787 --> 00:29:31,205
What do you do here, Dale?

439
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,748
Well, I have a stack of
nudie books this high.

440
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:40,291
She's beautiful!

441
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,126
Would you sell me any of them?

442
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,210
Shit, no! I cherish them!

443
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:52,878
And I use them a lot!

444
00:29:55,296 --> 00:29:56,629
How do you use a magazine?

445
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,088
I'll tell you how.

446
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:02,964
A guy taught me something
really neat, last year.

447
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:06,715
Have you ever bopped your bologna?

448
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:14,926
I guess we are 11, right?

449
00:30:16,302 --> 00:30:18,052
No, we are 12 with Aunt Edna.

450
00:30:18,177 --> 00:30:20,844
Aunt Edna? Is she still alive?

451
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:22,012
You bet!

452
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:26,221
I can't wait to see the look
on Clark's face when he hears that.

453
00:30:27,263 --> 00:30:29,847
She came to help when
Eddie ruptured his spleen...

454
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,764
...and she's been here ever since.

455
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,140
She wanted to go back
to Phoenix last year...

456
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,891
...but Eddie wouldn't let her.

457
00:30:38,224 --> 00:30:41,850
Without her Social Security,
we'd never be able to live like this.

458
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:48,227
It looks as though you've really
got your hands full.

459
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:50,520
Oh, it's not so bad!

460
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,854
Eddie says after the baby comes,
I can quit one of my night jobs.

461
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:00,814
How do you like yours, Clark?

462
00:31:01,731 --> 00:31:04,066
Oh, medium rare, a little pink inside.

463
00:31:04,232 --> 00:31:06,484
No! Your bun! Light or dark?

464
00:31:07,442 --> 00:31:08,775
Either way, it doesn't matter.

465
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,402
Vicki, can I help you
stir that? Please?

466
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,153
I don't know why they call this
Hamburger Helper!

467
00:31:19,236 --> 00:31:21,446
It's just fine by itself.

468
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:25,280
I like it better than Tuna Helper,
don't you, Clark?

469
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:27,656
You're the gourmet, Ed.

470
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:34,575
No meat in this?

471
00:31:34,908 --> 00:31:37,576
You get plenty of meat at home.
Be polite. Have some ketchup.

472
00:31:43,452 --> 00:31:44,786
Real tomato ketchup, Eddie?

473
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:46,286
Nothing but the best!

474
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,579
Aunt Edna!

475
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:51,663
Helper's getting cold.

476
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,373
Is that your Aunt Edna?

477
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:08,043
Aunt Edna! After all these years!
And you look so good!

478
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:15,628
Hi, Edna! Nice to see you again!

479
00:32:16,628 --> 00:32:18,045
You remember Clark, don't you?

480
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:24,381
You were the ones who sent me
the fruitcake for Christmas.

481
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:26,298
It made me so sick!

482
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:31,341
I'm sorry. We thought
you enjoyed fruitcake.

483
00:32:31,508 --> 00:32:33,925
Do you enjoy throwing up
every five minutes, Claud?

484
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:35,259
Clark.

485
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:41,177
Well, am I going to eat
or starve to death?

486
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,388
Catherine?

487
00:32:46,637 --> 00:32:49,012
Did you tell Clark and Ellen
the good news.

488
00:32:50,347 --> 00:32:52,305
No. I was just about to.

489
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,515
What's the good news?

490
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,765
You are driving me to Phoenix!

491
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,769
"Junior Pig Competition"?

492
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:14,770
You won this trophy for racing a pig?

493
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:16,521
Yeah. First Place.

494
00:33:17,938 --> 00:33:19,688
Does anyone know about it?

495
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:21,855
Everyone knows.

496
00:33:23,482 --> 00:33:28,441
Vicki, don't be offended, but being
a farmer is not too cool, you know.

497
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:31,359
Oh, yeah.

498
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:35,568
How cool...

499
00:33:36,527 --> 00:33:37,819
...is this?

500
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:48,322
I'm really glad things
are going well for you.

501
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,950
I was laid off when they
closed that asbestos factory.

502
00:34:01,326 --> 00:34:03,118
The Army cuts my disability pension.

503
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:06,743
They claimed the plate in my head
wasn't large enough.

504
00:34:11,704 --> 00:34:14,620
Clark and Ellen don't want
to hear about problems.

505
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,621
No, no. It is very interesting.

506
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,998
Why don't you just ask him
for the money, Eddie?

507
00:34:20,164 --> 00:34:22,124
He sure as hell can't take a hint!

508
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,624
Well, I didn't want to ask you, Clark.

509
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:30,917
Could you, maybe,
spare a little extra cash?

510
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:32,335
Sure, Eddie!

511
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
How much money do you need?

512
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:40,962
About $52,000.

513
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:45,964
Good-bye, baby!

514
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:48,256
You'll send those checks?

515
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:49,965
It's taken care of.

516
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,548
Okay, let's go. Come on, Edna.

517
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:53,883
Lay off, lay off!

518
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:56,842
Well, gotta be going.

519
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:58,884
What's this?

520
00:34:58,925 --> 00:35:00,010
This is for you, Clark.

521
00:35:00,676 --> 00:35:01,885
Oh, what is it?

522
00:35:02,551 --> 00:35:03,510
A gift.

523
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:05,677
You didn't have to buy me a gift!

524
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:07,179
Go on and open it.

525
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:12,596
Eddie, you shouldn't have.

526
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,014
Those are great, Dad!

527
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,182
Be quiet, Russ.

528
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:18,931
Try them on.

529
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:20,599
No, no, I don't want to get them dirty.

530
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:22,515
I told you he wouldn't like them!

531
00:35:23,516 --> 00:35:24,434
I love them.

532
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,435
I knew you did because
the last time I saw you, Clark...

533
00:35:27,601 --> 00:35:29,435
...you remarked about
how much you liked mine.

534
00:35:29,517 --> 00:35:31,477
I guess we better be going.

535
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:42,813
Here he is, Uncle Clark,
all walked and everything.

536
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,980
What is this? A dog?

537
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:46,564
He's Aunt Edna's dog, Dinky.

538
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:48,274
He watches "Family Feud. "

539
00:35:49,899 --> 00:35:50,857
How are you, little fellow?

540
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:57,902
You didn't get to meet Dinky last night.

541
00:35:58,152 --> 00:36:00,402
He had the shits,
so he slept in the barn.

542
00:36:00,735 --> 00:36:03,903
Great. I'll make some space
for him in the back.

543
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:08,821
No! Sit, sit!
Roll over! Heel!

544
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:10,238
Here. Have a good trip.

545
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:11,489
Thanks a lot.

546
00:36:23,742 --> 00:36:26,410

551
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:44,332
Thank you.

552
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:50,416
Rusty, stop playing with the dog
and come and eat your lunch.

553
00:36:57,877 --> 00:37:00,337

a long walk and a bath.

Bite him back!

We would like three tents, please.

00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,848
All right. That'll be $37.

588
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:05,348
$37 for three tents?!

589
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:07,348
They're very nice tents.

The price includes
scenery and wildlife fun.

591
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:16,602
This seems like a nice place,
and it has a pool.

592
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:18,436
All right.

00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:21,186

Please.

00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:33,356
What do you need my address for?

597
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:34,898
We like to send out mailers.

598
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:40,901
- I can't wait to get in!
- Me, too.

599
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:43,818
Let's go get our bathing suits.

600
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:47,736
Disgusting!

601
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,821
You're too cheap to pay
for a hotel room.

602
00:40:56,906 --> 00:40:59,907
Oh, Clark, this tent smells.

603
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Edna, this is your tent.

604
00:41:25,288 --> 00:41:26,956
This isn't very romantic.

605
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:32,124
I don't think there's enough room
for two in this sleeping bag.

606
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,791
Right now, we're one.

607
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,168
One heart beating for two.

608
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,295
Sparky, there's a wild animal.

609
00:41:48,378 --> 00:41:49,046
Yes.

610
00:41:49,545 --> 00:41:51,630
I know, I'm going for it, honey.

611
00:41:55,631 --> 00:41:56,464
Get off!

612
00:41:56,714 --> 00:41:57,714
Down! Go!

613
00:41:58,132 --> 00:41:59,465
I'm sorry, honey. It's Dinky.

614
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:06,009
I'll kill that dog!

615
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:19,096
What do you say, honey?

616
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:22,680
In spite of the problems,
it's fun isn't it?

617
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,347
No!

618
00:42:25,181 --> 00:42:27,932
But with each new day there's new hope.

619
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,016
Kids, let's go!

620
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,767
We're losing daylight.

621
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:36,601
Did you walk him?

622
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:39,019
He took a big one
on Aunt Edna's blanket.

623
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:41,019
Good boy.

624
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:42,520
Help!

625
00:42:42,686 --> 00:42:45,020
Go take care of Aunt Edna.
I'll take the leash.

626
00:42:49,438 --> 00:42:50,438
Roll over, Dinky!

627
00:42:55,564 --> 00:42:56,941
You're tearing my flesh!

628
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:58,482
Good morning, Edna.

629
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:06,443
Audrey, you're next.

630
00:43:06,568 --> 00:43:07,902
No way, José!

631
00:43:09,986 --> 00:43:11,194
What's the problem?

632
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:14,570
I had to sit next to Aunt Edna
last time. She smells like mothballs!

633
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:16,320
It's her turn.

634
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:20,823
For your information, Rusty slept
in his underpants last night!

635
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:22,989
Easy kids! Stop it!

636
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:25,573
Everyone into the car,
we leave in two minutes.

637
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:30,742
Or perhaps you don't want to see the
second-largest ball of twine on earth.

638
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,367
Which is only four short hours away.

639
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,286
Sweetheart, do you hear that rattle?

640
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,662
Where is it coming from?

641
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,080
Beats the heck out of me.

642
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,997
I've been looking for it since we left.
It's driving me crazy!

643
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:51,498
Dad, look behind you.

644
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:55,541
Now what have we done?

645
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:56,999
Will you hold my purse?

646
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,375
Just hold my purse!

647
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:20,965
Hello, officer, what's the problem?

648
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:25,716
Get out of the car!

649
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:35,093
I don't think I was speeding.
Was I weaving or something?

650
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:36,636
Shut up, sir!

651
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,054
If I wasn't in uniform, I'd split your
skull with the butt of this revolver...

652
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,430
...faster than you could
say, "police brutality. "

653
00:44:45,513 --> 00:44:48,222
Officer, whatever it is I've done,
I'm sure I can explain.

654
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,933
Explain this, you son of a bitch.

655
00:44:55,766 --> 00:44:56,767
Oh, my God!

656
00:44:58,934 --> 00:45:02,978
Do you know what the penalty
for animal cruelty is in this state?

657
00:45:03,436 --> 00:45:04,269
No, sir.

658
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,895
It's probably pretty stiff!

659
00:45:09,687 --> 00:45:11,980
You can't think I'd do this on purpose?

660
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:15,814
I tied him to the rear bumper
when I was packing the car.

661
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:18,189
It was very confusing,
I must've forgotten.

662
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:22,441
I'm sorry. I feel terrible.

663
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,650
How do you think that little dog feels?

664
00:45:31,152 --> 00:45:33,820
I'm sorry, it really was an accident.

665
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,821
I guess I can buy that, sir.

666
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:40,947
But it is a shame.

667
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:44,156
I had a dog like that when I was a kid.

668
00:45:47,406 --> 00:45:48,574
Poor little guy.

669
00:45:48,824 --> 00:45:51,116
He probably kept up with you
for a mile or so.

670
00:45:52,992 --> 00:45:53,992
Tough little mutt.

671
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,328
I was afraid you would
get pulled over, Clark.

672
00:46:07,704 --> 00:46:11,038
You've been exceeding the speed
limit for thousands of miles!

673
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:12,205
Dad wasn't speeding.

674
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,205
The officer stopped us
because Dad...

675
00:46:14,331 --> 00:46:15,665
He was speeding, Rusty!

676
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:17,123
No, he wasn't, Mom.

677
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,708
Listen to your mother!
I was speeding.

678
00:46:20,207 --> 00:46:21,333
I was driving like a maniac.

679
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:24,125
We can all be grateful
that this man stopped us!

680
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:26,001
- You see, kids, a car...
- Here's the leash, sir.

681
00:46:26,126 --> 00:46:28,878
I'm going back to get the rest
of the carcass off the road.

682
00:46:28,961 --> 00:46:29,961
Thank you, officer.

683
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:31,961
Have a nice day.

684
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:47,090
Is this your idea of a good restaurant?

685
00:46:48,632 --> 00:46:49,717
Dog killer!

686
00:46:50,966 --> 00:46:52,718
I'm sure the food is just fine.

687
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:55,217
I'll take that.

688
00:46:56,302 --> 00:46:57,302
Thank you.

689
00:46:57,677 --> 00:46:59,010
Oh, kids!

690
00:47:03,512 --> 00:47:04,179

00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,625
Put on a happy face for me.

709
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:51,835
I guess there's not much
more that can happen to us.

710
00:48:53,044 --> 00:48:54,836
I think the worst is behind us.

711
00:49:03,631 --> 00:49:05,714
Clark, I need my vanity case.

712
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:07,715
We have to go back and look for it.

713
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:10,049
All my credit cards are in it.

714
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,717
Honey, number one: I've already
called the bank and reported the loss.

715
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,968
We'll never find it when
we don't know where it fell off.

716
00:49:17,552 --> 00:49:19,009
And three: I've got my credit cards.

717
00:49:19,176 --> 00:49:21,219
And we've still got plenty of cash, okay?

718
00:49:21,636 --> 00:49:24,220
No, we don't.
You gave $500 to Eddie.

719
00:49:24,554 --> 00:49:28,263
And everything has cost twice
as much as you figured out.

720
00:49:28,388 --> 00:49:30,639
Honey, there's nothing in that luggage
that can't be replaced.

721
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:32,639
Except for your diaphragm.

722
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,014
We can cash a check down the road.

723
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,182
Don't you trust me?

724
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,432
As long as you don't tie me
to the rear bumper.

725
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,184
That hurt.

726
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:48,352
Clark, I think we're lost.

727
00:49:48,811 --> 00:49:49,977
We're not lost!

728
00:49:50,143 --> 00:49:52,103
Ellen, please, let me do the driving.

729
00:49:52,478 --> 00:49:56,396
I don't think you'll find
the Grand Canyon on this road.

730
00:49:56,729 --> 00:49:59,355
Jesus, it's only the biggest
goddamn hole in the world!

731
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:00,730
Clark, watch your language!

732
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,147
Make that the second largest.

733
00:50:03,648 --> 00:50:06,440
Dad, I haven't seen a car for an hour!

734
00:50:06,607 --> 00:50:09,108
Shut up, Audrey!
Dad knows where he's going.

735
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:09,858
Thank you.

736
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:11,526
You're lost!

737
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:15,193
Ma, I saw some detour signs!

738
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:16,193
I didn't see any.

739
00:50:16,569 --> 00:50:19,570
I saw them when you and Mom
were trying to fold the map.

740
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:22,487
When they close a road
they put up big signs.

741
00:50:22,612 --> 00:50:23,571
Like this one.

742
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:47,077
I think I broke my nose!

743
00:50:47,286 --> 00:50:48,619
I stabbed my brain.

744
00:50:48,786 --> 00:50:50,245
I just got my period.

745
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:52,537
I'm going to check under the hood.

746
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,542
Audrey, gather up all the clothes,
and put them in a pile.

747
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:11,876
Rusty, find the first aid kit,
then bring the suitcases here.

748
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:14,043
Where can I go to the bathroom?

749
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,628
Find a bush, Audrey!

750
00:51:19,086 --> 00:51:21,629
Dad, you must've jumped
the car about 50 yards!

751
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,297
It's nothing to be proud of, Rusty.

752
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:26,630
Fifty yards.

753
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:30,632
Ellen, get me out of here!

754
00:51:32,007 --> 00:51:34,508
Stay in the car!
It's hot and dangerous out here!

755
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:37,091
Don't you tell me what to do!
I'll do what I want!

756
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:40,342
I should never have come
on this trip with you!

757
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:41,843
I should have taken an airplane!

758
00:51:42,343 --> 00:51:45,927
And he, he shouldn't even have
a license to drive an automobile.

759
00:51:46,344 --> 00:51:48,304
He should be behind bars!

760
00:51:50,012 --> 00:51:52,472
Sit down, and shut up!

761
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:01,849
Move out of that seat,
and I'll split your lip!

762
00:52:10,268 --> 00:52:11,519
Rusty, come up here!

763
00:52:14,895 --> 00:52:17,853
I am going to have to hike down
the road to find a service station.

764
00:52:17,936 --> 00:52:20,146
I want you to stay here
and take care of things.

765
00:52:21,396 --> 00:52:22,355
Will you be okay?

766
00:52:22,564 --> 00:52:23,481
Oh, sure.

767
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:28,982
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you, man to man.

768
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:31,399
I've only been a man a few days, Dad.

769
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:36,068
You're growing up so fast.

770
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,402
I have spent the past 15 years...

771
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:42,445
...developing newer and better
food additives.

772
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:45,361
I guess I missed a lot.

773
00:52:47,904 --> 00:52:50,238
At first, I didn't want
to take this vacation.

774
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:52,739
Now I'm glad I did.

775
00:52:53,573 --> 00:52:56,407
It has given me a chance
to spend more time with you and...

776
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:57,865
Audrey.

777
00:52:58,115 --> 00:52:59,115
Audrey. Yeah.

778
00:53:01,824 --> 00:53:03,326
It's been fun for me, too, Dad.

779
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:06,159
Except for Aunt Edna.

780
00:53:07,243 --> 00:53:09,410
She doesn't mean to be
a pain in the rump.

781
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,078
It's just the way she is.

782
00:53:11,702 --> 00:53:13,329
Let's not let it spoil our fun, okay?

783
00:53:13,454 --> 00:53:14,412
I won't.

784
00:53:15,037 --> 00:53:17,580
Maybe she would be nicer
if she had a family of her own.

785
00:53:18,372 --> 00:53:21,872
Instead of always having to latch
onto someone else's.

786
00:53:24,374 --> 00:53:26,207
You're a pretty bright little guy.

787
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,791
Excuse me... man.

788
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:34,251
It's okay.

789
00:53:36,709 --> 00:53:37,960
Do you know what I want to do?

790
00:53:40,544 --> 00:53:42,711
When I was your age,
my dad shared a beer with me.

791
00:53:42,878 --> 00:53:45,129
And I thought it was
the best thing ever.

792
00:53:57,715 --> 00:54:00,467
When I was a boy, just about
every summer we'd take a vacation.

793
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:05,718
In 18 years, we never had fun.

794
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:10,678
Now I have my own family.

795
00:54:10,844 --> 00:54:12,304
And we're on our own vacation.

796
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:13,429
You know what?

797
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:15,013
What, Dad?

798
00:54:16,097 --> 00:54:17,597
We're going to have fun.

799
00:54:22,848 --> 00:54:23,848
We're going to have fun.

800
00:54:26,808 --> 00:54:28,392
Don't let your mother smell
that beer on your breath.

801
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:30,059
She'll take it out on me.

802
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:34,435
I better get moving if I want
to get us out of here by dark.

803
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:39,479
Good talk, son.

804
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:40,645
Good talk, Dad.

805
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:42,688
Clark?

806
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:52,065
I just had a good talk with Rusty.
You'll be in good hands here, honey.

807
00:54:54,108 --> 00:54:55,191
Where are you going?!

808
00:54:55,941 --> 00:54:58,817
There must be a phone or a gas station
around here, honey.

809
00:55:00,443 --> 00:55:02,944
All right, but if you're
not back in an hour...

810
00:55:03,652 --> 00:55:06,487
I'll be fine. You'll be fine.
I'm sure this happens all the time.

811
00:55:06,653 --> 00:55:08,570
A patrol car will be by any minute.

812
00:55:10,488 --> 00:55:11,821
"Over the river and through the woods

813
00:55:11,988 --> 00:55:13,655
"To Grandmother's house we go

814
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:16,489
"A thousand bottles of beer on the wall

815
00:55:21,157 --> 00:55:22,449
"Four bottles of beer

816
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:25,033
"If one of those bottles
should happen to fall...

817
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,493
"I love a parade

818
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,077
"The trampling of feet,
I love the beat I hear of a drum

819
00:55:33,327 --> 00:55:35,661
"I love a parade"

820
00:55:45,248 --> 00:55:49,873
We pass a goddamn gas station
every 100 yards for 1,000 miles!

821
00:55:50,499 --> 00:55:53,000
But when you really need one,
you end up walking your ass off.

822
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:54,667
This is no way to run a desert!

823
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,625
Jesus! I'm going to die!

824
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:00,585
What an asshole!

825
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:08,171
Taxi. Taxi!

826
00:56:10,005 --> 00:56:11,005
I'm dead.

827
00:56:15,798 --> 00:56:17,007
I'm dying. I'm dead. I'm finished.

828
00:56:20,716 --> 00:56:22,009
Hot! Hot!

829
00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,434
I'm not sure of his
exact height and weight.

830
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,559
All I know is the man was
a saint with children...

831
00:56:54,726 --> 00:56:56,394
...and a genius with food additives...

832
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:57,852
...and...

833
00:56:58,060 --> 00:56:59,019
Clark!

834
00:56:59,185 --> 00:56:59,811
Ellen!

835
00:57:03,687 --> 00:57:04,354
Russ!

836
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:07,439
Audrey?

837
00:57:07,855 --> 00:57:08,688
Audrey!

838
00:57:12,189 --> 00:57:13,524
Are you all right?

839
00:57:13,857 --> 00:57:14,648
I'm fine!

840
00:57:14,857 --> 00:57:16,232
What happened to you?
How did you get here?

841
00:57:16,357 --> 00:57:19,691
Well these two nice Indians and
a man on a camel called a tow truck.

842
00:57:19,858 --> 00:57:20,817
Daddy's back!

843
00:57:23,526 --> 00:57:24,610
Kids, are you thirsty?

844
00:57:24,902 --> 00:57:26,903
- Yeah, I bet you are too!
- You said it!

845
00:57:49,201 --> 00:57:50,159
What do I owe you?

846
00:57:51,118 --> 00:57:54,285
I never heard of no one so stupid
as you driving off that road.

847
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:56,911
You must have manure for brains.

848
00:57:57,912 --> 00:57:59,828
Yes, well, I'm from out of town.

849
00:58:00,661 --> 00:58:01,662
What's the bill?

850
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:08,165
Come on. How much?

851
00:58:08,248 --> 00:58:09,373
How much do you have?

852
00:58:09,915 --> 00:58:11,332
No, I'm asking how much the repairs are.

853
00:58:12,582 --> 00:58:14,208
I'm asking you, how much do you have.

854
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,708
You're crazy.

855
00:58:19,168 --> 00:58:20,667
I don't have time to play around.

856
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:21,835
How much is it?

857
00:58:22,502 --> 00:58:23,835
All of it, boy.

858
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,961
What does your sheriff think
of your business practices?

859
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,427
Audrey, how much
baby-sitting money do you have?

860
00:58:53,511 --> 00:58:54,469
How come?

861
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:56,011
How much?

862
00:58:56,095 --> 00:58:57,179
What's the matter?

863
00:58:57,678 --> 00:59:01,138
I just spent $500
on four bald tires and a tow!

864
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,056
How much do you have?

865
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:05,223
$35.

866
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:07,390
She has $40, Dad.

867
00:59:07,723 --> 00:59:10,350
How would you know? Unless you went
in my purse, you rotten sneak.

868
00:59:10,557 --> 00:59:13,016
Have you been going through
her private property?

869
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:15,558
I don't give a frog's fat ass
who went through what.

870
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:17,227
We need money!

871
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:19,684
Edna, how much do you have?

872
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:21,811
She's asleep, Clark!

873
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:25,062
Russ, do you want to look
through Edna's purse?

874
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:26,145
Clark!

875
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:33,397
Unzip it.

876
00:59:38,149 --> 00:59:39,233
She has 11 cents, Dad.

877
00:59:39,732 --> 00:59:40,817
Terrific.

878
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,566
The motel will cash your check.

879
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,526
They better. We're going to
run out of gas.

880
00:59:50,194 --> 00:59:53,153
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't accept this credit card.

881
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:54,821
Why not?

882
00:59:55,196 --> 00:59:56,987
The computer says
it's has been reported lost.

883
00:59:58,030 --> 01:00:01,656
My wife lost her credit
cards in Colorado and I reported it.

884
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:04,824
The computer is probably reporting that
I lost mine also, which I haven't.

885
01:00:05,074 --> 01:00:07,907
Well, you'll have to straighten that out
with your bank.

886
01:00:08,783 --> 01:00:10,033
Will you accept a personal check?

887
01:00:10,408 --> 01:00:11,575
For what amount?

888
01:00:11,784 --> 01:00:12,575
$300.

889
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,159
I can't do that, sir.

890
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:16,785
Look, I've lost all my cash and
we're on our way to California.

891
01:00:17,035 --> 01:00:17,993
Walley World?

892
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:19,702
Yeah! Walley World!

893
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:23,037
And I'm sort of stuck between
a rock and a hard place.

894
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:24,578
You know I'd really appreciate it.

895
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,330
We require a major credit card.

896
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:32,665
I have $6.13 to my name...

897
01:00:32,748 --> 01:00:34,915
...so I can see we're going to have
to work something out.

898
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:37,749
I've already told you that
I can't accept a check...

899
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:39,417
...without a major credit card.

900
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:44,543
I'll give you a check for $1,000.
All you have to give me is $300 in cash.

901
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:50,087
You can then keep $700 for doing nothing
more than acting like a total creep.

902
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:53,213
The only thing I can do...

903
01:00:53,255 --> 01:00:56,256
...is have you stay here
until the check clears.

904
01:00:56,588 --> 01:00:58,131
Ten working days!

905
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,639
Let's go, come on!
Where is Edna?

906
01:01:28,764 --> 01:01:29,639
In the car!

907
01:01:29,973 --> 01:01:31,224
Good! Come on, get in the car.

908
01:01:31,598 --> 01:01:33,224
Don't you want to look
at the Grand Canyon?

909
01:01:35,766 --> 01:01:36,891
Great, let's go.

910
01:01:47,895 --> 01:01:48,895
Rusty, wake up!

911
01:01:52,396 --> 01:01:54,689
Get out those sandwiches
I got at the gas station.

912
01:01:55,148 --> 01:01:58,481
I'm so hungry, I could eat
a sandwich from a gas station.

913
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,024
There's one for everyone.

914
01:02:01,649 --> 01:02:05,525
Audrey, wake Aunt Edna. It's time
for her to eat and take her pill.

915
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,192
Please, get off of me!

916
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:10,693
Mom, tell Audrey to stop pushing
Aunt Edna on me.

917
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:13,028
I'm sick of her lying
on me all the time!

918
01:02:13,819 --> 01:02:14,777
Be quiet!

919
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:16,862
Auntie?

920
01:02:16,903 --> 01:02:20,654
Honey, it's only a few hours to Phoenix!
Let her be, she's fine!

921
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:22,114
She's not fine!

922
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,447
She's fine! Don't be silly!

923
01:02:25,364 --> 01:02:27,531
She's not fine, Clark!

924
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:28,824
She's dead!

925
01:02:37,035 --> 01:02:39,202
She breathed on me!
A dead person breathed on me!

926
01:02:39,368 --> 01:02:41,202
Her hand touched me!
She's stiff already!

927
01:02:53,456 --> 01:02:54,748
Goddamn it, anyway!

928
01:03:04,709 --> 01:03:07,376
She must have passed away
somewhere near Flagstaff.

929
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:11,170
What are we going to do, Clark?

930
01:03:14,712 --> 01:03:16,046
Well, we could leave her here...

931
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:18,379
...and the first phone we pass,
we'd call your cousin, Normie...

932
01:03:18,463 --> 01:03:20,131
...and he can come and get her, I guess.

933
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,672
That's the meanest, coldest...

934
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:23,965
What do you want me to do,
call Federal Express?

935
01:03:24,215 --> 01:03:27,091
Mom, we don't have to ride
with a dead person, do we?

936
01:03:27,175 --> 01:03:28,175
Please say we don't!

937
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:30,759
Come on, Mom. It'd be real easy
for Cousin Normie to find her.

938
01:03:30,926 --> 01:03:32,634
All he'd have to do is
look for the buzzards.

939
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,218
Hell! Then we'll drive her
to Cousin Normie's.

940
01:03:37,093 --> 01:03:40,637
I just didn't want to get caught up in
a funeral, inquests and all that crap.

941
01:03:41,095 --> 01:03:45,763
You're the most self-centered,
egotistical, manipulative...

942
01:03:46,138 --> 01:03:48,139
Don't say anything you'll regret, Ellen!

943
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:51,140
I'm being practical.
If we drove straight through...

944
01:03:51,182 --> 01:03:52,890
...we'd have three days
at Walley World at best.

945
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,140
Three.

946
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,850
She can't weight more than 100 pounds.

947
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:02,684
Oh, no!
You can't put her up on that roof!

948
01:04:02,935 --> 01:04:03,893
Yes, he can!

949
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:08,145
Do you want me to strap her to the hood?
What's the difference? She'll be fine.

950
01:04:08,436 --> 01:04:10,645
It's not as if it's going to rain
or something.

951
01:04:37,694 --> 01:04:39,071
This is terrible!

952
01:04:41,362 --> 01:04:43,947
What a nightmare!

953
01:04:59,576 --> 01:05:01,826
Don't just blurt it out
about Edna dying!

954
01:05:02,077 --> 01:05:04,078
How about if I ask him
to play a guessing game?

955
01:05:12,871 --> 01:05:14,872
Oh, no, he isn't even home.

956
01:05:14,997 --> 01:05:16,957
Maybe the neighbors know where he is.

957
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:18,915
The moron knows we're coming,
and he isn't home.

958
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,041
Normie's always been flighty.

959
01:05:21,166 --> 01:05:22,083
He's always been a jag-off.

960
01:05:22,207 --> 01:05:23,500
Will you watch your mouth?

961
01:05:23,833 --> 01:05:24,583
There's a note.

962
01:05:26,708 --> 01:05:28,584
"Have gone to Flagstaff.
Be back on Monday. "

963
01:05:30,752 --> 01:05:31,919
What a worm!

964
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,509
It's locked!

965
01:05:59,718 --> 01:06:00,844
Okay, let's go!

966
01:06:02,219 --> 01:06:04,261
We can't leave her on the patio!

967
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:08,221
Would you rather I slipped her in the
night deposit box at the funeral home?!

968
01:06:08,263 --> 01:06:09,179
Come on!

969
01:06:09,263 --> 01:06:10,930
It's raining all over her!

970
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:13,389
She can't catch a cold now, Mom!

971
01:06:15,057 --> 01:06:17,598
Clark? We have to at least
say something.

972
01:06:18,223 --> 01:06:20,182
Okay, bow your heads, bow your heads.

973
01:06:21,266 --> 01:06:22,101
Oh, God...

974
01:06:24,142 --> 01:06:26,977
Ease our suffering in this,
our moment of great despair!

975
01:06:27,434 --> 01:06:31,978
Admit this good and decent woman
into Thine arms and the flock...

976
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:34,270
...in Thine heavenly area up there.

977
01:06:36,187 --> 01:06:39,981
And Moab he laideth down
behind the land of the Canaanites.

978
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,273
And, yea,
though the Hindus speak of karma...

979
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:44,481
Clark!

980
01:06:44,815 --> 01:06:47,691
I implore you, give her a break.

981
01:06:47,983 --> 01:06:48,691
Clark!

982
01:06:55,192 --> 01:06:58,235
Clark, this is a serious matter!
I'll do it myself!

983
01:06:58,485 --> 01:07:01,445
Honey, I'm not an ordained minister!
I'm doing my best, okay?

984
01:07:02,946 --> 01:07:06,488
Lord, we love this woman
with all our hearts!

985
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:08,113
Let's not overdo it, Mom!

986
01:07:08,488 --> 01:07:09,196
Shut up!

987
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:12,073
We know she deserves
better than this...

988
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:16,449
...but my husband wants his
beloved family to get to Walley World...

989
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,992
...to have their vacation!

990
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:21,492
I hope you understand!
Have mercy on his soul!

991
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:22,993
Amen! Let's go!

992
01:07:23,952 --> 01:07:26,911
I hope you children have learned
something about life and death!

993
01:07:27,369 --> 01:07:29,536
Yeah! Don't die unless someone is home!

994
01:07:32,245 --> 01:07:33,495
I think Normie will understand...

995
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:35,496
...when he sees the note
we pinned on Edna's sleeve.

996
01:07:35,663 --> 01:07:39,831
Sure! You left his dead mother
tied to a lawn chair in his backyard!

997
01:07:39,998 --> 01:07:41,040
I'm sure he won't mind!

998
01:07:42,165 --> 01:07:43,498
It's all over and done with!

999
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,666
We'll find a motel and start fresh
in the morning.

1000
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:50,584
I don't want to be in the car anymore.
I want to go home!

1001
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:52,334
I don't want to go to Walley World!

1002
01:07:52,376 --> 01:07:56,044
Clark? Under the circumstances,
I would rather we just go home.

1003
01:07:56,335 --> 01:08:01,296
In retrospect, driving across country,
has been one disaster after another!

1004
01:08:01,504 --> 01:08:03,379
Yeah, it's been a real drag, Dad!

1005
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:06,255
Maybe we can try it some other time.

1006
01:08:06,756 --> 01:08:08,590
Walley World's overrated anyway.

1007
01:08:09,715 --> 01:08:10,673
What do you think?

1008
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,508
I think you're all fucked in the head.

1009
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:20,384
We're ten hours from the fucking
fun park and you want to bail out.

1010
01:08:20,551 --> 01:08:23,135
Well, I'll tell you something.
This is no longer a vacation!

1011
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:24,677
It's a quest!

1012
01:08:24,927 --> 01:08:25,928
It's a quest for fun.

1013
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,763
I'm going to have fun and
you're going to have fun.

1014
01:08:28,888 --> 01:08:30,679
We're all going to have
so much fucking fun...

1015
01:08:30,763 --> 01:08:33,722
...we'll need plastic surgery
to remove our goddamn smiles.

1016
01:08:34,055 --> 01:08:37,015
You'll be whistling zippity-doo-dah
out of your assholes!

1017
01:08:39,057 --> 01:08:41,515
I have to be crazy.
I'm on a pilgrimage to see a moose.

1018
01:08:42,223 --> 01:08:45,768
Praise Marty Moose! Holy shit!

1019
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,768
Dad, do you want
an aspirin or something?

1020
01:08:49,727 --> 01:08:50,393
Don't touch!

1021
01:09:05,564 --> 01:09:07,315
The next time you have
one of your outbursts...

1022
01:09:07,398 --> 01:09:10,274
...I'd appreciate it if you'd have
some consideration for your kids.

1023
01:09:10,733 --> 01:09:11,608
What are you talking about?

1024
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:12,775
You don't know?

1025
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:15,692
All I know is I'm trying to treat
my family to a little fun!

1026
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:19,109
Spare me, Clark!
I know your brand of family fun.

1027
01:09:19,276 --> 01:09:20,986
Tomorrow you'll probably
kill the desk clerk...

1028
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:24,111
...hold up a McDonald's, and drive us
a thousand miles out of the way...

1029
01:09:24,195 --> 01:09:25,987
...to see the world's largest
ball of mud!

1030
01:09:27,112 --> 01:09:28,321
You know what your problem is?

1031
01:09:30,572 --> 01:09:32,655
You have an uncanny knack
for looking at the dark side of things.

1032
01:09:32,739 --> 01:09:33,823
That's your problem.

1033
01:09:35,865 --> 01:09:37,908
You wouldn't know a good time
if it came up and bit you!

1034
01:09:38,366 --> 01:09:39,491
Where are you going?

1035
01:09:39,616 --> 01:09:40,617
What do you care?

1036
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:13,602
Are you waiting for someone?

1037
01:11:15,644 --> 01:11:17,895
No! Do you mind if I sit down?

1038
01:11:20,604 --> 01:11:21,937
Fancy seeing you here.

1039
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:25,897
Having a nice little family vacation?

1040
01:11:31,274 --> 01:11:32,857
It would appear so, wouldn't it?

1041
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,484
No, the truth of it is,
and this is highly confidential...

1042
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:39,526
...I own this motel.

1043
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:43,068
I own the whole chain, nationwide.

1044
01:11:43,402 --> 01:11:44,861
Twenty-two hundred units.

1045
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:49,903
Yeah, once a year,
I travel across the country, incognito.

1046
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:52,446
Check things out,
and see how the operation is running.

1047
01:11:53,113 --> 01:11:55,573
I thought you were going to say
you worked for the CIA.

1048
01:11:58,574 --> 01:11:59,490
That's an old bit, isn't it?

1049
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:00,865
Really.

1050
01:12:02,616 --> 01:12:06,617
No, I'm not with the CIA.
I was, but that was a long time ago.

1051
01:12:07,325 --> 01:12:08,827
I don't like to talk about it.

1052
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,744
No, I'm mainly interested
in my motels now...

1053
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:14,911
And my airline.

1054
01:12:14,953 --> 01:12:15,953
That's great.

1055
01:12:16,453 --> 01:12:18,203
I'm just trying to have a little fun.

1056
01:12:19,288 --> 01:12:21,413
It's a shame you're married.

1057
01:12:21,496 --> 01:12:23,497
I'm in the mood for some fun.

1058
01:12:24,122 --> 01:12:27,790
Married?
You mean those people I'm with?

1059
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:30,541
That's my brother's family.

1060
01:12:30,791 --> 01:12:32,250
My brother's ring.

1061
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:34,916
I usually borrow them on these
little inspection tours of mine.

1062
01:12:36,793 --> 01:12:40,502
It helps to complete the disguise.
It's fun for them.

1063
01:12:41,168 --> 01:12:44,044
It's a good disguise.
I like the station wagon effect.

1064
01:12:44,837 --> 01:12:47,004
Yeah? Well, that's a big part of it.

1065
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:52,422
In order to be convincing, you have
to look and act like an ordinary jerk.

1066
01:12:54,673 --> 01:12:58,048
You know, stop at all the stupid sites
and look like a fool.

1067
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,300
Basically, be yourself?

1068
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:03,092
Yeah!

1069
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:05,259
You like the disguise?

1070
01:13:11,344 --> 01:13:13,804
My credo is, if you have
to have a credo...

1071
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:16,971
...you know, "Go for it," pretty much.

1072
01:13:18,013 --> 01:13:21,472
You only go around this crazy
merry-go-round once! You know?

1073
01:13:22,181 --> 01:13:22,889
I agree.

1074
01:13:23,347 --> 01:13:23,973
Yeah.

1075
01:13:29,849 --> 01:13:30,726
That's my credo!

1076
01:13:35,685 --> 01:13:38,686
You don't have to have a credo, but...

1077
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:40,269
"If the shoe fits, wear it. "

1078
01:13:40,352 --> 01:13:42,978
"A penny saved... "
"Pennies from heaven... "

1079
01:13:44,104 --> 01:13:45,146
My favorite credo...

1080
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,899
...you know "A penny saved, and... "

1081
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:56,024
Thank you.

1082
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:03,359
This feels great!

1083
01:14:05,652 --> 01:14:06,611
Well...

1084
01:14:07,486 --> 01:14:09,069
...are you going to go for it?

1085
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:11,445
Uh... here?

1086
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,279
To start with, yes.

1087
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:16,780
Why not? Don't you swim?

1088
01:14:19,156 --> 01:14:23,157
Sure, I took third in the state finals
in my senior year.

1089
01:14:27,241 --> 01:14:29,867
Yeah, I'm really at ease in the water.

1090
01:14:33,243 --> 01:14:35,202
I'm proficient in many strokes
and I dive.

1091
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:37,745
As a matter of fact,
I could've been in the Olympics.

1092
01:14:40,162 --> 01:14:43,163
Yeah. I'll be right there.

1093
01:14:44,163 --> 01:14:48,872
Yeah. This is crazy, this is crazy,
this is crazy!

1094
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,625
How's the water?

1095
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:53,874
Exhilarating!

1096
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:56,917
I'm in deep, I'm in deep!

1097
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,794
It's cold! Jesus! Fuck!

1098
01:15:08,378 --> 01:15:09,378
Clark?

1099
01:15:09,962 --> 01:15:10,921
Cold!

1100
01:15:21,882 --> 01:15:22,882
Clark...?

1101
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:25,008
Hi, honey.

1102
01:15:25,133 --> 01:15:26,467
What are you doing?

1103
01:15:26,717 --> 01:15:27,842
Swimming!

1104
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:30,344
Yeah, my back was killing me.

1105
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:35,136
And I thought I'd get a swim
and loosen up the muscles.

1106
01:15:35,512 --> 01:15:37,845
Why go to the car and get
the bathing suit? Jump right in.

1107
01:15:39,471 --> 01:15:40,513
It's exhilarating.

1108
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,971
Guess what, honey?
This person here was...

1109
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,473
...here!

1110
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,098
I didn't see this person, so...

1111
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:51,433
...I screamed, that's why I yelled.
I was so surprised.

1112
01:15:51,891 --> 01:15:53,350
You can imagine, can't you, honey?

1113
01:15:58,268 --> 01:15:59,268
Honey?!

1114
01:16:12,689 --> 01:16:13,648
Will you excuse me?

1115
01:16:14,523 --> 01:16:15,731
You have to go.

1116
01:16:17,065 --> 01:16:19,024
Well, I'd stay if I weren't married,
but I am.

1117
01:16:20,024 --> 01:16:20,982
I know.

1118
01:16:22,192 --> 01:16:23,733
I hope I didn't spoil your evening.

1119
01:16:24,067 --> 01:16:25,818
No, it's been interesting.

1120
01:16:27,527 --> 01:16:29,361
Well, enjoy the rest of your trip.

1121
01:16:29,735 --> 01:16:30,735
You, too.

1122
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,406
I can't believe this.

1123
01:16:43,073 --> 01:16:45,907
I am so humiliated.

1124
01:16:48,366 --> 01:16:50,575
Cut it out. You don't even know
how to inhale.

1125
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:52,075
So?!

1126
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:53,660
Maybe I don't want to.

1127
01:16:54,909 --> 01:16:56,077
You're such a dork.

1128
01:16:58,244 --> 01:17:02,703
How can he do this to Mom?
They'll probably get a divorce.

1129
01:17:03,954 --> 01:17:05,079
I better have a talk with him.

1130
01:17:12,415 --> 01:17:13,457
What are you doing up?

1131
01:17:14,624 --> 01:17:16,207
You woke the whole motel up, Dad.

1132
01:17:19,791 --> 01:17:20,668
I was...

1133
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,584
...swimming.

1134
01:17:21,626 --> 01:17:22,584
Yeah, I saw you.

1135
01:17:24,918 --> 01:17:26,168
Russ, come here a minute.

1136
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:33,712
You know I wouldn't
do anything to hurt your Mom.

1137
01:17:35,255 --> 01:17:36,879
It's been a long drive.

1138
01:17:40,297 --> 01:17:43,632
I work very hard for you,
Audrey and your mom.

1139
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:50,134
I guess when you get older
you get these feelings...

1140
01:17:51,718 --> 01:17:54,760
...and these feelings make you do
things you wouldn't normally do.

1141
01:17:56,302 --> 01:17:57,594
Like swimming naked with girls?

1142
01:17:57,677 --> 01:18:00,012
Yeah! Like swimming naked with girls.

1143
01:18:00,095 --> 01:18:02,762
Well, not with girls.
You think I was swimming with girls?

1144
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:04,430
I saw just one girl.

1145
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,638
Who, that girl?

1146
01:18:07,805 --> 01:18:10,015
Oh, no, that's a waitress.
No, I was just ordering in.

1147
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:11,849
She's a pool waitress.

1148
01:18:13,558 --> 01:18:16,641
I was ordering some fish
for you, Audrey and Mom.

1149
01:18:16,683 --> 01:18:17,808
She took your order?

1150
01:18:17,975 --> 01:18:19,684
She took my order, yeah.

1151
01:18:20,518 --> 01:18:21,476
Swimming waitress.

1152
01:18:22,685 --> 01:18:24,352
You understand, don't you, Russ?

1153
01:18:24,477 --> 01:18:25,936
Sure, I understand.

1154
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,854
Do you think Mom will buy it?

1155
01:18:32,021 --> 01:18:35,856
Good talk, son. Go to bed, Russ.

1156
01:18:37,315 --> 01:18:37,939
Goodnight.

1157
01:18:42,691 --> 01:18:43,400
Ellen?

1158
01:18:47,942 --> 01:18:48,984
Ellen?

1159
01:18:49,776 --> 01:18:50,818
Honey?

1160
01:18:53,736 --> 01:18:54,570
Are you mad?

1161
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:57,237
No.

1162
01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:00,738
Do you like that girl?

1163
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,072
Is that what you want?

1164
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:05,697
Oh, no.

1165
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:09,866
How could I like a girl like that?

1166
01:19:10,907 --> 01:19:11,949
She's ugly.

1167
01:19:13,242 --> 01:19:14,200
I love you.

1168
01:19:17,743 --> 01:19:19,368
I'm sorry about everything.

1169
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:22,910
I got angry because
you were right and I knew it.

1170
01:19:23,077 --> 01:19:24,287
I was hurt, honey.

1171
01:19:25,037 --> 01:19:27,579
I'm sorry, too.
It's not all your fault.

1172
01:19:28,204 --> 01:19:29,996
I know you've been trying.

1173
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:31,331
I'm going to try, too.

1174
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,248
I know how to have fun.

1175
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,041
And I'm going to prove it.

1176
01:19:39,749 --> 01:19:42,542
Come on. Come on! Come on!

1177
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:44,709
Honey, you don't have
to prove anything to me.

1178
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:47,585
I want us to have some fun together.

1179
01:19:49,877 --> 01:19:51,878
- Come on!
- The water's very...

1180
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:27,388
We must be getting close.

1181
01:20:28,805 --> 01:20:31,097
We're almost there.
Everybody just take it easy.

1182
01:20:37,183 --> 01:20:40,351
I know we're getting close.
What is that? What is that?

1183
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,601
There it is!

1184
01:20:42,726 --> 01:20:45,185
Walley World, next three exits!

1185
01:20:49,019 --> 01:20:50,603
We made it dammit! We made it!

1186
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,021
The Griswolds are
one hell of a family, huh?

1187
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:00,148
Don't get too much sun, now.

1188
01:21:07,025 --> 01:21:08,359
It's beautiful!

1189
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:10,318
It's just beautiful!

1190
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:13,985
Oh, darling!

1191
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:21,029
- We made it!
- You did it, Clark. Sparky...

1192
01:21:39,117 --> 01:21:40,117
We're the first ones here!

1193
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:45,328
We're the first ones here!

1194
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,204
But we're so far away, Clark.

1195
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,163
And, at the end of the day,
when the lot's all full...

1196
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:53,413
...and everybody's fighting
to get out of here...

1197
01:21:53,538 --> 01:21:55,664
...we'll be the first ones
to get out, too!

1198
01:21:57,122 --> 01:21:57,790
Why?

1199
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,706
Because we're the Griswolds!

1200
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:04,625
Come on, I'll race you!

1201
01:23:16,646 --> 01:23:17,646
Sorry, folks.

1202
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:18,980
We're closed for 2 weeks...

1203
01:23:19,063 --> 01:23:22,480
...to clean and repair
America's favorite family fun park!

1204
01:23:30,108 --> 01:23:31,775
Clark! What are you doing?

1205
01:23:32,442 --> 01:23:33,818
We watch his program.

1206
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:35,985
We buy his toys.
We go to his movies!

1207
01:23:36,152 --> 01:23:37,068
He owes us!

1208
01:23:37,569 --> 01:23:38,986
Doesn't he owe us, huh?

1209
01:23:39,736 --> 01:23:41,070
He owes the Griswolds, right?!

1210
01:23:41,403 --> 01:23:42,737
Fucking right, he owes us!

1211
01:23:43,154 --> 01:23:44,612
Clark, you're scaring me!

1212
01:23:44,988 --> 01:23:46,071
Don't be scared!

1213
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:48,905
I just think someone owes us
an explanation, that's all!

1214
01:23:49,488 --> 01:23:51,157
Come on...

1215
01:23:52,406 --> 01:23:53,406
Clark, now just a minute!

1216
01:24:12,537 --> 01:24:14,495
Honey, will you check
the mileage, please?

1217
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:16,330
Where are you going?

1218
01:24:16,538 --> 01:24:17,538
I'll be right back...

1219
01:24:18,038 --> 01:24:19,248
I'm just going to get
some sporting goods.

1220
01:24:32,127 --> 01:24:33,626
Clark, will you listen to me?

1221
01:24:34,127 --> 01:24:35,461
Let's just find a hotel.

1222
01:24:35,794 --> 01:24:37,461
I'll have my parents wire us money.

1223
01:24:37,627 --> 01:24:39,628
We'll fly home and forget
this vacation ever happened.

1224
01:24:40,462 --> 01:24:44,130
Relax. I told you I'm not angry
anymore, I'm in complete control.

1225
01:24:44,463 --> 01:24:46,630
They can't be repairing
every ride at the same time!

1226
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,381
I think they owe us an explanation
and a little fun.

1227
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:50,965
Whatever happens, just trust me.

1228
01:24:51,215 --> 01:24:52,215
Will you just trust me?

1229
01:24:59,134 --> 01:25:00,676
Sorry folks, the park's closed.

1230
01:25:00,843 --> 01:25:02,426
The moose outside should have told you.

1231
01:25:03,303 --> 01:25:05,136
Yes, we're here to see Mr. Roy Walley.

1232
01:25:05,385 --> 01:25:06,553
What is your name, sir?

1233
01:25:06,636 --> 01:25:07,636
Clark W. Griswold.

1234
01:25:11,221 --> 01:25:12,637
What is this regarding, Mr. Griswold?

1235
01:25:12,888 --> 01:25:16,513
It's a public... business...
summer inspection...

1236
01:25:16,555 --> 01:25:17,556
Personal matter.

1237
01:25:22,266 --> 01:25:25,975
Well, nobody notified
this office of anything!

1238
01:25:27,434 --> 01:25:28,392
Well, I'm notifying you.

1239
01:25:29,185 --> 01:25:30,852
I'll need more than that, sir.

1240
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,896
Have you lost your mind?
Where did you get that?

1241
01:25:38,354 --> 01:25:39,354
At the sporting goods store.

1242
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:40,313
You listen to me, fat ass.

1243
01:25:40,395 --> 01:25:42,396
You do what I say and there won't be
any problems, okay?

1244
01:25:43,355 --> 01:25:47,690
We drove 2,460 miles, just for
a little Roy Walley entertainment.

1245
01:25:47,774 --> 01:25:49,899
The Moose says you're closed.
I say you're open.

1246
01:25:50,274 --> 01:25:52,483
We're not really violent people.

1247
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:53,900
This is our first gun.

1248
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:55,193
No, it isn't.

1249
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,069
What's going on here?

1250
01:25:58,318 --> 01:25:59,485
You! Freeze! Freeze!

1251
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,694
Sit! Sit!

1252
01:26:03,028 --> 01:26:04,862
Lie down! Let's go, lie down!

1253
01:26:06,695 --> 01:26:07,695
Roll over!

1254
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,655
Stay!

1255
01:26:12,364 --> 01:26:15,032
Okay! Let's ride! Let's ride!
Come on!

1256
01:26:16,323 --> 01:26:17,282
Stay!

1257
01:26:23,617 --> 01:26:24,617
This is scary isn't it?

1258
01:26:24,784 --> 01:26:25,993
You boys and girls make sure...

1259
01:26:26,035 --> 01:26:28,077
...you keep your hands on
the handlebars at all times.

1260
01:26:28,409 --> 01:26:29,911
We don't want any accidents!

1261
01:26:30,078 --> 01:26:31,078
Is that a real gun, Mom?

1262
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:34,453
I don't know.
But when this is all over...

1263
01:26:35,204 --> 01:26:37,704
...your father may be going away
for a little while.

1264
01:26:37,871 --> 01:26:39,122
Boy, I sure am bushed!

1265
01:26:39,206 --> 01:26:40,206
Have you had enough yet, sir?

1266
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:42,581
What do you mean "bushed"?

1267
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,539
Where are the big rides?
The big ones?

1268
01:26:52,541 --> 01:26:53,626
Let's go. Get in the front.

1269
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:54,709
Come on.

1270
01:26:59,586 --> 01:27:01,419
Has your father ever
killed anyone before?

1271
01:27:02,336 --> 01:27:03,295
Just a dog.

1272
01:27:03,629 --> 01:27:04,963
Oh, and my Aunt Edna.

1273
01:27:05,088 --> 01:27:06,922
Hey! You can't prove that, Rusty.

1274
01:27:10,339 --> 01:27:12,006
Rusty? May I call you Rusty?

1275
01:27:13,173 --> 01:27:15,298
I had a bad experience
on this ride once before.

1276
01:27:16,007 --> 01:27:16,967
What happened?

1277
01:27:17,716 --> 01:27:18,675
I threw up.

1278
01:27:34,263 --> 01:27:35,222
Now, don't do that again!

1279
01:29:14,126 --> 01:29:15,542
Goodie, goodie, goodie!
The Loop-D-Loop!

1280
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:17,376
Come on, get in there.
Let's go, huh, kids?

1281
01:29:17,543 --> 01:29:18,501
Please, don't push!

1282
01:29:18,543 --> 01:29:20,586
Come on, Audrey.
Isn't this fun, honey?

1283
01:29:24,004 --> 01:29:25,420
That's not a real gun, is it, Clark?

1284
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:28,296
What? Are you kidding?!
This is a Magnum P.I.!

1285
01:29:28,671 --> 01:29:29,629
It's a BB-gun!

1286
01:29:30,422 --> 01:29:32,172
Don't try me.
I could put your eye out with this.

1287
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,007
You couldn't even break skin with that.

1288
01:29:34,339 --> 01:29:35,965
It could! It could break the skin.

1289
01:29:36,339 --> 01:29:39,174
It could put a lodge under the skin
and cause a bad infection.

1290
01:29:39,257 --> 01:29:40,758
That's an old wives' tale, Clark!

1291
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:41,800
I'm telling.

1292
01:29:45,426 --> 01:29:47,093
See, I told you! I warned you!

1293
01:29:47,342 --> 01:29:48,886
If you wrecked the pants,
you'll pay for them!

1294
01:29:48,969 --> 01:29:49,969
Yeah, I'll pay for 'em.

1295
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:05,157
Freeze!

1296
01:31:09,617 --> 01:31:10,367
Don't shoot!

1297
01:31:14,702 --> 01:31:16,036
Hands behind your heads!

1298
01:31:16,703 --> 01:31:17,661
Spread your legs!

1299
01:31:18,953 --> 01:31:20,412
Move up against the wall!

1300
01:31:20,621 --> 01:31:21,954
You two, over there!

1301
01:31:25,371 --> 01:31:26,288
It's just a BB-gun!

1302
01:31:26,705 --> 01:31:28,040
You are all under arrest.

1303
01:31:28,873 --> 01:31:30,206
You have the right to remain silent.

1304
01:31:31,707 --> 01:31:33,373
Watch your hands, mister!

1305
01:31:40,710 --> 01:31:41,585
How many are there?

1306
01:31:41,710 --> 01:31:42,710
A lot of them?

1307
01:31:44,419 --> 01:31:46,419
Whatever they want...
We'll pay 'em! We'll pay 'em!

1308
01:31:46,503 --> 01:31:47,377
Tell me, what is going on?

1309
01:31:47,879 --> 01:31:49,712
Everything's under control, sir.
They are terrorists!

1310
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:50,462
Where?

1311
01:31:51,213 --> 01:31:51,880
Them?

1312
01:31:53,713 --> 01:31:55,048
He treated me like a dog!

1313
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:56,714
He humiliated me!

1314
01:31:57,339 --> 01:31:58,215
What did he do with your dog?

1315
01:31:58,298 --> 01:32:00,048
He kidnapped me, Mr. Wally,
but I gotta tell you...

1316
01:32:00,131 --> 01:32:01,299
...I had a great time on your rides.

1317
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:02,925
It was the most fantastic
experience I've ever had!

1318
01:32:03,008 --> 01:32:04,967
I like the part where you go
really way up high...

1319
01:32:05,009 --> 01:32:07,509
I'm glad you liked it.
Now, what's happening?

1320
01:32:07,717 --> 01:32:08,802
That is Roy Walley, honey!

1321
01:32:10,093 --> 01:32:12,594
I'm Russ Lasky. I met you
at the summer picnic last year.

1322
01:32:13,803 --> 01:32:14,511
I don't remember.

1323
01:32:14,552 --> 01:32:15,720
They kidnapped one of my men.

1324
01:32:15,845 --> 01:32:16,804
I was the one who got sick.

1325
01:32:17,053 --> 01:32:19,054
Anyway Mr. Wally,
I went on all the rides...

1326
01:32:19,137 --> 01:32:21,931
...I didn't get sick this time.
Normally I get sick on all your rides...

1327
01:32:22,014 --> 01:32:22,639
Quiet!

1328
01:32:25,723 --> 01:32:27,723
Mr. Walley... Roy?

1329
01:32:29,265 --> 01:32:31,391
I think I can make
some sense out of this.

1330
01:32:31,766 --> 01:32:33,433
Well, someone had better explain!

1331
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:36,267
Or there will be a lot
of explaining to do!

1332
01:32:37,267 --> 01:32:38,768
I'm Clark W. Griswold.

1333
01:32:40,852 --> 01:32:42,310
This is my wife, Ellen.

1334
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:46,562
Hi. We're big fans of yours.
We watch your show all the time.

1335
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:50,063
These are my children, Audrey and Rusty.

1336
01:32:50,522 --> 01:32:51,355
Nice family.

1337
01:32:54,606 --> 01:32:56,524
We're from Chicago, Roy.
"The Windy City. "

1338
01:32:56,774 --> 01:32:58,273
I've been there many times.

1339
01:32:58,691 --> 01:33:02,775
We just spent two weeks
of living hell, driving out here.

1340
01:33:04,734 --> 01:33:07,110
We lost a dear member
of the family on the way.

1341
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:12,027
But, the important thing,
Roy, is that...

1342
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:14,153
...we could have gone anywhere
we wanted to this summer.

1343
01:33:14,237 --> 01:33:15,445
Anywhere in the world.

1344
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:17,154
But when I asked my kids...

1345
01:33:18,655 --> 01:33:21,656
Kids, remember when I asked you
where you wanted to go on vacation?

1346
01:33:22,155 --> 01:33:23,114
What did you say?

1347
01:33:23,239 --> 01:33:23,865
Hawaii?

1348
01:33:24,824 --> 01:33:25,657
Shut up, Russ.

1349
01:33:25,824 --> 01:33:26,824
Audrey, you remember?

1350
01:33:27,991 --> 01:33:28,991
Walley World, Dad?

1351
01:33:29,658 --> 01:33:32,075
"Walley World, Dad! "
Roy Walley World.

1352
01:33:33,827 --> 01:33:35,660
Do you have any children, Mr. Walley?

1353
01:33:35,827 --> 01:33:37,411
Are you kidding? I have seven.

1354
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:38,244
I thought so.

1355
01:33:38,828 --> 01:33:40,369
Seven, did you hear that, honey?

1356
01:33:40,912 --> 01:33:41,870
You look so young!

1357
01:33:45,496 --> 01:33:47,162
Did you ever drive them across country?

1358
01:33:48,747 --> 01:33:50,414
I took the whole clan
to Florida one year.

1359
01:33:50,747 --> 01:33:52,915
The worst two weeks
I ever had in my life.

1360
01:33:53,331 --> 01:33:55,499
The smell from the backseat
was too unbearable.

1361
01:33:56,582 --> 01:33:57,541
I know that smell.

1362
01:34:02,376 --> 01:34:05,544
Imagine how your kids would
have felt if Florida had been closed.

1363
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,419
They don't close Florida.

1364
01:34:07,544 --> 01:34:10,044
I know they don't close
the state of Florida.

1365
01:34:11,546 --> 01:34:13,754
When we got here,
to Roy Walley World...

1366
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:15,880
...and it was closed down...

1367
01:34:16,547 --> 01:34:18,715
If you had seen the look
on my kids faces.

1368
01:34:18,964 --> 01:34:20,298
I guess I went a little haywire.

1369
01:34:20,464 --> 01:34:22,257
You went a lot haywire,
if you ask me!

1370
01:34:22,382 --> 01:34:23,382
I'm very sorry, sir.

1371
01:34:23,882 --> 01:34:25,383
I'm sorry to all these people.

1372
01:34:25,717 --> 01:34:27,216
I didn't mean any harm.

1373
01:34:27,966 --> 01:34:29,718
I want you to ask yourself one thing.

1374
01:34:31,967 --> 01:34:33,176
If you were me...

1375
01:34:33,343 --> 01:34:35,511
...wouldn't you have done
the same thing for your children?

1376
01:34:36,511 --> 01:34:37,511
No.

1377
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:41,053
Mr. Walley, do you want me to take
them downtown and book them?

1378
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:47,180
No... no.

1379
01:34:47,306 --> 01:34:50,056
Forget it, officer.
I'm not going to press any charges.

1380
01:34:56,142 --> 01:34:57,933
What did I tell ya?
Did I say trust me?
