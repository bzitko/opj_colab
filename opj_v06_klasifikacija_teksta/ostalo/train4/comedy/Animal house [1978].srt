FABER COLLEGE - 1962

3
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,058
Take off that beanie.

4
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,853
-We're meant to wear them to homecoming.
-Don't be a fruit, okay?

5
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,858
Okay.

6
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,160
Doug Neidermeyer,
Omega membership chairman.

7
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,495
Larry Kroger.

8
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,875
This is my roommate, Kent Dorfman.

9
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,878
Hi there. Doug Neidermeyer.

10
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,757
And These are our name-tag hostesses,
Mandy Pepperidge and Babs Jansen.

11
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,260
-Hi there, Kent.
-Hi, Larry.

12
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,387
-Welcome to Omega house.
-Thank you.

13
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,974
-Nice to--
-Why don't we go meet some of the guys?

14
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,274
A wimp and a blimp.

15
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,780
There are many great guys here,
so don't feel you have to meet everyone.

16
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,786
We just want you to enjoy yourselves
while you're here.

17
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,457
...Omega house has more activities...

18
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:30,669
than most campus fraternities,
is far superior....

19
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,254
-Mandy.
-Hi.

20
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,589
Right there.

21
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,093
Hi there, fellows. Meet Ken and Lonny.

22
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,595
Larry.

23
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,973
Ken, Lonny, l'd like you to meet...

24
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,391
Mohammet...

25
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,769
Jugdish, Sidney and Clayton.

26
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,190
Grab a seat and make yourselves at home.

27
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,860
Don't be shy about helping yourselves
to punch and cookies.

28
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,086
l'm not going to say Omega's
the best house on campus...

29
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:18,467
but a lot of outstanding guys figure
they'll pledge Omega or won't pledge at all.

30
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,887
We do have more than our share of
campus leaders...

31
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,973
something that never looks bad on
your permanent record.

32
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,269
Sure. Everybody says Omega's the best,
but...

33
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,688
I hate to seem...

34
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,690
you know, pushy.

35
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,861
Let the unacceptable candidates worry,
because after tonight, they're....

36
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:41,281
...you are...Kent!

37
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,159
I'm Greg Marmalard,
president of Omega House.

38
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,662
Meet my friends, Mandy Pepperidge...

39
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,956
We already met.

40
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,166
-...and Chip Diller.
-How are you?

41
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,376
How are you?

42
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,088
Over there is Terry Auerback,
captain of the swim team.

43
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,966
That's Carl Phillips,
editor of the Daily Faberian.

44
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,175
And...

45
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,385
Clayton.

46
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,970
Sidney.

47
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,681
Jugdish, Mohammet, Lonny--

48
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,183
-We already met.
-Super!

49
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,395
Then you'll have lots to talk about.

50
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:20,070
-I don't think you're trying very hard.
-I hate this.

51
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:24,366
No sweat. My brother Fred was a Delta
That makes me a legacy.

52
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,871
They have to take me. It's their law.
Don't worry. I'll put in a good word for you.

53
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,790
Great. I heard Delta's
the worst house on campus.

54
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,889
Excuse me, sir.
Is this the Delta house?

55
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,182
Sure.

56
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,894
Come on in.

57
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,677
Grab a brew.

58
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,763
Don't cost nothing.

59
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,064
See you later.

60
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,170
And bump you $20.

61
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,880
Hi, guys.

62
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,177
You guys playing cards?

63
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,862
You want another beer?

64
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,657
Hi.

65
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,369
-You want a beer... Larry?
-Sure.

66
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,582
Nice fish.

67
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,671
-I'm Robert Hoover, chapter president.
-Hi, Robert.

68
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,091
-Have you seen Boon?
-He disappeared when we got here.

69
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,385
He's probably upstairs talking to Otter.

70
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:49,761
No doubt.

71
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,264
They're well-known homosexuals.

72
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,475
Have another beer. She's just kidding.

73
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,686
Right, Bluto?

74
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,786
You going out tonight, Otter?

75
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,289
Norma?

76
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,585
No. Let me give you a hint.
She's got a couple of major-league yabos.

77
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,462
-Beverly!
-No.

78
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,088
But you're getting warmer.

79
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,091
Let me give you another hint.
Does this ring a bell?

80
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:32,387
-"Oh, God. Oh, God!"
-Marlene.

81
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,390
You're going to pork Marlene Desmond?

82
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,268
-Pork?
-You're gonna hump her brains out.

83
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:43,065
I anticipate a deeply religious experience.

84
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,486
Why the interest in my social life?
Where's Katy?

85
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,072
Downstairs, pissed off about something.

86
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,366
She thinks you're an immature jerk?

87
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,492
Yeah.

88
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,078
I don't take anything seriously.

89
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,378
She'll take this seriously.

90
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,963
Try it.

91
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,465
-You guys coming down?
-This thing talk?

92
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,969
There are 50 people trying
to get into this fraternity.

93
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:16,181
Otter, you are the rush chairman.
You should be present at the rush party.

94
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,483
Hi. My name is Kent Dorfman.

95
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,993
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

96
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,662
D-Day!

97
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,457
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

98
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,170
That was Eric Stratton.
He was damn glad to meet you.

99
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:51,175
Larry, l see you've met D-Day.
You're having a nice time. That's good.

100
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,856
Eric Stratton. 
Damn glad to meet you.

101
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,774
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice tie!

102
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,195
Is that a clip-on?
Boon, come check this out.

103
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,488
Excuse me. Pardon me.

104
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,494
Ninety percent rayon! Very nice.

105
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,456
Hi, boys. Having a good time, l hope?

106
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,583
Excuse me.

107
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,877
-Did your mother buy that?
-Yes.

108
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,672
Kent is a legacy, Otter.
His brother was a '59. Fred Dorfman.

109
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,675
He said legacies get asked to pledge
automatically.

110
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,181
Usually, unless the pledge in question
is a real closet case, like Fred.

111
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,266
-My brother.
-Kent, come over here.

112
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,393
-I liked the tie.
-Great tie.

113
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:44,770
Katy.

114
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,859
Eric Stratton, rush chairman.
Damn glad to meet you.

115
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:53,987
Katy!

116
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,493
-Where are you going?
-Home.

117
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,788
-We just got here!
-No, you just got here.

118
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:07,084
I've been downstairs entertaining
some kid from Pig's Knuckle, Arkansas.

119
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:12,673
Maybe we could drive to your folks' place
this weekend.

120
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,675
Fabulous.

121
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:19,263
My car filled with your beer buddies going up
to empty my parents' liquor cabinet?

122
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,682
It's too depressing to think about.

123
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:26,395
Just you and me, 
and Otter and another girl.

124
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:29,857
Is this what you're going to do
for the rest of your life?

125
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,358
What do you mean?

126
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,695
Hanging around with animals,
getting drunk every weekend?

127
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,988
No.

128
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,656
After l graduate...

129
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,367
I'm going to get drunk every night.

130
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,083
I think l'm in love with a retard.

131
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,793
Is he bigger than me?

132
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,266
Greg...

133
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,978
what is the worst fraternity on this campus?

134
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:13,192
That would be hard to say, sir.
They're each outstanding in their own way--

135
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,653
Cut the horseshit, son.
I've got their disciplinary files here.

136
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,994
Who dumped a whole truckload of fizzies
into the swim meet?

137
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,665
Who delivered the medical-school cadavers
to the alumni dinner?

138
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,878
Every Halloween, the trees are filled
with underwear.

139
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:36,757
Every spring, the toilets explode.

140
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,885
You're talking about Delta, sir.

141
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:43,889
Of course l'm talking about Delta,
you twerp!

142
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,391
This year, it's gonna be different.

143
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,853
This year we'll grab the bull by the balls...

144
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,564
and kick those punks off campus!

145
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:56,360
What do you intend to do, sir?
Delta's already on probation.

146
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,070
-They are?
-Yes, sir.

147
00:12:58,862 --> 00:12:59,863
Oh....

148
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,576
Then as of now,
they're on double secret probation!

149
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,079
Double secret probation, sir?

150
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:11,166
There is a little-known codicil
in the Faber College Constitution...

151
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:14,795
which gives the Dean unlimited power
to preserve order...

152
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,964
in time of campus emergency.

153
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:21,260
Find me a way to revoke Delta's charter.

154
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,555
You live next door.

155
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:28,976
Put Neidermeyer on it.
He's a sneaky little shit just like you, right?

156
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,356
The time has come for someone
to put his foot down.

157
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,484
And that foot is me.

158
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:42,489
Larry Kroger. All in favour.

159
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,868
We need the dues.

160
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:50,164
Good. Larry Kroger is now a pledge
to Delta Next slide, please.

161
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,678
Just a minute! Just settle down!

162
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,764
This is Kent Dorfman.
He's a legacy from Harrisburg.

163
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,564
Now wait a minute!

164
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:19,359
Okay, this guy is a real zero.
That's true.

165
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,988
Think back to when you were freshmen.

166
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,784
Boon, you had a face like a pepperoni pizza,
right?

167
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:32,080
And Stork here. Everybody thought
that Stork was brain damaged.

168
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,792
I myself was so obnoxious...

169
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,462
the seniors beat me up once a week.

170
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:41,882
So this guy is a total loser?

171
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:46,553
Let me tell you the story of another loser.

172
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,061
Get up!

173
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,274
Let's go! On your feet!

174
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,363
"l...." State your name.

175
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,074
l...state your name.

176
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,160
"...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat."

177
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,580
...do hereby pledge allegiance to the frat.

178
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,668
"With liberty and fraternity for all."

179
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,378
Amen.

180
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,088
Sergeant at Arms...

181
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,465
do your duty.

182
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:30,973
From now on,
your Delta Tau Chi name is Weasel.

183
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,894
From now on your name is Mothball.

184
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:41,358
Kroger, 
your Delta Tau Chi name is Pinto.

185
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,569
-Why Pinto?
-Why not?

186
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:46,989
What's my Delta Tau Chi name?

187
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:51,076
Dorfman, 
l've given this a lot of thought.

188
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,370
From now on...

189
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,873
your name is Flounder.

190
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,084
Flounder?

191
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,094
We now consecrate 
the bond of obedience.

192
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,853
Assume the position.

193
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,862
Thank you, sir. 
May l have another?

194
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,866
Thank you, sir. 
May l have another?

195
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,495
Thank you, sir. 
May l have another?

196
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,083
Now, what can we say...

197
00:17:23,168 --> 00:17:24,878
of John Milton's...

198
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,464
Paradise Lost?

199
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,093
It's a Iong poem, written...

200
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,762
a Iong time ago, and l'm sure...

201
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,266
a Iot of you have 
difficulty understanding...

202
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,769
exactly what Milton was trying to say.

203
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,564
Certainly we know 
that he was trying to...

204
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,568
describe the struggle 
between good and evil, right?

205
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:51,655
Okay.

206
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:56,368
The most intriguing character,
as we all know from our reading, was...

207
00:17:58,662 --> 00:17:59,663
Satan.

208
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,169
Now was Milton trying to tell us...

209
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,255
that being bad was more fun
than being good?

210
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,182
Okay.

211
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:23,187
Don't write this down,
but l find Milton probably...

212
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,981
as boring as you find Milton.

213
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,776
Mrs. Milton found him boring, too.

214
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,154
He's a little bit long-winded...

215
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:37,284
he doesn't translate very well into
our generation, and his jokes are terrible.

216
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,956
But that doesn't relieve you from
your responsibility for this materiaI.

217
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,584
I'm waiting for reports from some of you.

218
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,588
I'm not joking! This is my job.

219
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,968
Come on, Mandy, l would tell you.

220
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,472
Are you and Greg doing 
the dirty deed?

221
00:18:58,972 --> 00:19:01,683
Greg doesn't believe in
premarital intercourse.

222
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,561
Too bad.

223
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:07,773
I think he's just dreamy.

224
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,778
And one, two, three, four....

225
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,085
Company, halt!

226
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,385
Dress that line.

227
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,153
Dress that line, mister!

228
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:58,866
Dress that line, soldier.

229
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,994
Mister, hold my mount.

230
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,088
You fat, disgusting slob!

231
00:20:14,673 --> 00:20:16,967
You're a goddamned disgrace!

232
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,970
A vicious mother, isn't he?

233
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,890
He can't do that to our pledges.

234
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,267
Only we can do that to our pledges.

235
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:27,686
Redo those buttons!

236
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:29,855
Dress that belt buckle!

237
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,982
Straighten that cap!

238
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,068
And goddamn it, 
tuck up those pyjamas!

239
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,072
Attention! Eyes front!

240
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,286
What's that on your chest, mister?

241
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,875
-It's a pledge pin, sir.
-A pledge pin!

242
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,377
On your uniform?

243
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,757
Hooked it. Shit.

244
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,390
Just tell me, mister, 
what fraternity would pledge...

245
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,392
a man like you?

246
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,979
It's a Delta pin, sir.

247
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,483
Slice!

248
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:24,076
Report to the stable tonight 
and every night at 1900 hours.

249
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,286
Without that pledge pin!

250
00:21:27,788 --> 00:21:29,873
Do you understand?

251
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,464
Your left arm is straight...

252
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,676
but you're not keeping your head down.

253
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:43,262
You're all worthless and weak!

254
00:21:44,388 --> 00:21:46,682
Now drop and give me 20!

255
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,568
Get back in ranks!

256
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,070
Always try to hit through the ball.

257
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,168
I've gotta work on my game.

258
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:18,672
Don't think of it as work.
The whole point is just to enjoy yourself.

259
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:27,181
l want you to fix Pinto up,
but it has to be a very special girl.

260
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:31,268
She should be decent-looking,
but we'll trade looks for...

261
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,354
a certain kind of morally casual attitude.

262
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,065
Somebody he can screw on the first date.

263
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,777
-Well put. You see, Pinto's never been laid.
-What did l say?

264
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:45,365
Don't embarrass me in front of Dave.
He's the only professor l like.

265
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:48,160
I know, Mr. 
Jennings is a wonderful teacher.

266
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:54,666
Teaching pays the rent 
till l finish my novel.

267
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:58,086
How long have you been working on it?

268
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,880
Four and a half years.

269
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,590
Must be very good.

270
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:03,383
It's a piece of shit.

271
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,474
Would anybody like to smoke some pot?

272
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,683
Yeah.

273
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,978
You ever smoked before?

274
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,855
Sure.

275
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,692
When did you ever smoke pot?

276
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:24,863
I've done a lot of things 
you don't know about.

277
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,161
I won't go schizo, will l?

278
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:14,580
There's a distinct possibility.

279
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,470
Is this right?

280
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,558
Try not to drool quite so much 
on the end of it.

281
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,073
Hey, Paula

282
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:53,160
I wanna marry you

283
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:55,954
Hey, Paula

284
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:00,292
Nobody else could ever do

285
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:04,254
I've waited so long

286
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:08,383
For school to be through

287
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,388
I can't wait no more for you

288
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:15,474
Okay.

289
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:18,977
That means that...

290
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,772
our whole solar system...

291
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:23,982
could be, like...

292
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:28,987
one tiny atom in the fingernail 
of some other giant being.

293
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,491
This is too much!

294
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,368
That means...

295
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:42,584
-one tiny atom in my fingernail could be--
-Could be one little...

296
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,254
tiny universe.

297
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,554
Could l buy some pot from you?

298
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,088
Give me that.

299
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,763
Yeah, baby.

300
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:41,268
Good baby. It's all right. You stupid....

301
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:50,485
Dorfman! 
What kind of man hits a defenceless animal?

302
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:53,280
I've got a good mind to smash your fat face.

303
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:57,284
Listen up, you nauseating pile of blubber.

304
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:02,289
Your days are numbered at Faber.
You and all your sick Delta buddies.

305
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,167
Meantime, your ass belongs to me.

306
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,253
Now, drop and give me 20.

307
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:09,588
But....

308
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,381
Hit it!

309
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,093
Trooper, baby.

310
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:22,392
Come here, baby.

311
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:27,564
Cutie-pie.

312
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:35,781
I want these quarters standing taIl 
by 0900 tomorrow.

313
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,283
-You got that?
-Yes, sir.

314
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,375
Brother D-Day, brother Bluto.

315
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,962
You hate that ying-yang?

316
00:27:50,087 --> 00:27:53,382
-Who?
-Neidermeyer. You hate his guts?

317
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:55,676
-I guess so.
-You guess so?

318
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,970
Yes, l hate him! l hate his guts!

319
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:00,556
We have an old saying in Delta

320
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,058
"Don't get mad, get even."

321
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,068
Nice horsey. Good. Let's go.

322
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,284
He's in there!

323
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,495
Boy, is this great!

324
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:08,165
Now finish it, Flounder.

325
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:12,294
Are you kidding?
l never shot anything before in my life.

326
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:15,672
-I thought you hated Neidermeyer's guts.
-I do.

327
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:20,260
And the horse? ls there anything in the world 
you hate as much as that horse?

328
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:23,388
Get it over with.

329
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:35,776
-Just blanks, right?
-Right.

330
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,662
-Holy shit!
-There were blanks in that gun!

331
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:32,457
-I didn't even point the gun at him!
-Holy shit!

332
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,459
There were blanks.

333
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,963
-Maybe he had a heart attack.
-Holy shit!

334
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:55,564
If you want the homecoming parade 
in my town...

335
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:57,482
you have to pay.

336
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:01,778
Carmine, l think it's wrong 
to extort money from the college.

337
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,282
Look...

338
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:09,161
as the mayor of Faber, 
l've got big responsibilities.

339
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,872
These parades are very expensive.

340
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,874
You're using my police...

341
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:16,960
my sanitation people, 
my free Oldsmobiles.

342
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,672
If you mention extortion again...

343
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,759
I'll have your legs broken.

344
00:31:25,761 --> 00:31:30,474
I'm sure l can arrange 
a nice honorarium from the student fund.

345
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:33,769
Another thing.

346
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:37,773
You better sit on that zoo fraternity of yours.

347
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,485
I don't want no drunken riots in my town.

348
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:45,280
Don't worry. 
I've got those boys just where l want them.

349
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:49,076
We'll have the best 
homecoming parade Faber's ever had.

350
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:19,982
Mandy!

351
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:23,694
-I haven't seen you since we--
-Go away.

352
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,155
I'm sorry, I can only stay a minute.

353
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:27,990
Let me buy you lunch.

354
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,785
You've got your lunch.
How about some milk?

355
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,371
You got your milk, too.

356
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:37,666
Can l just massage your thighs 
while you eat?

357
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:39,459
Do l have to leave?

358
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:42,379
Is this any way to treat an intimate friend?

359
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:59,873
I asked you never to speak to me again.
Will you go away?

360
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:12,594
I do hope we're not interrupting anything.

361
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,763
lf you must know--

362
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,890
-Eric was just leaving.
-I wasn't.

363
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,184
I could make you leave, if you....

364
00:34:19,476 --> 00:34:20,561
Bluto!

365
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,188
I think you know everybody here.

366
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,859
Greg, can't you--

367
00:34:26,984 --> 00:34:30,154
Don't worry. Just keep your hands and feet 
away from his mouth.

368
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,490
Don't you have any respect for yourself?

369
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:38,287
This is absolutely gross!

370
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:41,456
That boy is a P-l-G, pig!

371
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,588
See if you can guess...

372
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,464
what l am now.

373
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,768
I'm a zit. Get it?

374
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,563
All right, you bastard. 
Let's go, right here!

375
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,965
Why don't we go out tonight?

376
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,968
Don't flatter yourself. 
It wasn't that great.

377
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:41,975
Food fight!

378
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:56,865
Oh, Greg.

379
00:35:57,074 --> 00:35:58,992
Look. It's a star.

380
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,954
Let's make a wish.

381
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:08,794
-"Star light, star bright--"
-Wait a minute. That's not a star.

382
00:36:09,378 --> 00:36:10,879
It's moving too fast.

383
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:16,093
It's probably a 707. Those babies really 
can move across the sky.

384
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:24,685
Is anything happening yet? My arm's tired.

385
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,688
I'm sorry, Mandy.

386
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:31,859
That thing with the Deltas 
has me a little distracted.

387
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,779
God knows how they've molested women.

388
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:40,576
Anything?

389
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:44,288
Maybe a little faster.

390
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:45,956
Yeah.

391
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:48,292
-How's that?
-Yes.

392
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:51,587
That Eric Stratton's lucky he's not in jail.

393
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:53,881
I'll say.

394
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,757
What?

395
00:36:56,758 --> 00:36:58,177
You'll say what?

396
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:00,679
I'll say what?

397
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:05,893
You said, "l'll say," when l said, 
"He should be in jail." l'm trying to figure--

398
00:37:05,976 --> 00:37:08,562
If you're not even going to try, l'm going to stop.

399
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,481
Mandy, l....

400
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,459
-Good night, Greg.
-Good night, Mandy.

401
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,667
-She stole your boyfriend?
-Her boyfriend.

402
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,086
And not your boyfriend?

403
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:59,256
Speaking of boyfriends, 
how was your date with Greg?

404
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:00,966
Good night.

405
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,964
That's it.

406
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,976
She broke our date.

407
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,354
-Washing her hair?
-Dead mother.

408
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:02,981
We're in trouble.

409
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,194
The Jewish guys said our test answers 
were wrong.

410
00:42:07,486 --> 00:42:09,071
Every one?

411
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:15,160
Those assholes must have stolen 
the wrong fucking exam!

412
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:21,875
God, look what just creeped in.

413
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:24,169
Well, well, well.

414
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:31,593
Looks like somebody forgot there's a rule 
against aIcoholic beverages...

415
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:33,679
in fraternities on probation.

416
00:42:33,971 --> 00:42:35,180
What a tool!

417
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:36,682
What was that?

418
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,267
I said...

419
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:39,768
what a shame...

420
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,272
that a few bad apples have 
to spoil a good time...

421
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:46,692
-for everyone by breaking the rules.
-Put a sock in it...

422
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:49,778
or you'll be out like shit through a goose.

423
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:50,863
Yes, sir.

424
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:55,284
Have you boys seen 
your grade point average yet?

425
00:42:57,494 --> 00:43:00,455
-Have you?
-I have, sir. It's a little below par--

426
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,958
lt's more than a little below par.

427
00:43:04,585 --> 00:43:05,961
It stinks!

428
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:10,757
It's the lowest on campus.
It's the lowest in Faber history.

429
00:43:10,883 --> 00:43:11,967
Well, sir...

430
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:15,470
we're hoping that our midterm grades 
will help our average.

431
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:18,182
Laugh now...

432
00:43:19,057 --> 00:43:23,854
because you clowns have been 
on double secret probation all semester.

433
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:30,068
-Double secret probation?
-That means one more slip-up...

434
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,778
one more mistake...

435
00:43:32,863 --> 00:43:35,782
and this fraternity of yours has had it...

436
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,659
at Faber.

437
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,667
That was pleasant. Nice of him to stop by.

438
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:50,464
We must do something. He's serious this 
time. I think he knows about the exams.

439
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:53,175
-He's right.
-You're right. We got to do something.

440
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,177
-Absolutely.
-Know what we gotta do?

441
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,470
Toga party.

442
00:43:56,887 --> 00:44:01,058
We're on double secret probation.
We can't afford to have a toga party.

443
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:03,769
-You guys up for a toga party?
-Toga! Toga!

444
00:44:04,978 --> 00:44:08,190
-They like the idea
-Otter, please don't do this.

445
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:12,778
I've got news for you, pal. They're going to 
nail us, no matter what we do.

446
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:16,573
So we might as well have a good time.

447
00:44:17,074 --> 00:44:19,493
Toga! Toga! Toga!

448
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:35,884
It's not going to be an orgy.
It's a toga party.

449
00:44:36,885 --> 00:44:40,973
Honestly, you're 21 years old.
In six months, you graduate.

450
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:45,894
Tomorrow night, you'll wrap yourself in a sheet, 
pour grain alcohol all over your head.

451
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:50,274
-Cute, but l think l'll pass this time.
-Want me to go alone?

452
00:44:50,858 --> 00:44:53,277
I don't want you to go at all.

453
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:56,363
It's a fraternity party.

454
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,491
I'm in the fraternity.
How can l miss it?

455
00:44:59,867 --> 00:45:03,662
I'll write you a note.
I'll say you're too well to attend.

456
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:06,373
It's funny.

457
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,292
Very funny.

458
00:45:15,757 --> 00:45:18,594
-Where did he get the wheels?
-From his brother.

459
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,554
He's letting him use it for a week.

460
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:23,557
Flounder's bringing his girlfriend up 
for the weekend.

461
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:26,268
I am appointing you...

462
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:29,271
pledge representative to the social committee.

463
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,565
Gee, thanks!

464
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:35,277
-What do l do?
-Drive us to the Food King!

465
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:39,656
Food King!

466
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:52,085
Otter, please.

467
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:06,266
-What are you doing?
-Fixing your sweater. There you go.

468
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:18,862
Keep them under there, 
and keep your sweater closed.

469
00:46:19,571 --> 00:46:22,074
-I could get in trouble.
-That's right, so...

470
00:46:23,283 --> 00:46:24,576
be cool.

471
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:35,879
Mine's bigger than that.

472
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:40,968
-I beg your pardon?
-My cucumber, it's bigger.

473
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:48,392
Vegetables can be really sensuous, 
don't you think?

474
00:46:49,059 --> 00:46:50,185
No.

475
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,980
Vegetables are sensuaI.

476
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:55,566
People are sensuous.

477
00:46:55,858 --> 00:46:58,694
Right. "Sensual." That's what l meant.

478
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:02,865
My name is Eric Stratton. 
They call me Otter.

479
00:47:03,282 --> 00:47:07,077
My name's Marion.
They call me Mrs. Wormer.

480
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:09,955
We have a Dean Wormer at Faber.

481
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:15,294
What a coincidence. I have a husband 
named Dean Wormer at Faber.

482
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:21,258
You still want to show me your cucumber?

483
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,558
Nothing for me today, thanks.

484
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:34,563
It looks like you gained some weight since
you came in.

485
00:47:34,688 --> 00:47:39,359
-It's a prank. I'm pledging a fraternity.
-Don't sweat it. I won't tell.

486
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,867
The Delta Tau Chi house is having 
a party tonight, and you are cordially invited.

487
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:52,456
I'm old enough to be your mother, almost.

488
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:57,794
Besides, l have to go to the goddamn 
senior honours dinner tonight.

489
00:47:58,086 --> 00:47:59,463
Oh, well....

490
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,673
Maybe some other time.

491
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:04,968
Doubtful.

492
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:06,887
Maybe?

493
00:48:07,262 --> 00:48:10,390
So if you're not busy, 
you want to go to a fraternity party?

494
00:48:11,266 --> 00:48:15,562
-Will l be home by 12:00?
-Any time you want. I'll pick you up--

495
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:19,274
My dad would kill me if he knew 
l was going to a frat house.

496
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:20,859
Okay if l meet you there?

497
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:23,570
Is it okay? lt's terrific!

498
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,083
Girls, welcome to the Delta toga party. 
Come in.

499
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,169
Let me take your coat.

500
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:41,964
Great pair of togas.

501
00:48:42,881 --> 00:48:47,177
Have some delicious Delta punch, 
and l'll join you in a minute.

502
00:49:27,259 --> 00:49:29,595
This is Sissy, my steady girl.

503
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:32,973
This is the guy l told you about.

504
00:49:33,557 --> 00:49:37,186
You're even prettier than Kent said.
What a great dress.

505
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:42,191
-You two talk, and l'll get us some punch.
-Good idea

506
00:49:43,567 --> 00:49:45,277
He's really a lucky guy.

507
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:47,988
Why don't we go sitdown somewhere?

508
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:34,868
Sorry.

509
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,960
-You look great.
-So do you.

510
00:50:48,382 --> 00:50:50,467
I had to wait until my folks went out.

511
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:52,970
Get me some more punch.

512
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:58,475
I got a lot of catching up to do.

513
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,692
You want to dance?

514
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:09,778
Yes.

515
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,968
Yeah, Otis!

516
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,561
Gator!

517
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:53,669
-Mrs. Wormer, l'm so glad you came.
-Cut the crap.

518
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,171
Give me a drink.

519
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,763
-This is Hoover's room.
-Yeah? lt's neat.

520
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:46,884
I think it's locked or something.

521
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:50,971
Just a minute.

522
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,585
Fuck her.

523
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:23,879
Fuck her brains out.

524
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:26,882
Suck her tits. Squeeze her buns.

525
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:28,759
You know she wants it.

526
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,388
For shame!

527
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,183
Lawrence, l'm surprised at you.

528
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,853
Don't listen to that jack-off.
Look at those gazongas.

529
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,564
You'll never get a better chance.

530
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:46,568
If you lay one finger on that poor, 
sweet, helpless girl...

531
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,071
you'll despise yourself forever.

532
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:55,160
I'm proud of you, Lawrence.

533
00:58:55,994 --> 00:58:57,579
You homo!

534
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:41,456
My fault! For Christ's sake, Carmine, 
how could it be my fault?

535
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:45,294
One of those goddamn fraternities, 
l guess.

536
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:48,881
I don't know, 
but l have a pretty good idea which one.

537
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:53,886
I'm gonna string them up by the balls!

538
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,868
I bet it was that Eric Stratton.

539
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,287
You know that for sure?

540
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:21,663
No, but...

541
01:00:22,164 --> 01:00:25,292
you'd be surprised at some 
of the girls he's had.

542
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:27,794
Very surprised.

543
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:39,473
It must have been some party.

544
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,893
Unbelievable. A new low. 
I'm so ashamed.

545
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:44,770
Almost sorry l missed it.

546
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:49,066
-What did you do, human sacrifice?
-No, just some harmless fun.

547
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,194
Buy me a dinner tonight?

548
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:54,988
Can't tonight. Busy.

549
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:57,991
Busy tonight?

550
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:22,766
Please take your seats.

551
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:28,772
This meeting of the disciplinary 
council will now come to order.

552
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:33,360
We'll waive minutes and proceed directly 
with charges against Delta Tau Chi.

553
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,571
Sergeant at Arms.

554
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:46,456
The following charges are brought:

555
01:01:47,457 --> 01:01:50,669
First, 
that the Delta house did knowingly violate...

556
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:53,172
the rules governing pledge 
recruitment...

557
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:57,467
by serving alcohol to freshmen 
during pledge week...

558
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:00,470
and after established drinking hours.

559
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,682
I'd like to address these charges 
one at a time, if l may.

560
01:02:03,974 --> 01:02:06,185
You'll get your chance, smart guy.

561
01:02:06,393 --> 01:02:07,686
Get on with it.

562
01:02:08,479 --> 01:02:12,483
Second, 
that for the fifth consecutive semester...

563
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:16,195
Delta has achieved a deficient 
aggregate grade point average.

564
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:18,655
Half the houses didn't make grades.

565
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,658
You will speak when you're told to, 
and not before!

566
01:02:22,493 --> 01:02:23,494
Read.

567
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:24,786
Third...

568
01:02:25,287 --> 01:02:30,667
that the Delta fraternity routinely provided 
dangerous narcotic diet pills...

569
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,254
-to its members during--
-That's not true!

570
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:35,672
Not another word!

571
01:02:35,756 --> 01:02:38,675
...during midterm examination week.

572
01:02:41,887 --> 01:02:44,264
And most recently...

573
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:47,976
that a Roman toga party was held...

574
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:50,687
from which we have received...

575
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:54,566
two dozen reports of individual acts 
of perversion...

576
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,861
so profound and disgusting...

577
01:02:58,987 --> 01:03:01,990
that decorum prohibits listing them here.

578
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:06,078
These are the charges 
as recorded this day...

579
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:08,956
15 November, 1962.

580
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:11,083
Faithfully submitted...

581
01:03:11,166 --> 01:03:13,085
Douglas C. Neidermeyer...

582
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,170
Sergeant at Arms.

583
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:22,177
-Well done.
-Robert Hoover will speak for Delta house.

584
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,983
I don't think you can fully judge 
a fraternity...

585
01:03:36,066 --> 01:03:39,778
without looking at the positive qualities 
of the people in it.

586
01:03:39,862 --> 01:03:43,574
The Delta house has a Iong tradition 
of existence to its members...

587
01:03:43,782 --> 01:03:45,659
and to the community at large.

588
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:48,787
We've heard enough, Mr. Chairman.

589
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,582
-I was told l'd have a chance to--
-That's enough.

590
01:03:51,957 --> 01:03:53,667
The court will now decide.

591
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:57,254
-You said--
-He said that's it! Are you deaf?

592
01:03:57,754 --> 01:03:59,673
Let's finish this damn thing.

593
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:00,883
Blow job!

594
01:04:06,471 --> 01:04:10,392
-I don't think it's fair!
-I'll tell you what's fair and what's not!

595
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:11,685
Eat me!

596
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:20,486
-Tell those assholes to shut up.
-Shut up, assholes!

597
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:25,866
-Do we have to listen to this?
-Point of parliamentary procedure.

598
01:04:25,991 --> 01:04:29,578
-Don't screw around. They're serious.
-Take it easy, l'm in prelaw.

599
01:04:29,661 --> 01:04:31,955
-Thought you're premed?
-What's the difference?

600
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,791
Ladies and gentlemen, l'll be brief.

601
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:37,586
What do you think he's up to?

602
01:04:37,794 --> 01:04:41,381
The issue here is not whether we broke 
a few rules or...

603
01:04:41,757 --> 01:04:44,885
took a few liberties with our 
female party guests.

604
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,470
We did.

605
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,892
But you can't hold a whole fraternity 
responsible for the behaviour of...

606
01:04:51,975 --> 01:04:54,978
a few sick, perverted individuaIs.

607
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:57,564
If you do...

608
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:00,984
shouldn't we blame 
the whole fraternity system?

609
01:05:01,276 --> 01:05:05,155
And if the whole fraternity system 
is guilty...

610
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:10,786
then isn't this an indictment 
of our educational institutions in general?

611
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:15,165
I put it to you, Greg.

612
01:05:15,874 --> 01:05:20,462
Isn't this an indictment 
of our entire American society?

613
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:24,383
Well...

614
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:26,677
you can do what you want to us...

615
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,762
but we won't sit here...

616
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:33,267
and listen to you badmouth 
the United States of America!

617
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:34,560
Gentlemen!

618
01:05:37,771 --> 01:05:38,856
Order!

619
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:43,068
You're not walking out on this one, 
mister.

620
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,070
You're finished.

621
01:05:45,487 --> 01:05:46,572
No more Delta!

622
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:50,367
You've bought it this time, buster!

623
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,453
I'm caIling your nationaI office!

624
01:05:55,164 --> 01:05:57,374
I'm going to revoke your charter!

625
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,880
If you wise guys try one more thing...

626
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:05,757
one more, l'll kick you out of this college!

627
01:06:06,675 --> 01:06:08,468
No more fun of any kind!

628
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:36,580
When my father was in Korea, 
he wasn't flying. He was in the infantry.

629
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,582
He was an officer, of course....

630
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,794
How does it feel to be an independent?

631
01:06:43,587 --> 01:06:46,089
How does it feel to be an asshole?

632
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:48,258
What did he say?

633
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:51,762
Hoover says we can't even enter 
a float in the homecoming parade.

634
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:55,891
Some stupid zombies riding piles 
of Kleenex down the street?

635
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:57,684
Look!

636
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:05,359
Goddamn son of a bitch!
l'll kill you, you scumbag!

637
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:07,277
Jerk-off! Assholes!

638
01:07:08,487 --> 01:07:10,864
Jesus. What's going on?

639
01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:14,076
They confiscated everything, 
even the stuff we didn't steal.

640
01:07:14,993 --> 01:07:16,662
They took the bar!

641
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,289
The whole fucking bar!

642
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:46,859
Thanks. I needed that.

643
01:07:48,861 --> 01:07:49,987
Christ.

644
01:07:52,072 --> 01:07:53,782
This is ridiculous.

645
01:07:54,158 --> 01:07:55,868
What are we going to do?

646
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,287
Road trip.

647
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:01,582
You can't take the car!
Fred wrote the mileage down!

648
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:05,586
He wants it back by Sunday.
Please don't take the car!

649
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:07,963
-He'll be very mad at me!
-Get in.

650
01:08:11,466 --> 01:08:13,385
Otter, don't you understand?

651
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:16,889
He wants it back by Sunday!

652
01:08:20,767 --> 01:08:23,562
Fred's gonna kill me. 
This car is expensive!

653
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:34,072
I'll get in trouble!
We can have fun, but drive carefully!

654
01:08:34,072 --> 01:08:36,074
We won't tell anybody!

655
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:40,370
l hear Dickinson girls are fast.
What should l say?

656
01:08:41,163 --> 01:08:44,958
Mention modern art, 
civil rights or folk music, you're in like Flynn.

657
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:48,670
-You sure we have dates?
-Absolutely. What's the chick's name?

658
01:08:51,965 --> 01:08:53,592
Fawn Liebowitz.

659
01:08:54,885 --> 01:08:58,180
-She was from Fort Wayne, lndiana
-I hope l score. Oh, boy!

660
01:08:58,263 --> 01:08:59,556
Oh, boy!

661
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:10,859
Turn the car around. I'll be right back.

662
01:09:28,377 --> 01:09:30,462
-Excuse me.
-Can l help you?

663
01:09:30,879 --> 01:09:34,091
I'm here to pick up my date.
Could you ring Fawn Liebowitz?

664
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:36,385
Fawn Liebowitz?

665
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:39,388
Just a minute.

666
01:09:42,266 --> 01:09:43,475
Hello, Shelly?

667
01:09:43,559 --> 01:09:46,687
This is Brunella at the desk.
Could you come down here? Now.

668
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:50,983
A boy is here for Fawn.

669
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:52,693
Thank you.

670
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:57,573
-Is she coming down?
-Her roommate is. Fawn isn't here. She..

671
01:10:00,576 --> 01:10:02,286
Would you excuse me a minute?

672
01:10:09,793 --> 01:10:11,086
Evening.

673
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:25,684
I'm Shelly Dubinsky, Fawn's roommate.

674
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,770
I'm Frank Lymon from Amherst, 
Fawn's fiancé.

675
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:33,275
Actually, we're engaged to be engaged.

676
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:36,278
What's wrong with everyone here?

677
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:38,989
Why don't we sit down, Frank?

678
01:10:45,662 --> 01:10:47,664
I don't know how to tell you...

679
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:50,083
so l'll just tell you.

680
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:51,960
Fawn's dead.

681
01:10:53,462 --> 01:10:54,880
She's dead?

682
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:01,386
Did she put you up to this? 
That minx.

683
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,472
What a lively sense of humour.

684
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:09,186
"Sophomore dies in kiln explosion"?

685
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:16,068
-Oh, my God!
-I'm terribly sorry, Frank.

686
01:11:17,194 --> 01:11:19,488
I just talked to her last week.

687
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:23,158
She was gonna make a pot for me.

688
01:11:23,784 --> 01:11:25,994
If there's anything l can do....

689
01:11:29,164 --> 01:11:31,083
You're so nice.

690
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:36,380
-I really shouldn't impose on you.
-No, really. Anything.

691
01:11:38,674 --> 01:11:41,385
I don't think l should be alone tonight.

692
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,765
Would you go out with me?

693
01:11:48,392 --> 01:11:49,893
I'll get my coat.

694
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,983
Could you get three dates for my friends?

695
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:10,372
Otter, holy shit! Otis Day and the Knights!
l don't believe this.

696
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,961
It feels so good to be back here 
at the Dexter Lake Club.

697
01:12:16,461 --> 01:12:18,380
We'd like to do a tune entitled:

698
01:12:18,463 --> 01:12:20,257
Shama Lama Ding Dong.

699
01:12:20,465 --> 01:12:21,592
So hit it!

700
01:12:32,895 --> 01:12:36,190
Wait till Otis sees us! He loves us!

701
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,861
Oh, my God!

702
01:12:41,862 --> 01:12:44,281
It's dented!

703
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,881
We are going to die.

704
01:13:02,591 --> 01:13:04,676
We're the only white people here.

705
01:13:31,662 --> 01:13:34,456
-Are you sure--
-Don't worry about a thing, man.

706
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,674
A double rock 'n' rye, and...

707
01:13:44,675 --> 01:13:46,093
seven Carlings.

708
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,182
Otis! My man!

709
01:14:08,782 --> 01:14:10,659
You girls come here often?

710
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:17,166
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

711
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:19,793
This is really fun.

712
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,867
I'm really sorry.

713
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:56,288
I know what you must be going through.

714
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:03,670
Would you rather be alone?

715
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:22,272
-What are you majoring in?
-What?

716
01:15:22,981 --> 01:15:26,568
-What are you majoring in?
-Primitive cultures.

717
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:33,992
l need you so much.

718
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:39,873
I'm here.

719
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,171
Move to your left a little.

720
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:48,257
Good.

721
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:01,478
Where do you go to school?

722
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,067
I wonder where Otter is.
Maybe l should go look for him.

723
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:14,575
l used to touch Fawn this way.

724
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:17,995
I know.

725
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:20,080
She told me.

726
01:16:21,081 --> 01:16:22,374
She did?

727
01:16:49,776 --> 01:16:52,362
Do you mind if we dance with your dates?

728
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:57,367
Why, no, not at all. Go right ahead.

729
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:11,590
If l was in your shoes...

730
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:15,093
-I'd be--
-Leaving. What a good idea

731
01:17:23,185 --> 01:17:25,771
Compose yourself,
we got to get out of here!

732
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:29,274
The Negroes took our dates!

733
01:17:30,776 --> 01:17:33,153
Oh, my God! Please be careful!

734
01:17:34,863 --> 01:17:37,491
This will cost hundreds of dollars to fix!

735
01:17:41,078 --> 01:17:42,579
Oh, my God!

736
01:17:44,373 --> 01:17:45,457
We're out.

737
01:17:53,173 --> 01:17:57,261
What baffles me is 
why Fawn would go out with boys like that.

738
01:17:57,386 --> 01:18:00,055
-They reminded me of criminals.
-They were horrible.

739
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:02,766
I think Frank was kind of cute.

740
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,770
I really felt sorry for him.

741
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:10,482
He started crying and....

742
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,670
What did Katy say?

743
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:34,381
She wasn't home.
Where could she be at 6:00 am.?

744
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:38,677
-What's with you two?
-I don't know. Something's wrong.

745
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:43,265
Women. 
Can't live with them, can't live without them.

746
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,358
You know where Mandy is?
She was supposed to help make tea

747
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:54,860
Sure don't.

748
01:18:55,068 --> 01:18:58,280
She said she was just
going to wash her hair.

749
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:02,159
That's typical. 
Just when we're doing something important.

750
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:08,165
I hate to see her make 
such a chump out of you.

751
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,668
What are you saying?

752
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:17,674
I'm saying that Mandy and Eric Stratton 
are having an affair.

753
01:19:19,092 --> 01:19:22,471
But l love you, Greg.
That's why l had to tell you.

754
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:32,481
Babs...

755
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:35,859
I want you to do something for me.

756
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,491
Good.

757
01:19:47,871 --> 01:19:49,790
-l'm outta here.
-Katy?

758
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:51,875
Good luck.

759
01:20:37,087 --> 01:20:39,590
Hey. Stop blubbering.

760
01:20:39,673 --> 01:20:42,885
When l'm through with this thing, 
you won't even recognise it.

761
01:20:43,469 --> 01:20:45,471
Come on, Flounder.

762
01:20:45,971 --> 01:20:48,265
You can't worry forever
about your mistakes.

763
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:51,393
You fucked up. You trusted us.

764
01:20:52,186 --> 01:20:54,771
Make the best of it. 
Maybe we can help you.

765
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:58,859
That's easy for you to say.
What am l going to l tell Fred?

766
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:02,654
I'll tell you what.

767
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:07,493
I'll swear you were doing a great job 
taking care of his car, but...

768
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:12,080
you parked it out back last night, 
and this morning, it was gone.

769
01:21:12,664 --> 01:21:14,374
D-Day takes care of the wreck.

770
01:21:14,458 --> 01:21:19,588
We tell the police. 
Your brother's insurance buys him a new car.

771
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,384
Will that work?

772
01:21:25,093 --> 01:21:27,471
It's got to work better than the truth.

773
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:29,890
My advice to you...

774
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:32,392
is to start drinking heavily.

775
01:21:32,976 --> 01:21:35,979
Better listen to him. 
He's in premed.

776
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:42,069
There you go. 
Just leave everything to me.

777
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:56,375
Hi, Katy.

778
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,464
I missed you.

779
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:06,593
-l was going to call you--
-Where are they?

780
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,475
Boon, l don't know what to say.

781
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:17,354
Boon, wait!

782
01:22:19,273 --> 01:22:21,859
-Shit.
-Must be in the kitchen.

783
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:27,281
What's the matter?

784
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:35,956
There they are.

785
01:22:37,583 --> 01:22:40,586
Are you sure, Babs?
Why would Mandy want to see me?

786
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:44,089
I'm sure l don't know. 
You'll have to ask her.

787
01:22:45,591 --> 01:22:47,593
As soon as you can get there.

788
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:50,679
Well....

789
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:53,765
Do you know the Rainbow Motel 
on Old Mill Road?

790
01:22:55,893 --> 01:22:57,769
Thank you very much.

791
01:22:58,187 --> 01:22:59,354
Bye.

792
01:23:04,485 --> 01:23:05,486
Teddy!

793
01:23:06,862 --> 01:23:09,364
Did you get the Deltas' grade reports?

794
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:11,366
Yes.

795
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:12,993
I have it right here.

796
01:23:13,994 --> 01:23:15,662
Why didn't you tell me?

797
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,379
Good.

798
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:52,157
It's "Mr. Thoughtful" 
with a dozen roses for...

799
01:23:52,282 --> 01:23:53,367
you::::

800
01:23:55,494 --> 01:23:57,579
One, two, three, four, five.

801
01:23:58,372 --> 01:24:02,376
Looks like we're a couple flowers short, 
so some of you boys will have to..

802
01:24:06,088 --> 01:24:07,756
Where are the other two?

803
01:24:08,257 --> 01:24:10,759
Stratton and Schoenstein?

804
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:15,180
-We looked everywhere, sir, but....
-Never mind. It doesn't matter.

805
01:24:16,056 --> 01:24:18,392
You gentlemen seen 
your midterm grades yet?

806
01:24:18,767 --> 01:24:20,686
They're not posted yet, sir.

807
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,271
I've seen them.

808
01:24:23,981 --> 01:24:24,982
Mr. Kroger....

809
01:24:25,983 --> 01:24:28,193
Two C's, two D's, and an F.

810
01:24:28,569 --> 01:24:30,487
That's a 1.2 grade average.

811
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:34,575
Congratulations, Kroger.
You're at the top of the Delta pledge class.

812
01:24:37,161 --> 01:24:38,453
Mr. Dorfman.

813
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:40,164
Hello.

814
01:24:40,289 --> 01:24:42,166
0.2.

815
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:47,379
Fat, drunk and stupid is no way 
to go through life.

816
01:24:49,089 --> 01:24:50,257
Mr. Hoover.

817
01:24:50,757 --> 01:24:54,261
President of Delta house, 1.6...

818
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:57,890
four C's and an F. 
A fine example you set.

819
01:24:58,474 --> 01:25:00,058
Daniel Simpson Day...

820
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,771
has no grade point average.
All courses incomplete.

821
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:12,571
Mr. Blutarsky.

822
01:25:14,573 --> 01:25:17,868
0.0.

823
01:25:21,079 --> 01:25:25,792
Tell Mr. Stratton and Mr. 
Schoenstein exactly what l'm about to tell you.

824
01:25:25,876 --> 01:25:27,794
-What, sir?
-You're out!

825
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:33,258
Finished at Faber! Expelled! 
l want you off this campus Monday morning!

826
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,971
And l'm sure you'll be happy to know...

827
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:42,392
that l have notified your local draft boards...

828
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:44,770
and told them that you are now all...

829
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:49,274
eligible for military service.

830
01:25:54,363 --> 01:25:55,572
Well?

831
01:25:57,658 --> 01:25:58,992
Well?

832
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:03,872
Out with it!

833
01:26:17,469 --> 01:26:19,179
Relax, honey.

834
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:23,892
You know, l know, everybody knows 
that Otter certainly had it coming.

835
01:26:25,894 --> 01:26:29,356
I don't think the Deltas will be giving us 
any more trouble.

836
01:26:32,067 --> 01:26:33,068
Greg, honey?

837
01:26:33,861 --> 01:26:36,280
Is it supposed to be this soft?

838
01:26:39,992 --> 01:26:41,493
Christ!

839
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:45,164
Seven years of college down the drain.

840
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:48,584
Might as well join the fucking Peace Corps.

841
01:26:48,792 --> 01:26:50,794
My mother's going to kill me.

842
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:53,463
I knew it.

843
01:26:57,968 --> 01:27:01,388
l can't believe l threw up in front 
of Dean Wormer.

844
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,474
Face it.

845
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:05,976
You threw up on Dean Wormer.

846
01:27:24,077 --> 01:27:25,162
Jesus Christ!

847
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:27,956
What happened? 
You look grotesque!

848
01:27:28,457 --> 01:27:32,794
-Some Omegas danced on my face.
-Who was it?

849
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:37,966
It was Greggie and Douggie...

850
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:41,553
-and some of the other Hitler youth.
-What did you do?

851
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:43,680
I don't know.

852
01:27:44,056 --> 01:27:46,183
They're just animals, l guess.

853
01:27:49,478 --> 01:27:51,480
Looks like l missed something.

854
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,482
You did.

855
01:27:53,774 --> 01:27:56,068
We're aIl officiaIly kicked out of school.

856
01:27:56,193 --> 01:27:58,070
Wormer just got our grades.

857
01:27:59,071 --> 01:28:00,989
They kicked us out of school?

858
01:28:02,574 --> 01:28:03,992
That makes sense.

859
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:10,290
-What's this lying around shit?
-What should we do, moron?

860
01:28:10,374 --> 01:28:12,668
War's over. 
Wormer dropped the big one.

861
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:14,962
What? "Over"?

862
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,089
Did you say "over"?

863
01:28:17,464 --> 01:28:20,092
Nothing's over until we decide it is!

864
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:23,554
Was it over 
when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?

865
01:28:23,887 --> 01:28:24,888
Hell, no!

866
01:28:25,264 --> 01:28:27,266
-Germans?
-Forget it, he's rolling.

867
01:28:27,391 --> 01:28:29,560
And it ain't over now.

868
01:28:29,768 --> 01:28:32,187
'Cause when the going gets tough...

869
01:28:38,986 --> 01:28:41,488
the tough get going! Who's with me?

870
01:28:42,072 --> 01:28:43,782
Let's go! Come on!

871
01:28:57,671 --> 01:29:00,674
What the fuck happened to the Delta 
l used to know?

872
01:29:01,592 --> 01:29:03,093
Where's the spirit?

873
01:29:05,179 --> 01:29:06,555
Where's the guts?

874
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:13,187
This could be the greatest night 
of our lives...

875
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:16,356
but you're gonna let it be the worst.

876
01:29:17,483 --> 01:29:21,195
"We're afraid to go with you, Bluto.
We might get in trouble."

877
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:23,989
Just kiss my ass from now on.

878
01:29:24,364 --> 01:29:29,578
Not me! l won't take this!
Wormer is a dead man!

879
01:29:29,661 --> 01:29:33,957
--dead! Neidermeyer--
-Dead.

880
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,585
Bluto's right.

881
01:29:37,169 --> 01:29:38,378
Psychotic...

882
01:29:38,879 --> 01:29:40,589
but absolutely right.

883
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:43,967
We got to take these bastards.

884
01:29:47,554 --> 01:29:50,265
We could fight them with 
conventional weapons.

885
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:52,392
That could take years...

886
01:29:52,893 --> 01:29:54,770
cost millions of lives.

887
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:00,484
In this case...

888
01:30:00,692 --> 01:30:03,153
I think we have to go all out.

889
01:30:04,363 --> 01:30:07,074
I think this situation absolutely requires...

890
01:30:08,492 --> 01:30:12,663
a really futile and stupid gesture...

891
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:14,873
be done on somebody's part.

892
01:30:15,666 --> 01:30:17,668
We're just the guys to do it.

893
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:24,258
Let's do it.

894
01:30:24,383 --> 01:30:26,468
Let's do it!

895
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:30,556
Go! Go! Go!

896
01:31:21,773 --> 01:31:22,774
Tommy?

897
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:27,154
Hi.

898
01:31:27,488 --> 01:31:28,489
Hi.

899
01:31:29,072 --> 01:31:30,157
I'm Larry.

900
01:31:30,491 --> 01:31:32,493
Remember me? l took you to the party.

901
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,369
Wait a minute.

902
01:31:43,754 --> 01:31:46,965
So how come you show up now?
l didn't expect to see you.

903
01:31:47,174 --> 01:31:50,260
I never got a chance to say good night 
to you after the party.

904
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:53,180
They almost pumped my stomach.

905
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:55,891
Can we take a walk or something?

906
01:31:56,475 --> 01:31:59,978
-What do you mean, "or something"?
-I could get some beer.

907
01:32:00,687 --> 01:32:04,358
Not tonight, okay?
Besides, you might get lucky without it.

908
01:32:10,989 --> 01:32:14,576
Before we go any further, 
there's something l have to tell you.

909
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:17,454
I lied to you. I've never done this before.

910
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,582
You've never made out with a girl before?

911
01:32:20,666 --> 01:32:25,170
I've never done what l think we're going to do 
in a minute. I sort of did once..

912
01:32:25,254 --> 01:32:27,172
That's okay. Neither have l.

913
01:32:29,758 --> 01:32:31,385
Besides...

914
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:34,471
-l lied, too.
-Yeah? What about?

915
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:36,682
I'm only 13.

916
01:32:43,272 --> 01:32:44,481
Hi, there!

917
01:32:47,276 --> 01:32:48,694
Marvellous day.

918
01:32:48,777 --> 01:32:51,280
Excuse me, please. Pardon me.

919
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:57,786
Off that mailbox!
That's government property. Move it.

920
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:03,458
Would you hold this?

921
01:33:06,962 --> 01:33:08,380
Thank you.

922
01:33:12,384 --> 01:33:15,053
My kid can't see.
Can he stand in front of you?

923
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:16,555
No.

924
01:33:22,478 --> 01:33:23,770
Hoover!

925
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:30,360
Where's Boon?

926
01:33:30,986 --> 01:33:33,071
I don't think you should stay around here.

927
01:33:34,281 --> 01:33:36,158
What are you talking about?

928
01:33:38,494 --> 01:33:40,454
We all got expelled last night.

929
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:42,456
What?

930
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:44,082
Why?

931
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,294
-Where's Boon?
-Listen to me.

932
01:33:47,377 --> 01:33:50,088
I think you'd be glad later
if you weren't here now.

933
01:34:04,186 --> 01:34:06,563
May l have 10,000 marbles, please?

934
01:34:10,067 --> 01:34:11,193
Testing.

935
01:34:12,694 --> 01:34:16,281
It gives me great pleasure to present...

936
01:34:17,157 --> 01:34:19,993
this ceremoniaI gold-plated whistle...

937
01:34:20,994 --> 01:34:24,456
to this year's honorary grand marshaI...

938
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:27,084
Dean Vernon Wormer.

939
01:34:33,173 --> 01:34:34,591
Mr. MarshaI...

940
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:38,387
the streets of Faber are yours.

941
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:39,972
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

942
01:35:15,883 --> 01:35:16,967
Let's go.

943
01:35:51,877 --> 01:35:54,087
Sequence! Hut!

944
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,174
Faber!

945
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:49,661
Thank you, God!

946
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:56,293
Those guys are coming pretty fast.

947
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:17,981
-What the fuck's going on?
-I don't know.

948
01:38:19,775 --> 01:38:22,069
Let's stop this now. Charge!

949
01:38:36,166 --> 01:38:38,669
Get up, you faggots! Charge!

950
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:41,088
Stand up and fight, for Christ's sake!

951
01:38:49,471 --> 01:38:51,682
Faggots!

952
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:06,155
Remain calm.

953
01:39:06,572 --> 01:39:08,157
All is well.

954
01:39:28,677 --> 01:39:29,887
Cut the cake!

955
01:39:37,978 --> 01:39:38,979
Look!

956
01:39:56,788 --> 01:39:58,373
Oh, my God!

957
01:40:25,359 --> 01:40:27,194
Let's take the cheese.

958
01:40:31,865 --> 01:40:34,284
I hate those guys.

959
01:40:41,959 --> 01:40:43,377
Ramming speed!

960
01:40:57,266 --> 01:41:00,185
Oh, boy, is this great!

961
01:41:03,856 --> 01:41:05,983
All is well!

962
01:41:06,775 --> 01:41:10,362
You can take your thumb out 
of my ass any time now.

963
01:41:10,571 --> 01:41:11,780
Remain--

964
01:41:21,957 --> 01:41:25,085
This may seem an inopportune moment to ask, 
Dean Wormer...

965
01:41:25,169 --> 01:41:28,380
but do you think you could give us 
one more chance?

966
01:41:39,057 --> 01:41:40,976
Daddy! Mom!

967
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,187
This is Larry Kroger...

968
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:45,272
the boy who molested me last month.

969
01:41:45,355 --> 01:41:46,857
We have to get married.

970
01:41:46,982 --> 01:41:49,776
We should discuss this some other time, sir.

971
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:03,582
Come out of there!

972
01:42:07,377 --> 01:42:09,671
Come on out, you bastards!

973
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:12,758
-Who is it?
-You know damn well!

974
01:42:12,883 --> 01:42:16,678
l'm sorry. You'll have to come back later. 
I'm doing the dishes.

975
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:26,355
Look at my thumb.

976
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:30,192
Gee, you're dumb.

977
01:42:50,254 --> 01:42:51,255
Bye!

978
01:42:52,589 --> 01:42:54,591
Excuse me. Pardon me.

979
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:12,860
Neidermeyer!

980
01:43:52,691 --> 01:43:55,194
Don't you guys think you've had enough?

981
01:43:55,486 --> 01:43:58,363
Okay, now l'm really mad.

982
01:43:58,655 --> 01:43:59,865
Now you've had it!

983
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:04,495
Officer, please, for God's sake, 
they're looting the Food King!

984
01:44:05,370 --> 01:44:07,581
Come back and fight!

985
01:44:10,876 --> 01:44:12,795
No prisoners!

986
01:44:13,305 --> 01:44:19,637
